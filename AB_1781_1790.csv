"traffic lights are important components of traffic systems, and perceptual tasks on traffic lights are crucial for intelligent agents on the road. auxiliary countdown timers, providing the remaining time of the current traffic phase, improve the safety and smoothness of the entire traffic system. this work proposes a state estimation framework for countdown timer traffic lights. time-domain information is adequately integrated into a variable transition hidden markov model (vt-hmm), and our system provides optimal estimates of traffic light colors and countdown numbers based on noisy detection inputs. a dynamic state transition matrix is designed based on a 1-step transition logic and a probability of the number of transitions related to the current state sojourn duration. a recursive decoding method based on the viterbi algorithm is proposed to update all the state candidates and select the optimal state chain. extensive experiments evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed work. the performance boundaries of this system are also found under various input noise levels. the source code is available here: https://github.com/shuyanguni/countdown-timer-traffic-light-estimation",AB_0179
"diabetic gastroparesis (dgp) is characterized by delayed gastric emptying of solid food. nitrergic neuron-mediated fundus relaxation and intragastric peristalsis are pivotal for gastric emptying and are impaired in dgp. transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (trpv1) ion channels are expressed in gastrointestinal vagal afferent nerves and have a potential role in relevant gastrointestinal disor-ders. in this study, mice with high-fat diet (hfd)-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm), associated with gastroparesis, were used to determine the role of trpv1 in dgp. after feeding with hfd, mice exhibited obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and delayed gastric emptying. cholinergic-and nitrergic neuron-mediated neuromuscular contractions and relaxation were impaired. the antral tone of the dgp mice was attenuated. interestingly, activating or suppressing trpv1 facilitated or inhibited gastric fundus relaxation in normal mice. these effects were neutralized by using a nitric oxide synthase (nos) inhibitor. activation or suppression of trpv1 also increased or reduced no release. trpv1 was specifically localized with neuronal nos in the gastric fundus. these data suggest that trpv1 activation facilitates gastric fundus relaxation by regulating neuronal nos and promoting no release. however, these effects and mechanisms disappeared in mice with dgp induced by hfd diet. trpv1 expression was only marginally decreased in the fundus of dgp mice. trpv1 dysfunction may be a potential mechanism underlying the dysfunction of dgp gastric nitrergic neuromuscular relaxation.

"thick cloud removal is a fundamental and challenging remote sensing image processing problem, which is beneficial to subsequent analysis and application. fortunately, multi-temporal remote sensing images (mtrsis) contain highly correlated spatial-spectral-temporal (sst) information that makes it possible to solve the thick cloud removal problem. to explore the rich sst relationships of mtrsis effectively and efficiently, this paper proposes a semi-blind thick cloud removal method via sst connective tensor network decomposition (sstc-cr). specifically, the proposed model performs the subspace representation along the spectral mode of the image at each time node, and then introduces the tensor network decomposition to characterize the intrinsic relationship of the fourth-order tensor consisting of all intrinsic images under subspace representation. besides, we develop a proximal alternating minimization-based algorithm to tackle the newly-built thick cloud removal model. in the developed algorithm, we integrate the cloud removal and mask refinement by updating optimization variables and the cloud masks alternately. extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real-world mtrsis substantiate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art tensor modeling and deep learning-based methods, especially for color protection. the code is available at https://github.com/zhaoxile/sstc_cr.",AB_0179
"crowd counting in adverse hazy weather is inevitable and significant to the scene understanding in real -world application. for the crucial and challenging hazy-weather crowd counting issue, this paper proposes a single-stage hazy-weather crowd counting method based on direction-aware attention aggregation. the method develops a directional context attention (dca) block to realize embedding the positional information to the channel attention aggregation and to capture the long-range dependencies about the crowd structure, both of which guide the counting method readily locate the crowd of interest. due to the lack of the hazy-weather crowd counting benchmark datasets, we also generate the hazy-weather crowd counting datasets to evaluate the proposed method. experimental results and the discussions demonstrate our method is effective greatly on the hazy-weather crowd counting task, especially the design of the core dca block. in this research work, both the proposed method and the generated benchmark datasets in hazy-weather scene facilitate the development of the crowd counting in the adverse weather conditions and the universal intelligent surveillance technologies. the generated hazy-weather crowd counting benchmarks datasets (hazy-shanghaitechrgbd and hazy-jhu) in this paper would be released in https://github.com/312524/hazy-cc after peer-review process of this work to facilitate further research.",AB_0179
"this paper develops a novel nature-inspired metaheuristic technique named snow ablation optimizer (sao) for numerical optimization and engineering design. the sao algorithm mainly emulates the sublimation and melting behavior of snow to realize a tradeoff between exploitation and exploration in the solution space and discourage premature convergence. the competitiveness and effectiveness of sao are validated utilizing 29 typical cec2017 unconstrained benchmarks and 22 cec2020 real-world constrained optimization issues which consist of 7 process synthesis and design issues and 15 mechanical engineering issues. additionally, to further verify its strength, the developed sao is applied to extract the core parameters in photovoltaic systems. the simulation outcomes have demonstrated that the developed sao is a very promising technique that can yield better performance than other state-of-the-art rival methods. the source code of sao is publicly available at https://github.com/denglingyun123/sao-snow-ablation-optimizer.",AB_0179
"point set registration is the technology used to estimate the spatial transformation between two lidar scans, which is challenging in the presence of outlier correspondences and noise. our focus is on 4 degrees of freedom (dof) point set registration, in which 1dof rotation and 3dof translation need to be estimated. it is commonly found in practical scenarios, such as arbitrarily mobile robots equipped with an inertial measurement unit (imu), terrestrial lidar scanners, or planar moving vehicles in urban environments. recently, many solutions have leveraged branch and bound (bnb) in global and deterministic approaches to solve the registration problem with performance guarantees. however, bnb-based methods are usually time-consuming since their convergence speed is exponential to the dimensionality of the solution domain, and existing methods estimate these 4dof simultaneously. our key idea is to speed up bnb-based methods by decoupling the joint pose into separate translation and rotation with the aid of known gravity directions. this effectively reduces the search domain to 3dof+1dof, thereby enhancing algorithm efficiency. specifically, we propose a novel bnb-based consensus maximization method for a fast 3dof translation search and derive the specific lower and upper bound functions. we then propose an efficient global voting method for estimating the rotation with 1dof. to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. the experimental results show that (1) our proposed method is more robust against outliers and noise than several existing methods and far faster than the existing bnb-based 4dof method by almost an order of magnitude, (2) our proposed method is robust against the biases in gravity directions, such that the general error of the imu is acceptable, and (3) thanks to its significant robustness, our proposed method can solve the challenging problem of simultaneous pose and correspondence registration (spcr). moreover, the proposed approach is also more robust and accurate than several spcr benchmark methods. code is available at https://github.com/xinyi-tum/fast-and-deterministic-registration.",AB_0179
"colon cancer is a common cancer type in both sexes and its mortality rate increases at the metastatic stage. most studies exclude nondifferentially expressed genes from biomarker analysis of metastatic colon cancers. the motivation of this study is to find the latent associations of the nondifferentially expressed genes with metastatic colon cancers and to evaluate the gender specificity of such associations. this study formulates the expression level prediction of a gene as a regression model trained for primary colon cancers. the difference between a gene's predicted and original expression levels in a testing sample is defined as its mqtrans value (model-based quantitative measure of transcription regulation), which quantitatively measures the change of the gene's transcription regulation in this testing sample. we use the mqtrans analysis to detect the messenger rna (mrna) genes with nondifferential expression on their original expression levels but differentially expressed mqtrans values between primary and metastatic colon cancers. these genes are referred to as dark biomarkers of metastatic colon cancer. all dark biomarker genes were verified by two transcriptome profiling technologies, rna-seq and microarray. the mqtrans analysis of a mixed cohort of both sexes could not recover gender-specific dark biomarkers. most dark biomarkers overlap with long non-coding rnas (lncrnas), and these lncrnas might have contributed their transcripts to calculating the dark biomarkers' expression levels. therefore, mqtrans analysis serves as a complementary approach to identify dark biomarkers generally ignored by conventional studies, and it is essential to separate the female and male samples into two analysis experiments. the dataset and mqtrans analysis code are available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/22250536.",AB_0179
"anticancer peptides (acps), a series of short bioactive peptides, are promising candidates in fighting against cancer due to their high activity, low toxicity, and not likely cause drug resistance. the accurate identification of acps and classification of their functional types is of great importance for investigating their mechanisms of action and developing peptide-based anticancer therapies. here, we provided a computational tool, called acp-mlc, to address binary classification and multi-label classification of acps for a given peptide sequence. briefly, acp-mlc is a two-level prediction engine, in which the 1st-level model predicts whether a query sequence is an acp or not by random forest algorithm, and the 2nd-level model predicts which tissue types the sequence might target by the binary relevance algorithm. development and evaluation by high-quality datasets, our acp-mlc yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) of 0.888 on the independent test set for the 1st-level prediction, and obtained 0.157 hamming loss, 0.577 subset accuracy, 0.802 f1-scoremacro, and 0.826 f1-scoremicro on the independent test set for the 2nd-level prediction. a systematic comparison demon-strated that acp-mlc outperformed existing binary classifiers and other multi-label learning classifiers for acp prediction. finally, we interpreted the important features of acp-mlc by the shap method. user-friendly software and the datasets are available at https://github.com/nicole-dh/acp-mlc. we believe that the acp-mlc would be a powerful tool in acp discovery.",AB_0179
"3d object detection using point clouds has received a lot of attention in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and virtual reality. however, feature learning for 3d object detection from point cloud is very challenging due to the irregularity and sparsity of 3d point cloud data. grid-based methods convert irregular point clouds into regular 2d views or 3d voxels and then use 2d cnn or 3d cnn for feature learning, but the point cloud transformation process will inevitably cause quantization loss. point-based methods use the pointnet network to directly learn the features of the point cloud, but the semantic information obtained by pointnet may be incomplete. to address the above issues, we propose a novel gateway attention-based point set abstraction 3d object detector (gapsa) to learn geometric and semantic point cloud features. specifically, the framework utilizes set abstraction downsampling points and performs local feature extraction on the sampling points through the proposed gateway attention pooling module to learn more discriminative point cloud features. given the high-quality 3d proposals generated by attention-based backbone networks, we design a roi multi -pooling head to adaptively learn features for sparse points of interest within proposals, so as to encode richer contextual information and obtain fine-grained features to accurately estimate object confidence and location. compared with advanced point-based 3d object detectors, experimental results demonstrate that our attention -based point set abstraction 3d object detector has the best detection performance on kitti and nuscenes datasets. the code is available at https://github.com/liuhuaijjin/gapsa.",AB_0179
"because of the increasing complexity and nonlinearity of industrial processes, nonlinear model predictive control (nmpc) has been rapidly developed owing to its fast response and robustness. however, the complicated optimization process of nmpc limits its application. hence, this paper proposes an nmpc method that is compatible with nonlinear modeling and concise online control. first, an elastic autoregressive fuzzy neural network (eafnn) is proposed under reasonable assumptions. the eafnn exhibits strong parameter identification and structure optimization capabilities because of its autoregressive layer and elastic mechanism. second, the eafnn is adaptively simplified into a linear model based on the real-time working condition information during online control. third, based on a simplified model, nmpc provides an explicit solution without complex optimization procedures. finally, numerical simulations and roasting process experiments are conducted. experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits superior control performance and computational complexity compared with other methods, thereby verifying its effectiveness and superiority. the source code for eafnn-mpc is publicly available at: https://github.com/553318570/eafnn_mpc.git.",AB_0179
