"recent research in deep learning has greatly advanced the development of monocular visual depth estimation and odometry. these learning-based methods predominantly leverage neural networks to extract prevalent high-dimensional features for regression-based estimation. however, the consistency of observations is still regarded as a core challenge that limits the generalization ability. we attribute this challenge to the significant inconsistency in feature levels due to changes in the environment or motion, collectively referred to as observation variation. to this end, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation and a pose estimation network with attention mechanism to recalibrate features for different environment. the depth and ego -motion estimation tasks are formulated by coupling together in an end-to-end reconstruction problem, and attention modules adaptively recalibrate specific feature responses. furthermore, we propose a simple sliding window optimization without rnn-based architecture, which is introduced to overcome the movement speed variation and error accumulation. finally, we collect an observation variation dataset with environmental and motion changes. evaluations of depth and pose estimation demonstrate that our methods effectively overcomes these observation variation challenges and achieves better performance. our project will be available at https://github.com/alikesierzhao/ov-sfmlearner.",AB_0137
"the identification of hotspot residues at the protein-dna binding interfaces plays a crucial role in various aspects such as drug discovery and disease treatment. although experimental methods such as alanine scanning mutagenesis have been developed to determine the hotspot residues on protein-dna interfaces, they are both inefficient and costly. therefore, it is highly necessary to develop efficient and accurate computational methods for predicting hotspot residues. several computational methods have been developed, however, they are mainly based on hand-crafted features which may not be able to represent all the information of proteins. in this regard, we propose a model called pdh-eh, which utilizes fused features of embeddings extracted from a protein language model (plm) and handcrafted features. after we extracted the total 1141 dimensional features, we used mrmr to select the optimal feature subset. based on the optimal feature subset, several different learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine, and xgboost were used to build the models. the cross-validation results on the training dataset show that the model built by using random forest achieves the highest auroc. further evaluation on the independent test set shows that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models. moreover, the effectiveness and interpretability of embeddings extracted from plm were demonstrated in our analysis. the codes and datasets used in this study are available at: https://github.com/ lixiangli01/pdh-eh.",AB_0137
"using depth estimation joint target detection networks to locate targets in the uav field of view is a novel application in the depth estimation research field. the presence of more depth variations and low-texture regions in the ultra-low altitude oblique photographic images make them trickier to train for an excellent depth estimation network compared to autonomous driving scenarios. this presents a challenge in achieving optimal training. this study investigates the problem of unsupervised monocular depth estimation for ultra-low altitude oblique photography images. it aims to make subsequent advanced vision tasks better benefit from excellent depth estimation results in terms of overcoming complex scenes. the lack of effective back-projection directionality in training using adjacent frames is attributed to the extensive low-textured areas contained in the training data for complex ultra-low altitude oblique photography. we propose a self-supervised scene-aware refinement learning architecture from the perspective of enhancing feature perception to deal with such problems. the architecture consists of a multi-resolution feature fusion depth network and a perceptual refinement network (prnet), together with a pose network to enhance regional differences in complex environments from a refined feature context perspective to obtain higher quality depth maps. we rethink the problem of depth information recovery and design the edge information aggregation (eia) module, which is configured in the decoder section to refine the local region depth detail representation. we design several loss terms to constrain the training of the network in order to improve the quality of depth estimation. our method is compared with six state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods on three datasets (uavid 2020, wilduav, uav ula). the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the best performance in most scenarios. the code and the private dataset (uav ula) can be publicly available at https://github.com/takisu0916/mrfedepth.",AB_0137
"a comprehensive understanding of protein functions holds significant promise for disease research and drug development, and proteins with analogous tertiary structures tend to exhibit similar functions. protein fold recognition stands as a classical approach in the realm of protein structure investigation. despite significant advancements made by researchers in this field, the continuous updating of protein databases presents an ongoing challenge in accurately identifying protein fold types. in this study, we introduce a predictor, rescnnt-fold, for protein fold recognition and employ the le dataset for testing purpose. rescnnt-fold leverages a pre-trained language model to obtain embedding representations for protein sequences, which are then processed by the rescnnt feature extractor, a combination of residual convolutional neural network and transformer, to derive fold-specific features. subsequently, the query protein is paired with each protein whose structure is known in the template dataset. for each pair, the similarity score of their fold-specific features is calculated. ultimately, the query protein is identified as the fold type of the template protein in the pair with the highest similarity score. to further validate the utility and efficacy of the proposed rescnnt-fold predictor, we conduct a 2-fold cross-validation experiment on the fold level of the le dataset. remarkably, this rigorous evaluation yields an exceptional accuracy of 91.57%, which surpasses the best result among other state-of-the-art protein fold recognition methods by an approximate margin of 10%. the excellent performance unequivocally underscores the compelling advantages inherent to our proposed rescnnt-fold predictor in the realm of protein fold recognition. the source code and data of rescnnt-fold can be downloaded from https://github.com/bioinformatics-laboratory/rescnnt-fold.",AB_0137
"background: statistically, anterior communicating aneurysm (acoa) accounts for 30 to 35% of intracranial aneurysms. acoa, once ruptured, will have an acute onset and cause severe neurological dysfunction and even death. therefore, clinical analysis of risk factors related to acoa and the establishment of prediction model are the benefits to the primary prevention of acoa.methods: among 1,436 cases of single acoa patients, we screened 1,325 valid cases, classified risk factors of 1,124 cases in the ruptured group and 201 cases in the unruptured group, and assessed the risk factors, respectively, and predicted the risk of single acoa rupture by using the logistic regression and the machine learning.results: in the ruptured group (84.8%) of 1,124 cases and the unruptured group (15.2%) of 201 cases, the multivariable logistic regression (mlr) model shows hemorrhagic stroke history (or 95%ci, p:0.233 (0.120-0.454),<0.001) and the age stratification of 60-69 years (or 95%ci, p:0.425 (0.271-0.668),<0.001) has a significant statistic difference. in the randomforest (rf) model, hemorrhagic stroke history and age are the best predictive factors.conclusion: we combined the analysis of mlr, rf, and pca models to conclude that hemorrhagic stroke history and gender affect single acoa rupture. the rf model with web dynamic nomogram, allows for real-time personalized analysis based on different patients' conditions, which is a tremendous advantage for the primary prevention of single acoa rupture.clinical trial registration https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=178501.",AB_0137
"background: complete resection of the tumor and the ipsilateral thyroid lobe at the primary surgery is the gold standard for the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma (pc). however, differences in the overall survival (os) of patients with pc who underwent partial and total surgical resection remain to be determined.methods: data on patients with pc who underwent partial and total surgical resection were extracted from the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (seer) database (2000-2018). the x-tile software (https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/rimm/research/software/) was used to define the optimal cut-off values for continuous variables. the inverse probability of treatment weighting (iptw) method was used to reduce the selection bias. iptw-adjusted kaplan-meier curves and cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the os of patients with pc in the partial and total surgical resection groups.results: a total of 334 patients with pc were included in this study (183 and 151 in the partial and total surgical resection groups, respectively). the optimal cut-off values for age at diagnosis were 53 and 73 years, respectively, while that for tumor size was 34 mm. in both the kaplan-meier analysis and univariable cox proportional hazards regression analysis before iptw, the difference in os between the partial and total surgical resection groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05). these findings were confirmed in the iptw-adjusted kaplan-meier analysis and multivariate cox proportional hazards regression analysis (p>0.05). subgroup analysis revealed that total surgical resection was beneficial for os only in the subgroup with unknown tumor size.conclusion: there was no significant difference in the prognosis of patients who underwent partial and total surgical resection. this finding may provide a useful reference for the treatment of pc.",AB_0137
"medical image segmentation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment in the medical field. in recent years, convolutional neural networks (cnns) and transformers have been frequently adopted as network architectures in medical image segmentation. the convolution operation is limited in modeling long-range dependencies because it can only extract local information through the limited receptive field. in comparison, transformers demonstrate excellent capability in modeling long-range dependencies but are less effective in capturing local information. hence, effectively modeling long-range dependencies while preserving local information is essential for accurate medical image segmentation. in this paper, we propose a four-axis fusion framework called fafuse, which can exploit the advantages of cnn and transformer. as the core component of our fafuse, a four-axis fusion module (faf) is proposed to efficiently fuse global and local information. faf combines four-axis attention (height, width, main diagonal, and counter diagonal axial attention), a multi-scale convolution, and a residual structure with a depth-separable convolution and a hadamard product. furthermore, we also introduce deep supervision to enhance gradient flow and improve overall performance. our approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets. the code is available at https://github.com/cczu-xiao/fafuse.",AB_0137
"ischemic stroke (is) is a common and severe condition that requires intensive care unit (icu) admission, with high mortality and variable prognosis. accurate and reliable predictive tools that enable early risk stratification can facilitate interventions to improve patient outcomes; however, such tools are currently lacking. in this study, we developed and validated novel ensemble learning models based on soft voting and stacking methods to predict in-hospital mortality from is in the icu using two public databases: mimic-iv and eicu-crd. addi-tionally, we identified the key predictors of mortality and developed a user-friendly online prediction tool for clinical use. the soft voting ensemble model, named icu-ispm, achieved an auroc of 0.861 (95% ci: 0.829-0.892) and 0.844 (95% ci: 0.819-0.869) in the internal and external test cohorts, respectively. it significantly outperformed the apache scoring system and was more robust than individual models. icu-ispm obtained the highest performance compared to other models in similar studies. using the shap method, the model was interpretable, revealing that gcs score, age, and intubation were the most important predictors of mortality. this model also provided a risk stratification system that can effectively distinguish between low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. therefore, the icu-ispm is an accurate, reliable, interpretable, and clinically applicable tool, which is expected to assist clinicians in stratifying is patients by the risk of mortality and rationally allocating medical resources. based on icu-ispm, an online risk prediction tool was further developed, which was freely available at: http://ispm.idrblab.cn/.",AB_0137
"drug-induced liver injury (dili) is a significant cause of drug failure and withdrawal due to liver damage. accurate prediction of hepatotoxic compounds is crucial for safe drug development. several dili prediction models have been published, but they are built on different data sets, making it difficult to compare model performance. moreover, most existing models are based on molecular fingerprints or descriptors, neglecting molecular geometric properties and lacking interpretability. to address these limitations, we developed geodili, an interpretable graph neural network that uses a molecular geometric representation. first, we utilized a geometry-based pretrained molecular representation and optimized it on the dili data set to improve predictive performance. second, we leveraged gradient information to obtain high-precision atomic-level weights and deduce the dominant substructure. we benchmarked geodili against recently published dili prediction models, as well as popular gnn models and fingerprint-based machine learning models using the same data set, showing superior predictive performance of our proposed model. we applied the interpretable method in the dili data set and derived seven precise and mechanistically elucidated structural alerts. overall, geodili provides a promising approach for accurate and interpretable dili prediction with potential applications in drug discovery and safety assessment. the data and source code are available at github repository (https://github.com/csu-qjy/geodili).",AB_0137
"predicting drug-target interaction (dti) is a crucial step in the process of drug repurposing and new drug development. although the attention mechanism has been widely used to capture the interactions between drugs and targets, it mainly uses the simplified molecular input line entry system (smiles) and two-dimensional (2d) molecular graph features of drugs. in this paper, we propose a neural network model called mddti for dti prediction. the model searches for binding sites that may interact with the target from the multiple dimensions of drug structure, namely the 2d substructures and the three-dimensional (3d) spatial structure. for the 2d substructures, we have developed a novel substructure decomposition strategy based on drug molecular graphs and compared its performance with the smiles-based decomposition method. for the 3d spatial structure of drugs, we constructed spatial feature representation matrices for drugs based on the cartesian coordinates of heavy atoms (without hydrogen atoms) in each drug. finally, to ensure the search results of the model are consistent across multiple dimensions, we construct a consistency loss function. we evaluate mddti on four drug-target interaction datasets and three independent compound-protein affinity test sets. the results indicate that our model surpasses a series of state-of-the-art models. case studies demonstrate that our model is capable of capturing the potential binding regions between drugs and targets, and it shows efficacy in drug repurposing. our code is available at https://github.com/lhhu1999/mddti.",AB_0137
