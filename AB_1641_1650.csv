"machine-learning-basedscoring functions (mlsfs) have gained attentionfor their potential to improve accuracy in binding affinity predictionand structure-based virtual screening (sbvs) compared to classicalsfs. developing accurate mlsfs for sbvs requires a large and unbiaseddataset that includes structurally diverse actives and decoys. unfortunately,most datasets suffer from hidden biases and data insufficiency. here,we developed topology-based and conformation-based decoys database(tocoddb). the biological targets and active ligands in tocoddb werecollected from scientific literature and established datasets. thedecoys were generated and debiased by using conditional recurrentneural networks and molecular docking. tocoddb is presently the largestunbiased database with 2.4 million decoys encompassing 155 targets.the detailed information and performance benchmark for each targetare provided, which are beneficial for training and evaluating mlsfs.moreover, the online decoys generation function of tocoddb furtherexpands its application range to any target. tocoddb is freely availableat http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/tocodecoy/.",AB_0165
"recent advances in two-view correspondence learning consider aggregating local contextual information from k-nearest neighbors by exploring local geometric extractors using convolution, graph or self-attention. however, there is no guarantee that the extracted local context is conducive to correspondence pruning, since there are typically over 90% outliers in the putative set which would inevitably result in contaminated neighbors and hence contaminated local context. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose the rna-gnn, an attentional graph neural network (gnn) architecture, which can explicitly model interactions among relevant neighboring correspondences. specifically, a reciprocal neighbor attention (rna) module is designed to operate sparse attention on relevant neighbors only rather than all neighbors, mitigating the interference of irrelevant and redundant connectivity, and learning more compact and robust representation. in addition, considering that seeking reliable correspondences requires both local and global context, we introduce a context-aware attention module to extract global and channel-wise context by means of global weighted average pooling with weights that are estimated within the network, excluding outliers from this pooling. extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that rna-gnn substantially advances current state-of-the-arts on camera pose estimation, homography estimation, and remote sensing image registration. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zizhuoli/rna-gnn.",AB_0165
"protein-rna interactions play a key role in various biological cellular processes, and many experimental and computational studies have been initiated to analyze their interactions. however, experimental determination is quite complex and expensive. therefore, researchers have worked to develop efficient computational tools to detect protein-rna binding residues. the accuracy of existing methods is limited by the features of the target and the performance of the computational models; there remains room for improvement. to solve the problem of the accurate detection of protein-rna binding residues, we propose a convolutional network model named pbrpre based on improved mobilenet. first, by extracting the position information of the target complex and the 3-mer amino acid feature data, the position-specific scoring matrix (pssm) is improved by using spatial neighbor smoothing processing and discrete wavelet transform to fully exploit the spatial structure information of the target and enrich the feature dataset. second, the deep learning model mobilenet is used to integrate and optimize the potential features in the target complexes; then, by introducing the vision transformer (vit) network classification layer, the deep-level information of the target is mined to enhance the processing ability of the model for global information and to improve the detection accuracy of the classifiers. the results show that the auc value of the model can reach 0.866 in the independent testing dataset, which shows that pbrpre can effectively realize the detection of protein-rna binding residues. all datasets and resource codes of pbrpre are available at https://github.com/linglewu/pbrpre for academic use.",AB_0165
"background for patients with low- and intermediate-risk stage ii/iii rectal cancer, current studies have reached a consensus that preoperative radiotherapy may be dispensed with, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nct) alone might achieve an accepted local control. our previous phase ii study has evidenced that the morphological response of nct could be better judged at a relatively early stage. low- and intermediate-risk stage ii/iii rectal cancer patients could achieve a high rate of tumor shrinkage and downgrade after only 4 cycles of nct and obvious tumor morphological changes could be observed after 2 cycles of nct. however, there is still a lack of more detailed stratification and evidence for pathological criteria. the aim of the present study (comparison of the pathological response to 2 or 4 cycles of neoadjuvant capox in ii/iii rectal cancer patients with low/intermediate risks, copec trial) is to determine the pathological tumor regression grade (ptrg) rate of 2 or 4 cycles of nct in low- and intermediate-risk stage ii/iii rectal cancer and verify the feasibility of early identification of chemotherapy-insensitive population. methods/design this is a multicenter, prospective, non-inferior, randomized controlled trial (rct) initiated by west china hospital of sichuan university and designed to be conducted in fourteen hospitals around china. eligible patients will be centrally randomized into 2 or 4 cycles of capox in a 1:1 ratio using the central automated randomization ysystem offered by the o-trial online system (https://plus.o-trial.com/) and accept total mesorectal excision after 2 or 4 cycles of capox (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2, once daily on day 1, every 21 days and capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2), twice daily on days 1 to 14, every 21 days). the primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with pathological no-tumor regression (ptrg 3), which is determined postoperatively by each sub-center and verified by the primary center. discussion copec trial is designed to verify that the preoperative capox chemotherapy for low- and intermediaterisk stage ii/iii rectal cancer could achieve a good response judgment after 2 cycles and obtain the tumor pathological response rate after 2 cycles of capox. we hope the copec trial could help in establishing a consensus standard of low- and intermediate-risk rectal cancer and the early identification of stage ii/iii rectal patients with low- and intermediate-risk who are poorly responding to nct. trial registration clinicaltrial.gov nct04922853. registered on june 4, 2021.",AB_0165
"feature matching is an essential step in a wide range of photogrammetry and computer vision tasks but limited by the ambiguities of local descriptors. hence, numerous false feature matches (outliers) will inevitably be generated, especially in complex scenarios. motion coherence can establish the statistical relationships among sparse motions to remove outliers, assuming that the true matches are coherent, and the false matches are randomly scattered. however, existing methods model motion coherence either in a local spatial context or without considering rich matching priors, thereby leading to numerous matching failures when outlier rates are high. in this study, we propose a context-enhanced motion coherence modeling (como) method to distinguish consistent correct motions from erroneous matches for robust outlier rejection. the como method deploys a consistency-aware motion descriptor to encode the consistency-related matching priors of feature matches as a high-dimensional representation, which can provide a rich context for differentiating heterogeneous motions. based on this discriminative descriptor, we further introduce deformable affine transformation (dat) as a proxy for motion and fit the coherent motions from the candidate matches with a globally smooth function under the truncated least squares estimation framework. extensive experiments on multiple large datasets (including the image matching challenge at cvpr 2020) demonstrate that the como method can effectively model motion coherence from noisy candidate matches and outperform other state-of-the-art methods in outlier rejection and relative camera pose estimation. the code is available at https://github.com/geovsion/como.",AB_0165
"salient object detection (sod) is essential for home service robot grasping technology. recently, studies have shown that using triple-modality (rgb-depth-thermal infrared, rgb-d-t) information can significantly improve the detection effect of salient object detection. the location accuracy and completeness of the salient object play a crucial role in the subsequent grasping process. this seriously affects the robot's judgment of the object position and grasping position. therefore, the critical problem of triple-modality sod technology in robot grasping is locating the salient object accurately and detecting the salient object completely. consequently, we propose a triple-modality salient object detection method based on hierarchical two-stage modal fusion. in the first fusion stage, we use the triple-modal information rationally to locate the salient object accurately. considering the properties of the different modal information, we use the depth information to supplement and improve the visible light and thermal infrared information through an accurate selection fusion module (asfm). then in the second stage, we use the feature correlation enhancement module (fcem) to realize the correlation of the different modal salient features. fcem can perfectly combine the different modal information and make the salient object more complete. comparative and challenging experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods on the vdt2048 dataset. the code is available at: https://github. com/vdt-2048/htmf.",AB_0165
"monocular depth estimation has seen significant progress in recent years, especially in outdoor scenes. however, depth estimation results are not satisfying in omnidirectional images. as compared to perspective images, esti-mating the depth map from an omnidirectional image captured in the outdoor scene, using neural networks, has two additional challenges: (i) the depth range of outdoor images varies a lot across different scenes, making it difficult for the depth network to predict accurate depth results for training with an indoor dataset, besides the maximum distance in outdoor scenes mostly stays the same as the camera sees the sky, but depth labels in this region are entirely missing in existing datasets; (ii) a standard representation of omnidirectional images intro-duces spherical distortion, which causes difficulties for the vanilla network to predict accurate relative structural depth details. in this paper, we propose a novel network-mode by giving special considerations to those challenges and designing a set of flexible modules for improving the performance of omnidirectional depth esti-mation. first, a consistent depth structure module is proposed to estimate a consistent depth structure map, and the predicted structural map can improve depth details. second, to suit the characteristics of spherical sampling, we propose a strip convolution fusion module to enhance long-range dependencies. third, rather than using a single depth decoder branch as in previous methods, we propose a semantics decoder branch to estimate sky re-gions in the omnidirectional image. the proposed method is validated on three widely used datasets, demon-strating the state-of-the-art performance. moreover, the effectiveness of each module is shown through an ablation study on real-world datasets. our code is available at https://github.com/lkku1/mode.& copy; 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0165
"accurate, rapid, and smart pest recognition and detection are important for crop protection and management. existing deep learning-based pest detection algorithms often require high computing resources and computational memory. in addition, detection of small and high-density pests (e.g., sugarcane aphids (scas)) in unstructured natural environments still remains challenging due to the small target size, natural illumination, and background noises. here, we developed a lightweight ssv2-yolo (stem-shufflenet v2-yolov5s) model based on yolov5s (you only look once, version 5, small) for sca detection by reconstructing the backbone network with stem and shufflenet v2 and adjusting the neck network width. we further refactored the feature level, data augmentation method, and loss function to improve detection performance for small, high-density, and overlapping targets. the newly developed ssv2-yolo model was trained and tested using a mobile phone sca image dataset (n = 860) covering both uniform and unstructured natural environments. compared with the original yolov5s, ssv2-yolo significantly reduced model complexity, e.g., reduced parameter number (by 95.1%), model size (by 92.5%), and floating point of operations (by 81.6%), and showed increased detection speed (gpu by 31.6% and cpu by 81.8%) and improved accuracy (by 2.5%). ssv2-yolo also outperformed the best state-ofthe-art algorithms for sca detection under severe adhesion and unstructured farmland conditions. we found 640 x 640 as the best image pixel resolution to improve model detection performance without affecting model size. our study showed that ssv2-yolo has clear advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and lightweight, which can be potentially used for the automatic detection of scas on mobile devices. the evaluation code and dataset are available at https://github.com/weiyuexu/scas-ssv2-yolo.",AB_0165
"with the continuous development ofribosome profiling, sequencingtechnology, and proteomics, evidence is mounting that noncoding rna(ncrna) may be a novel source of peptides or proteins. these peptidesand proteins play crucial roles in inhibiting tumor progression andinterfering with cancer metabolism and other essential physiologicalprocesses. therefore, identifying ncrnas with coding potential isvital to ncrna functional research. however, existing studies performwell in classifying ncrnas and mrnas, and no research has been explicitlyraised to distinguish whether ncrna transcripts have coding potential.for this reason, we propose an attention mechanism-based bidirectionallstm network called ablncpp to assess the coding possibility of ncrnasequences. considering the sequential information loss in previousmethods, we introduce a novel nonoverlapping trinucleotide embedding(nolte) method for ncrnas to obtain embeddings containing sequentialfeatures. the extensive evaluations show that ablncpp outperformsother state-of-the-art models. in general, ablncpp overcomes the bottleneckof ncrna coding potential prediction and is expected to provide valuablecontributions to cancer discovery and treatment in the future. thesource code and data sets are freely available at https://github.com/yinggggj/ablncpp.",AB_0165
"meta-heuristic algorithms are an essential way to solve realistic optimization problems. developing effective, accurate, and stable meta-heuristic algorithms has become the goal of optimization research. snake optimizer (so) is a novel algorithm with good optimization results. however, due to the limitations of natural laws, the parameters are more fixed values in the exploration and exploitation phase, so the so algorithm quickly falls into local optimization and slowly converges. this paper proposes an enhanced snake optimizer (eso) by introducing a novel opposition-based learning strategy and new dynamic update mechanisms (parameter dynamic update strategy, sine-cosine composite perturbation factors, tent-chaos & cauchy mutation) to achieve better performance. the effectiveness of eso has been tested on 23 classic benchmark functions and the cec 2019 function set. 13 functions of 23 classic benchmark functions have variants that belong to multiple dimensions (dim = 30, 100, 500, 1000, and 2000). in addition, eso is also used to solve four real-world engineering design problems. experimental results and two statistical tests show that the proposed eso performs better than the other 13 state-of-the-art algorithms, including so. the matlab code of eso is available from: https://ww2. mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/120173-eso-an-enhanced-snake-optimizer.",AB_0165
