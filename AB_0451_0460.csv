"the mgnify platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) facilitates the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome-derived nucleic acid sequences. the platform provides access to taxonomic assignments and functional annotations for nearly half a million analyses covering metabarcoding, metatranscriptomic, and metagenomic datasets, which are derived from a wide range of different environments. over the past 3 years, mgnify has not only grown in terms of the number of datasets contained but also increased the breadth of analyses provided, such as the analysis of long-read sequences. the mgnify protein database now exceeds 2.4 billion non-redundant sequences predicted from metagenomic assemblies. this collection is now organised into a relational database making it possible to understand the genomic context of the protein through navigation back to the source assembly and sample metadata, marking a major improvement. to extend beyond the functional annotations already provided in mgnify, we have applied deep learning-based annotation methods. the technology underlying mgnify's application programming interface (api) and website has been upgraded, and we have enabled the ability to perform downstream analysis of the mgnify data through the introduction of a coupled jupyter lab environment.",AB_0046

"dysregulation of rna splicing contributes to bothrare and complex diseases. rna-sequencing datafrom human tissues has shown that this process canbe inaccurate, resulting in the presence of novel in-trons detected at low frequency across samples andwithin an individual. to enable the full spectrum ofintron use to be explored, we have developed intro-verse, which offers an extensive catalogue on thesplicing of 332,571 annotated introns and a linked setof 4,679,474 novel junctions covering 32,669 differ-ent genes. this dataset has been generated throughthe analysis of 17,510 human control rna samplesfrom 54 tissues provided by the genotype-tissue ex-pression consortium. introverse has two unique fea-tures: (i) it provides a complete catalogue of noveljunctions and (ii) each novel junction has been as-signed to a specific annotated intron. this unique,hierarchical structure offers multiple uses, includingthe identification of novel transcripts from knowngenes and their tissue-specific usage, and the as-sessment of background splicing noise for intronsthought to be mis-spliced in disease states. intro-verse provides a user-friendly web interface and isfreely available at https://rytenlab.com/browser/app/introverse",AB_0046
"the european nucleotide archive (ena; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), maintained by the european molecular biology laboratory's european bioinformatics institute (embl-ebi), offers those producing data an open and supported platform for the management, archiving, publication, and dissemination of data; and to the scientific community as a whole, it offers a globally comprehensive data set through a host of data discovery and retrieval tools. here, we describe recent updates to the ena's submission and retrieval services as well as focused efforts to improve connectivity, reusability, and interoperability of ena data and metadata.",AB_0046
"the open targets platform (https://platform.opentargets.org/) is an open source resource to systematically assist drug target identification and prioritisation using publicly available data. since our last update, we have reimagined, redesigned, and rebuilt the platform in order to streamline data integration and harmonisation, expand the ways in which users can explore the data, and improve the user experience. the gene-disease causal evidence has been enhanced and expanded to better capture disease causality across rare, common, and somatic diseases. for target and drug annotations, we have incorporated new features that help assess target safety and tractability, including genetic constraint, protactability assessments, and alphafold structure predictions. we have also introduced new machine learning applications for knowledge extraction from the published literature, clinical trial information, and drug labels. the new technologies and frameworks introduced since the last update will ease the introduction of new features and the creation of separate instances of the platform adapted to user requirements. our new community forum, expanded training materials, and outreach programme support our users in a range of use cases.",AB_0046
"advances in our understanding of the nature of the immune response to sars-cov-2 infection, and how this varies within and between individuals, is important in efforts to develop targeted therapies and precision medicine approaches. here we present a database for the covid-19 multi-omics blood atlas (combat) project, combatdb (https://db.combat.ox.ac.uk). this enables exploration of multi-modal datasets arising from profiling of patients with different severities of illness admitted to hospital in the first phase of the pandemic in the uk prior to vaccination, compared with community cases, healthy controls, and patients with all-cause sepsis and influenza. these data include whole blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, epigenomics, single-cell multi-omics, immune repertoire sequencing, flow and mass cytometry, and cohort metadata. combatdb provides access to the processed data in a well-defined framework of samples, cell types and genes/proteins that allows exploration across the assayed modalities, with functionality including browse, search, download, calculation and visualisation via shiny apps. this advances the ability of users to leverage combat datasets to understand the pathogenesis of covid-19, and the nature of specific and shared features with other infectious diseases.",AB_0046
"it is 24 years since the ipd-imgt/hla database, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ ipd/imgt/hla/, was first released, providing the hla community with a searchable repository of highly curated hla sequences. the database now contains over 35 000 alleles of the human major histocompatibility complex (mhc) named by the who nomenclature committee for factors of the hla system. this complex contains the most polymorphic genes in the human genome and is now considered hyperpolymorphic. the ipd-imgt/hla database provides a stable and user-friendly repository for this information. uptake of next generation sequencing technology in recent years has driven an increase in the number of alleles and the length of sequences submitted. as the size of the database has grown the traditional methods of accessing and presenting this data have been challenged, in response, we have developed a suite of tools providing an enhanced user experience to our traditional web-based users while creating new programmatic access for our bioinformatics user base. this suite of tools is powered by the ipd-api, an application programming interface (api), providing scalable and flexible access to the database. the ipd-api provides a stable platform for our future development allowing us to meet the future challenges of the hla field and needs of the community.",AB_0046
"the gwas central resource gathers and curates extensive summary-level genome-wide association study (gwas) data and puts a range of user-friendly but powerful website tools for the comparison and visualisation of gwas data at the fingertips of researchers. through our continued efforts to harmonise and import data received from gwas authors and consortia, and data sets actively collected from public sources, the database now contains over 72.5 million p-values for over 5000 studies testing over 7.4 million unique genetic markers investigating over 1700 unique phenotypes. here, we describe an update to integrate this extensive data collection with mouse disease model data to support insights into the functional impact of human genetic variation. gwas central has expanded to include mouse gene-phenotype associations observed during mouse gene knockout screens. to allow similar cross-species phenotypes to be compared, terms from mammalian and human phenotype ontologies have been mapped. new interactive interfaces to find, correlate and view human and mouse genotype-phenotype associations are included in the website toolkit. additionally, the integrated browser for interrogating multiple association data sets has been updated and a ga4gh beacon api endpoint has been added for discovering variants tested in gwas. the gwas central resource is accessible at https://www.gwascentral.org/.",AB_0046
"ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org) has produced high-quality genomic resources for vertebrates and model organisms for more than twenty years. during that time, our resources, services and tools have continually evolved in line with both the publicly available genome data and the downstream research and applications that utilise the ensembl platform. in recent years we have witnessed a dramatic shift in the genomic landscape. there has been a large increase in the number of highquality reference genomes through global biodi-versity initiatives. in parallel, there have been major advances towards pangenome representations of higher species, where many alternative genome assemblies representing different breeds, cultivars, strains and haplotypes are now available. in order to support these efforts and accelerate downstream research, it is our goal at ensembl to create highquality annotations, tools and services for species across the tree of life. here, we report our resources for popular reference genomes, the dramatic growth of our annotations (including haplotypes from the first human pangenome graphs), updates to the ensembl variant effect predictor (vep), interactive pro-tein structure predictions from alphafold db, and the beta release of our new website.",AB_0046
