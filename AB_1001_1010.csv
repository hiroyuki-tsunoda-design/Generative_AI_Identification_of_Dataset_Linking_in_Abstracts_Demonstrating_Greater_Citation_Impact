"as for few-shot image classification, recently, some works revisit the standard transfer learning paradigm, i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning, and have achieved some success. however, we find that this kind of methods heavily relies on a naive image-level data augmentation (e.g., cropping and flipping) at the fine-tuning stage, which will easily suffer from the overfitting problem because of the limited-data regime. to tackle this issue, in this paper, we attempt to perform a novel feature-level semantic augmentation at the fine-tuning stage and propose a global- and local-aware feature augmentation method (glfa) from both the channel- and spatial-wise perspectives. in addition, at the pre-training stage, we further propose a semantic orthogonal learning framework (solf) to make the learned feature channels more independently, orthogonal and diverse. extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain significant performance improvements over the state of the arts. code is available at https://github.com/onlyyao/glfa-solf.",AB_0101
"accurate prediction of high-temperature air properties is essential in many aerodynamic applications under hypersonic flight conditions. various curve-fit models using piecewise polynomial fittings have been commonly adopted to approximate equilibrium air properties at high temperatures. several shortcomings including low accuracy, lack of diversity, and discontinuity at curve-fit boundary still remain, causing numerical troubles in computational procedures. to address the issues, idea, an open-source c++ library that enables fast and accurate computations of the equilibrium air properties and their first and second derivatives, is newly developed based on the artificial neural network (ann). idea, which stands for the infinitely differentiable equilibrium air, predicts thermodynamic and transport properties of 11-species (n2, o2, n, o, no, no+, n+, o+, n++, o++, and e-) thermochemical equilibrium air at the temperature range up to 25,000 k and density range from 10-7 to 103 amagats. the training data is constructed from the kinetic molecular theory using the equilibrium constant method with the rigid-rotor, harmonic-oscillator model. as the name suggests, idea's models are infinitely differentiable in the application range; thus, they have enhanced convergence in computational fluid dynamics (cfd) when using gradient-based methods. using a newly developed training process based on the levenberg- marquardt algorithm with weighted mean squared error loss, idea provides more accurate and diverse property models with much fewer parameters than previous piecewise polynomial fitting models. in addition, the proposed training method offers easy extensions to various property models with different species data. idea provides c interfaces that can be used for programs in various computer languages, such as c/c++, fortran, python, and matlab. idea's modeling routines are thread-safe, so they can be safely used for parallel programs without performance loss. the accuracy and enhanced convergence of idea is demonstrated via several high-speed flow computationsprogram summaryprogram title: ideacpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /84rhtfz9n2 .1developers' repository link: https://github .com /hojunyoukr /idea licensing provisions: bsd-3-clauseprogramming language: c++11nature of problem: accurate prediction of equilibrium air properties is essential in many aerodynamic applications under hypersonic flight conditions. direct calculation of air properties by the kinetic molecular theory requires time-consuming iterative methods to solve nonlinear equations of species concentrations. various piecewise polynomial models have been developed to avoid such iterations. however, the regression error of the polynomial models requires improvement, and the lack of diversity of the polynomial models makes iterative computations inevitable, causing computational inefficiency. furthermore, these polynomial models are not continuously differentiable, which deteriorates the convergence characteristics of computational fluid dynamics (cfd) solvers.solution method: ann is chosen to model the equilibrium properties of air owing to its excellent capability as a universal function approximator and better adaptability to a large dataset than kernel methods. the hyperbolic tangent activation function makes the ann model infinitely differentiable, which enables to use a superlinear training process and thus improves convergence characteristics. the newly proposed superlinear training process based on the levenberg-marquardt algorithm with weighted mean squared error loss provides more accurate and diverse property models with much fewer parameters than the existing polynomial models. as a result, the proposed ann model is completely free from iterative computations.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0101
"objective gamma knife surgery (gks) is a well-established treatment for benign intracranial meningiomas; however, the dosimetric factors associated with long-term gks efficacy and safety remain to be elucidated. using data obtained with at least 10 years of follow-up, the authors aimed 1) to analyze gks efficacy and safety for the treatment of benign meningiomas confined to non-skull base, nonperioptic supratentorial locations and 2) to determine the radiation dose window that allows for long-term efficacy and safety, namely the minimum dose to achieve long-term local control (lc) and the maximum safe dose to avoid adverse radiation effects (ares). methods a retrospective analysis was performed on patients who underwent gks for benign meningiomas in the abovementioned location at the authors' institution between 1998 and 2010 and who received follow-up for more than 10 years. the authors meticulously extracted the values of various dosimetric factors by using a dose-volume histogram. cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to investigate the dosimetric factors associated with lc and are.results fifty-five patients (male/female ratio 1:4.2) with 68 tumors were enrolled. the median (range) gross target volume and marginal dose were 4.2 (0.2-31.7) cm3 and 14.3 (9-20) gy, respectively. in total, 23.5% of tumors pro-gressed at an average of 72 months, with 10-and 15-year progression-free survival rates of 80.9% and 73.5%, respec-tively. in univariate analysis, higher marginal dose, coverage (%), dmin, d98%, dmean, d2%, dmax, and paddick conformity index were significantly associated with lc. in multivariate analysis, d98% was the significant factor, with a cutoff value of 11 gy (hr 0.754, p < 0.001). symptomatic ares occurred in 7 patients at an average of 7 months after gks. ares were significantly associated with the volume of normal tissue irradiated with more than 14 gy (nv14gy), with a cutoff value of 0.66 cm3 (hr 2.459, p = 0.002).conclusions d98% was a barometer of the minimum required dose associated with long-term lc, and nv14gy was related to symptomatic ares. the authors recommend a marginal dose ranging from 11 to 14 gy to achieve long-term efficacy and safety in patients with non-skull base, nonperioptic benign supratentorial meningiomas, with the assump- tion of thorough tumor coverage. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.8.jns22422",AB_0101
"in this work, we consider transferring the structure information from large networks to compact ones for dense prediction tasks in computer vision. previous knowledge distillation strategies used for dense prediction tasks often directly borrow the distillation scheme for image classification and perform knowledge distillation for each pixel separately, leading to sub-optimal performance. here we propose to distill structured knowledge from large networks to compact networks, taking into account the fact that dense prediction is a structured prediction problem. specifically, we study two structured distillation schemes: i) pair-wise distillation that distills the pair-wise similarities by building a static graph; and ii) holistic distillation that uses adversarial training to distill holistic knowledge. the effectiveness of our knowledge distillation approaches is demonstrated by experiments on three dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation, depth estimation and object detection. code is available at https://git.io/structkd.",AB_0101
"reported herein is a largely complete mosasaurine mosasaur (squamata: mosasauridae) skeleton from wakayama prefecture, south-western japan. it is represented by many skeletal elements including the skull, a complete cervical and dorsal vertebral series with more than 40 vertebrae, paired ribs, right and left front flippers, and the left hind flipper. the specimen is from near the campanian/maastrichtian boundary (c. 72 ma) within the hasegawa muddy sandstone member of the toyajo formation. we assign the specimen (wmnh-ge-1140240002) to a new genus and species based on a unique combination of characters including: jaw bones gracile; premaxilla-maxilla suture terminating above or just posterior to fourth maxillary tooth; frontal median dorsal ridge robust; frontal alae broadly rounded; frontal descending processes extending parallel to each other; jugal process of postorbitofrontal extending laterally, constituting dorsal half of posterior orbital margin; anterior and posterior carinae on marginal teeth pinched out in cross-section; cervical centra compressed dorsoventrally; zygosphenes and zygantra present at least to the 19th (= posterior) dorsal vertebrae; neural spine orientation changing from procumbent to recumbent along posterior dorsal vertebrae; front and hind flippers longer than mandible; hind flipper longer than front flipper; and hyperphalangy of up to nine. the two sets of large, wing-shaped flippers were likely selected for fast manoeuvring, as seen in the humpback whale among extant mysticetes. the presence of a dorsal fin is suggested by the sweeping arrangement of the neural spines along the dorsal vertebrae, well posterior to the presumed centre of gravity. finally, the pubis and the ilium articulate at an obtuse angle in anteroposterior view, allowing no bony contact between the latter and the axial skeleton.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:e36b7a31-bfca-47b8-9e97-ab249ac9d79b",AB_0101
"video segmentation-partitioning video frames into multiple segments or objects-plays a critical role in a broad range of practical applications, from enhancing visual effects in movie, to understanding scenes in autonomous driving, to creating virtual background in video conferencing. recently, with the renaissance of connectionism in computer vision, there has been an influx of deep learning based approaches for video segmentation that have delivered compelling performance. in this survey, we comprehensively review two basic lines of research - generic object segmentation (of unknown categories) in videos, and video semantic segmentation - by introducing their respective task settings, background concepts, perceived need, development history, and main challenges. we also offer a detailed overview of representative literature on both methods and datasets. we further benchmark the reviewed methods on several well-known datasets. finally, we point out open issues in this field, and suggest opportunities for further research. we also provide a public website to continuously track developments in this fast advancing field: https://github.com/tfzhou/vs-survey.",AB_0101
"the outer core locus (ocl) that includes genes for the synthesis of the variable outer core region of the lipooligosaccharide (los) is one of the key epidemiological markers used for tracing the spread of acinetobacter baumannii, a bacterial pathogen of global concern. in this study, we screened 12 476 publicly available a. baumannii genome assemblies for novel ocl sequences, detecting six new ocl types that were designated ocl17-ocl22. these were compiled with previously characterized ocl sequences to create an updated version of the a. baumannii ocl reference database, providing a total of 22 ocl reference sequences for use with the bioinformatics tool kaptive. use of this database against the 12 476 downloaded assemblies found ocl1 to be the most common locus, present in 73.6 % of sequenced genomes assigned by kaptive with a match confidence score of good or above. ocl1 was most common amongst isolates belonging to sequence types (sts) st1, st2, st3 and st78, all of which are over-represented clonal lineages. the highest level of diversity in ocl types was found in st2, with eight dif-ferent ocls identified. the updated ocl reference database is available for download from github (https://github.com/kleb-genomics/kaptive; under version v. 2.0.5), and has been integrated for use on kaptive-web (https://kaptive-web.erc.monash. edu/) and pathogenwatch (https://pathogen.watch/), enhancing current methods for a. baumannii strain identification, clas-sification and surveillance.",AB_0101
"background: long-term outcomes are unknown in patients with asymptomatic moyamoya disease. in this report, we aimed to clarify their 5-year risk of stroke and its predictors. methods: we are conducting a multicenter, prospective cohort study (asymptomatic moyamoya registry) in japan. participants were eligible if they were 20 to 70 years, had bilateral or unilateral moyamoya disease, experienced no episodes suggestive of tia and stroke; and were functionally independent (modified rankin scale score 0-1). demographic and radiological information was collected at enrollment. in this study, they are still followed up for 10 years. in this interim analysis, we defined the primary end point as a stroke occurring during a 5-year follow-up period. independent predictors for stroke were also determined, using a stratification analysis method. results: between 2012 and 2015, we enrolled 109 patients, of whom 103 patients with 182 involved hemispheres completed the 5-year follow-up. according to the findings on dsa and mra, 143 hemispheres were judged as moyamoya disease and 39 hemispheres as questionable manifestations (isolated middle cerebral artery stenosis). the patients with questionable hemispheres were significantly older, more often male, and more frequently had hypertension than those with moyamoya hemisphere. moyamoya hemispheres developed 7 strokes, including 6 hemorrhagic and 1 ischemic stroke, during the first 5 years. the annual risk of stroke was 1.4% per person, 0.8% per hemisphere, and 1.0% per moyamoya hemisphere. independent predictor for stroke was grade-2 choroidal anastomosis (hazard ratio, 5.05 [95% ci, 1.24-20.6]; p=0.023). furthermore, microbleeds (hazard ratio, 4.89 [95% ci, 1.13-21.3]; p=0.0342) and grade-2 choroidal anastomosis (hazard ratio, 7.05 [95% ci, 1.62-30.7]; p=0.0093) significantly predicted hemorrhagic stroke. no questionable hemispheres developed any stroke. conclusions: the hemispheres with asymptomatic moyamoya disease may carry a 1.0% annual risk of stroke during the first 5 years, the majority of which are hemorrhagic stroke. grade-2 choroidal anastomosis may predict stroke, and the microbleeds and grade-2 choroidal anastomosis may carry the risk for hemorrhagic stroke. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: umin000006640.",AB_0101
"background: approximately 84% of the fatty acids contained in coconut oil (co) are saturated fatty acids (sfas), and approximately 47% of the sfa are lauric acid with 12 carbon atoms. lauric acid carbon chain length is intermediate between medium and long-chain fatty acids (lcfas). we examined how co acts on lipid-related substances in the blood to determine whether its properties were similar to medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas) or lcfas.methods: this is a randomized controlled, single-blind, crossover study. fifteen females were enrolled, using 3 test meals containing 30 g each of 3 different oils: co (co-meal), medium-chain triacylglycerol oil (mct-meal), and long-chain triacylglycerol oil (lct-meal). blood samples were collected at fasted baseline and every 2 h for 8 h after the intake of each test meal.results: repeated measures anova of the ketone bodies and triglyceride (tg) showed an interaction between time and the test meal (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). in subsequent tukey's honestly significant difference (hsd) test of the ketone bodies, statistically significant differences were observed between the co-meal and the lct-meal (p < 0.05) 83.8 (95% ci, 14.7, 153.0) and between the mct-meal and the lct-meal (p < 0.05) 79.2 (95% ci, 10.0, 148.4). the incremental area under the curve (iauc) and maximum increase in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (vldl-c) and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol (idl-c) were the lowest for co-meal intake.conclusions: the characteristics of lauric acid contained in co, including the kinetics of & beta;-oxidation and effects on blood tg, were very similar to those of mcfa. moreover, regarding the iauc and peak increment, vldl-c and idl-c were the lowest with the co-meal. these results suggest that the intake of co after fasting does not increase the tg, vldl-c, and idl-c, and may help prevent dyslipidemia. this trial was registered at umin (url of registration: https://www.umin.ac.jp) as umin000019959.",AB_0101
"background: lateral pelvic lymph node dissection improves oncological outcomes in rectal cancer patients with suspected lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis. however, the indication for this procedure remains unclear. objective: this study aimed to identify the predictive factors for lateral lymph node metastasis and the indications for lateral pelvic lymph node dissection. design: a multi-institutional retrospective study. settings: this study was conducted at 3 university hospitals. patients: this study involved 105 patients with locally advanced mid/low rectal cancer and clinically suspected lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis who underwent total mesorectal excision with lateral pelvic lymph node dissection between 2015 and 2020. main outcome measures: indications were set using lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis-associated preoperative factors. results: among 105 patients, 36 (34.3%) had pathologically confirmed lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis and 77 (73.3%) underwent preoperative chemoradiation. tumors located within 5 cm distance from the anal verge (p = 0.02) and initial node size >= 6 mm (p = 0.001) were significant predictors of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis. the sensitivity was 100% (36/36) with a cutoff of 6 mm for the initial node size and 94.4% (34/36) with a cutoff of 8 mm for the initial node size. when using initial node size cutoffs of 8 mm for anal verge-to-tumor distance of >5 cm and 6 mm for anal verge-to-tumor distance of <= 5 cm, the sensitivity of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis was found to be 100%. limitations: the retrospective design and small sample size were the limitations of this study. conclusion: initial node size and tumor height were significant predictors of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis. this study proposed that an initial node size of >= 8 mm with an anal verge-to-tumor distance of >5 cm and =6 mm with an anal verge-to-tumor distance of <= 5 cm are optimal indications for lateral pelvic lymph node dissection in rectal cancer. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c101.",AB_0101
