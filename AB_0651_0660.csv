"basal cell carcinoma (bcc) of the prostate is a rare tumor. compared with the more common acinar adenocarcinoma (aac) of the prostate, bccs show features of basal cell differentiation and are thought to be biologically distinct from aac. the spectrum of molecular alterations of bcc has not been comprehensively described, and genomic studies are lacking. herein, whole genome sequencing was performed on archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of two cases with bcc. prostatic bccs were characterized by an overall low copy number and mutational burden. recurrent copy number loss of chromosome 16 was observed. in addition, putative driver gene alterations in kit, dennd3, ptpru, mga, and cyld were identified. mechanistically, depletion of the cyld protein resulted in increased proliferation of prostatic basal cells in vitro. collectively, these studies show that prostatic bcc displays distinct genomic alterations from aac and highlight a potential role for loss of chromosome 16 in the pathogenesis of this rare tumor type.

"type 1 diabetes (t1d) outcome prediction plays a vital role in identifying novel risk factors, ensuring early patient care and designing cohort studies. teddy is a longitudinal cohort study that collects a vast amount of multi-omics and clinical data from its participants to explore the progression and markers of t1d. however, missing data in the omics profiles make the outcome prediction a difficult task. teddy collected time series gene expression for less than 6% of enrolled participants. additionally, for the participants whose gene expressions are collected, 79% time steps are missing. this study introduces an advanced bioinformatics framework for gene expression imputation and islet autoimmunity (ia) prediction. the imputation model generates synthetic data for participants with partially or entirely missing gene expression. the prediction model integrates the synthetic gene expression with other risk factors to achieve better predictive performance. comprehensive experiments on teddy datasets show that: (1) our pipeline can effectively integrate synthetic gene expression with family history, hla genotype and snps to better predict ia status at 2 years (sensitivity 0.622, auc 0.715) compared with the individual datasets and state-of-the-art results in the literature (auc 0.682). (2) the synthetic gene expression contains predictive signals as strong as the true gene expression, reducing reliance on expensive and long-term longitudinal data collection. (3) time series gene expression is crucial to the proposed improvement and shows significantly better predictive ability than cross-sectional gene expression. (4) our pipeline is robust to limited data availability. availability: code is available at https:// github.comicompbiolabuct/teddy",AB_0066
"motivation: the positional burrows-wheeler transform (pbwt) has led to tremendous strides in haplotype matching on biobank-scale data. for genetic genealogical search, pbwt-based methods have optimized the asymptotic runtime of finding long matches between a query haplotype and a predefined panel of haplotypes. however, to enable fast query searches, the full-sized panel and pbwt data structures must be kept in memory, preventing existing algorithms from scaling up to modern biobank panels consisting of millions of haplotypes. in this work, we propose a space-efficient variation of pbwt named syllable-pbwt, which divides every haplotype into syllables, builds the pbwt positional prefix arrays on the compressed syllabic panel, and leverages the polynomial rolling hash function for positional substring comparison. with the syllable-pbwt data structures, we then present a long match query algorithm named syllable-query. results: compared to the most time- and space-efficient previously published solution to the long match query problem, syllable-query reduced the memory use by a factor of over 100 on both the uk biobank genotype data and the 1000 genomes project sequence data. surprisingly, the smaller size of our syllabic data structures allows for more efficient iteration and cpu cache usage, granting syllable-query even faster runtime than existing solutions. availability and implementation : https://github.com/zhigroup/syllable-pbwt contact: degui.zhi@uth.tmc.edu or shzhang@cs.ucf.edu supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0066
"molecular dynamics (md) simulation is widely used to study protein conformations and dynamics. however, conventional simulation suffers from being trapped in some local energy minima that are hard to escape. thus, most of the computational time is spent sampling in the already visited regions. this leads to an inefficient sampling process and further hinders the exploration of protein movements in affordable simulation time. the advancement of deep learning provides new opportunities for protein sampling. variational autoencoders are a class of deep learning models to learn a low-dimensional representation (referred to as the latent space) that can capture the key features of the input data. based on this characteristic, we proposed a new adaptive sampling method, latent space-assisted adaptive sampling for protein trajectories (last), to accelerate the exploration of protein conformational space. this method comprises cycles of (i) variational autoencoder training, (ii) seed structure selection on the latent space, and (iii) conformational sampling through additional md simulations. the proposed approach is validated through the sampling of four structures of two protein systems: two metastable states of escherichia coli adenosine kinase (adk) and two native states of vivid (vvd). in all four conformations, seed structures were shown to lie on the boundary of conformation distributions. moreover, large conformational changes were observed in a shorter simulation time when compared with structural dissimilarity sampling (sds) and conventional md (cmd) simulations in both systems. in metastable adk simulations, last explored two transition paths toward two stable states, while sds explored only one and cmd neither. in vvd light state simulations, last was three times faster than cmd simulation with a similar conformational space. overall, last is comparable to sds and is a promising tool in adaptive sampling. the last method is publicly available at https://github.com/smutao-group/last to facilitate related research.",AB_0066
"motivation: gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) is a commonly used algorithm for characterizing gene expression changes. however, the currently available tools used to perform gsea have a limited ability to analyze large datasets, which is particularly problematic for the analysis of single-cell data. to overcome this limitation, we developed a gsea package in python (gseapy), which could efficiently analyze large single-cell datasets. results: we present a package (gseapy) that performs gsea in either the command line or python environment. gseapy uses a rust implementation to enable it to calculate the same enrichment statistic as gsea for a collection of pathways. the rust implementation of gseapy is 3-fold faster than the numpy version of gseapy (v0.10.8) and uses >4-fold less memory. gseapy also provides an interface between python and enrichr web services, as well as for biomart. the enrichr application programming interface enables gseapy to perform over-representation analysis for an input gene list. furthermore, gseapy consists of several tools, each designed to facilitate a particular type of enrichment analysis. availability and implementation: the new gseapy with rust extension is deposited in pypi: https://pypi.org/project/gseapy/. the gseapy source code is freely available at https://github.com/zqfang/gseapy. also, the documentation website is available at https://gseapy.rtfd.io/. contact: gpeltz@stanford.edu supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0066
"effective monitoring and forecasting of urban flooding are crucial for climate change adaptation and resilience around the world. we proposed a novel and automatic system for urban flood detection and quantification. our software takes image/video data of flooding as inputs because the such data source is easy to obtain and widely available compared with conventional water level sensors or flood gauges. first, the kernel of our system is a robust water region segmentation module that detects flooded regions together with surrounding reference objects from the scene. we combine image and video segmentation technologies to make the system reliable under varying weather and illumination conditions. second, our system uses the detected situated objects to determine the inundation depth. field experiments demonstrate that our segmentation results are accurate and reliable; and our system can detect flooding and estimate inundation depths from images and time-lapse videos. our code is available at https://github.com/xmlyqing00/v-floodnet.",AB_0066
"background volitional physical activity level is predictive of a variety of health outcomes, but has not been examined in patients recently hospitalized for acute decompensated hf (adhf).methods ten to 14 days after index hospitalization for adhf, 93 participants wore a wrist-mounted triaxial accelerom-eter (actigraph gt3x +) to objectively quantify sedentary behavior, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. levels were compared to 2 groups of age-matched nhanes participants: healthy and chronic, stable hf. the relationship between physical activity levels and physical function [short physical performance battery (sppb)], hf-specific quality-of-life (qol) [kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaire (kccq)], and cognition [montreal cognitive assessment (moca)] were examined.results adhf participants accumulated a median 1,008 (iqr 896, 1,109) minutes of sedentary time, 88 (57, 139) minutes of light physical activity, and 10 (6, 25) minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day. sedentary time, light physical activity, or moderate-to-vigorous activity did not differ by sex or ef subtype. adhf participants spent only 9% of awake time nonsedentary, compared to 34% and 27% for healthy adults and adults with chronic, stable hf, respectively. among adhf participants, sppb, kccq, and moca scores did not differ among quartiles of total physical activity.conclusions older patients recently hospitalized for adhf have very low levels of physical activity and high levels of sedentary time, both of which may be potential targets for interventions in this high-risk population. physical activity level was not significantly associated with objectively measured physical function, qol, or cognition, suggesting that this measure provides independent information regarding the patient experience of living with hf.trial registration nct02196038, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02196038 (am heart j 2023;256:85-94.)",AB_0066
"open-ended questions in survey research allow participants to respond freely using their own words. because such questions offer the possibility of learning how or why respondents may have achieved a goal or behaved in certain ways, these responses can address some of the inherent limitations of quantitative research, which typically does not allow researchers to understand processes or reasons. but such knowledge-based benefits come at the cost of having to label text data into categories or codes to ease their comparison and reach meaningful understandings. manually classifying open-ended responses is not only time consuming-potentially taking weeks or even months, depending on sample size-but also risks introducing human errors or inconsistencies that can reduce the contribution of these responses in strengthening our understandings. in this study, we discuss the unresolved issue of how to close open-ended responses as rigorously and efficiently as possible relying on machine learning and text classification techniques, without losing context nor the original voices of our research participants, and while leveraging the nuances that human reasoning brings to the qualitative and mixed methods analytic tables. to this end, we offer a rigorous, user-friendly, no-code, and cost-free software appli-cation that implements our mixed equal-status design analytic framework: machine driven classification of open-ended responses (mdcor). to test the performance of mdcor, we analyzed tens of thousands of open-ended responses from two different surveys-one publicly available and one federally-protected. in all instances, mdcor consistently offered time-efficient and reliable results and even tested whether non-response was associated with respondents' attributes. among its multiple outputs, mdcor allows researchers to access the fully classified responses that can then be used in traditional quantitative modeling. since mdcor runs locally, its versatility to handling cross-sectional and longitudinal responses, enables the analysis of a variety of data, from federally protected/restricted sources to the classification of social media posts. by removing manual classification burdens and computer programming expertise, mdcor opens the possibility of efficiently and rigorously reaping the knowledge-based benefits of open-ended responses in survey research without losing or altering our participants' voices. we offer access to the public data analyzed (https://cutt.ly/ynmboal or gonz ' alez canche ', 2022c) and the software (mac version here https://cutt.ly/xv6nnun, windows version https://cutt.ly/lv6ntlg, code ocean version at gonz ' alez canche ' (2022f)) so that researchers can interact first-hand with mdcor and start using this tool and analytic framework in their own studies (see also gonz ' alez canche ', 2022a, 2022b, 2022d, 2022e, for related no-code data science applications to analyze qualitative data dynamically).",AB_0066
"this paper demonstrates how automated machine learning (automl) methods can be used as effective surrogate models in engineering design problems. to do so, we consider the challenging problem of structurally-performant bicycle frame design and demonstrate across-the-board dominance by automl in regression and classification surrogate modeling tasks. we also introduce framed - a parametric dataset of 4500 bicycle frames based on bicycles designed by practitioners and enthusiasts worldwide. accompanying these frame designs, we provide ten structural performance values such as weight, displacements under load, and safety factors computed using finite element simulations for all the bicycle frame designs. we formulate two challenging test problems: a performance-prediction regression problem and a feasibility-prediction classification problem. we then systematically search for optimal surrogate models using bayesian hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search. finally, we show how a state-of-the-art automl method can be effective for both regression and classification problems. we demonstrate that the proposed automl models outperform the strongest gradient boosting and neural network surrogates identified through bayesian optimization by an improved f1 score of 24% for classification and reduced mean absolute error by 12.5% for regression. our work introduces a dataset for bicycle design practitioners, provides two benchmark problems for surrogate modeling researchers, and demonstrates the advantages of automl in machine learning tasks. the dataset and code are provided at http://decode.mit.edu/projects/framed/.

"interpersonal allyship may serve as a justice cue to signal that an environment is fair to women without increasing men's expectations of anti-male bias. we investigated how exposure to justice cues communicated at the interpersonal and organizational level impact men's and women's perceptions of procedural justice and fairness at an organization. men and women were asked to imagine working at one of three randomly assigned male-dominated workplaces. women who imagined working with a white man who was a gender-equality ally (study 1, n = 352, and study 2, n = 488) perceived the organization as more procedurally just, identified more strongly with the organization, and were less likely to view their gender as a disadvantage compared to women who imagined a workplace with an organizational diversity statement (study 2 only) or a control workplace with no justice cues. men did not view the ally nor the diversity statement negatively in either study. integrative data analysis revealed medium to large effects (cohen's d range .74-1.30) across dependent measures included in both studies. our results suggest that interpersonal allyship from men is a practical way to promote women's expectations of fair treatment without increasing the threat of anti-male bias among men. additional online materials for this article are available on pwq's website at http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/03616843221140300.",AB_0066
