"guided image super-resolution (gisr) aims to obtain a high-resolution (hr) target image by enhancing the spatial resolution of a low-resolution (lr) target image under the guidance of a hr image. however, previous model-based methods mainly take the entire image as a whole, and assume the prior distribution between the hr target image and the hr guidance image, simply ignoring many non-local common characteristics between them. to alleviate this issue, we firstly propose a maximum a posteriori (map) estimation model for gisr with two types of priors on the hr target image, i.e., local implicit prior and global implicit prior. the local implicit prior aims to model the complex relationship between the hr target image and the hr guidance image from a local perspective, and the global implicit prior considers the non-local auto-regression property between the two images from a global perspective. secondly, we design a novel alternating optimization algorithm to solve this model for gisr. the algorithm is in a concise framework that facilitates to be replicated into commonly used deep network structures. thirdly, to reduce the information loss across iterative stages, the persistent memory mechanism is introduced to augment the information representation by exploiting the long short-term memory unit (lstm) in the image and feature spaces. in this way, a deep network with certain interpretation and high representation ability is built. extensive experimental results validate the superiority of our method on a variety of gisr tasks, including pan-sharpening, depth image super-resolution, and mr image super-resolution. code will be released at https://github.com/manman1995/pansharpening.",AB_0039
"to enhance the model's flexibility, this study proposes a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (sofnn) modeling methodology based on an adaptive quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (aqpso). first, to address the shortcoming of premature convergence of the qpso algorithm when dealing with complex problems and to acquire the best balance between the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm, a cooperative adaptive adjustment strategy for attractor, coefficient, and boundary is designed. second, to obtain a suitable number of fuzzy rules and optimal premise parameters, the fitness function is constructed using system accuracy (rmse) and network complexity (rule number) in the learning process. simultaneously, an enhanced fuzzy recursive least square (frls) algorithm is designed to estimate the output weights of the fnn to identify the nonlinear dynamical system effectively. furthermore, to ensure that the presented aqpso-sofnn can efficiently solve practical engineering problems, lyapunov stability theory is adopted to prove its convergence in detail. finally, four testing cases, including identification of mackey-glass time series, modeling of concrete compressive strength (ccs), prediction of carbon dioxide, and soft-sensing of effluent total phosphorus (tp), are utilized to verify the usefulness of the proposed aqpso-sofnn-based modeling approach. the simulation results of four testing cases demonstrate that the designed aqpso-sofnn has high prediction accuracy with a parsimonious network topology. the matlab source codes of aqpso-sofnn and other comparison algorithms can be downloaded from https://github.com/hyitzhb/aqpso-sofnn.git.",AB_0039
"the rgb-d salient object detection algorithm simulates human attention behavior and attempts to locate the most visually prominent object(s) from a set of rgb and depth images. existing works often follow a deterministic decoding network, with few methods explicitly considering how to establish connections between features at various levels. to this end, we first propose a cascaded refined rgb-d salient object detection network based on the attention mechanism (crnet), whose primary contribution is a cascaded refined upsampling network layout. specifically, we have developed an adaptive channel transformation ratio alpha in the micro modification module of convolutional block attention (mm), adaptively adjusting the feature channel conversion ratio according to the original input depth feature level to maximize the integration of contextual information during the feature extraction phase. for the multi-modal feature interaction section, we propose a contextual feature aggregation module (a(cf)) consisting of separable convolution, dilated convolution, and adaptive averaging pooling. extend multi-modal fused features' receptive fields, reduce redundant information, and decrease background noise interference. furthermore, we first propose a cascaded refined upsampling network, a precise refining process that includes personal refinement, team expansion, and sequential execution operations. among them, most of the actions were performed in a new sequential refinement module based on attention mechanism (srm-wm). we put the training of crnet under the supervision of a new hybrid loss function. the experiment results show that the structure of our model is simple but very effective and outperforms the 19 sotas on six public datasets using four metrics (similar to 1.6% improvement in f-measure vs. the top-ranked model: bbsnet-tip2021). you can find the code and results of our method at https://github.com/guanyuzong/cr-net.",AB_0039
"code summaries are clear and concise natural language descriptions of program entities. meaningful code summaries assist developers in better understanding. code summarization refers to the task of generating a natural language summary from a code snippet. most researches on code summarization focus on automatically generating summaries for methods or functions. however, in an object-oriented language such as java, class is the basic programming unit rather than method. to fill this gap, in this paper, we investigate how to generate summaries for java classes utilizing deep learning-based approaches. we propose a novel encoder-decoder model called classsum to generate functionality descriptions for java classes and build a dataset containing 172,639 <class, summary> pairs from 3185 repositories hosted on github. since the code of class is much longer and more complicated, encoding a whole class via neural network is more challenging than encoding a method. on the other hand, the content within a class may be incomplete. to overcome this difficulty, we reduce the code of a class by only keeping its key elements, namely class signatures, method signatures and attribute names. to utilize both lexical and structural information of code, our model takes token sequence and abstract syntax tree of the reduced class content as inputs. classsum and five baselines (designed for method-level code summarization) are evaluated on our dataset. experiment results show that summaries generated by classsum are more accurate and readable than those generated by baselines. our dataset is available at https://github.com/classsum/classsum.",AB_0039
"image rescaling is a commonly used bidirectional operation, which first downscales high-resolution images to fit various display screens or to be storage- and bandwidth-friendly, and afterward upscales the corresponding low-resolution images to recover the original resolution or the details in the zoom-in images. however, the non-injective downscaling mapping discards high-frequency contents, leading to the ill-posed problem for the inverse restoration task. this can be abstracted as a general image degradation-restoration problem with information loss. in this work, we propose a novel invertible framework to handle this general problem, which models the bidirectional degradation and restoration from a new perspective, i.e. invertible bijective transformation. the invertibility enables the framework to model the information loss of pre-degradation in the form of distribution, which could mitigate the ill-posed problem during post-restoration. to be specific, we develop invertible models to generate valid degraded images and meanwhile transform the distribution of lost contents to the fixed distribution of a latent variable during the forward degradation. then restoration is made tractable by applying the inverse transformation on the generated degraded image together with a randomly-drawn latent variable. we start from image rescaling and instantiate the model as invertible rescaling network, which can be easily extended to the similar decolorization-colorization task. we further propose to combine the invertible framework with existing degradation methods such as image compression for wider applications. experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of our model over existing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of upscaling and colorizing reconstruction from downscaled and decolorized images, and rate-distortion of image compression. code is available at https:// github.com/pkuxmq/invertible-image-rescaling.",AB_0039
"3d shape analysis has drawn broad attention due to its increasing demands in various fields. despite that impressive performance has been achieved on several databases, most researchers focus their ef-forts on improving the performance of shape classification, retrieval, segmentation, etc. they neglect the fact that the disturbances, such as orientation and deformation, may impact much on the perception, restricting the capacity of generalizing to real applications where the prior of orientation and pose is of-ten unknown. in this paper, we conduct shape analysis on point clouds and propose the point projection feature, which is rotation-invariant. specifically, a novel architecture is designed to mine features of dif-ferent levels. we adopt a pointnet-based backbone to extract global feature for the point cloud, and the graph aggregation operation to perceive local pose variance in the euclidean space or geodesic space. an efficient key point descriptor is designed to assign each point with different response and help recognize the overall geometry. furthermore, a novel dataset, pkunon-rigid, is built that is composed of non-rigid 3d objects, based on which we evaluate the capacity of several mainstream methods in terms of pro-cessing non-rigid shapes. mathematical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract isometry-invariant representations for 3d shape analysis tasks without rotation aug-mentation, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. the proposed dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/tasx0823/pkunon-rigid.(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0039
"deep convolutional neural networks (cnns) are used for image denoising via automatically mining ac-curate structure information. however, most of existing cnns depend on enlarging depth of designed networks to obtain better denoising performance, which may cause training difficulty. in this paper, we propose a multi-stage image denoising cnn with the wavelet transform (mwdcnn) via three stages, i.e., a dynamic convolutional block (dcb), two cascaded wavelet transform and enhancement blocks (webs) and a residual block (rb). dcb uses a dynamic convolution to dynamically adjust parameters of several convolutions for making a tradeoff between denoising performance and computational costs. web uses a combination of signal processing technique (i.e., wavelet transformation) and discriminative learning to suppress noise for recovering more detailed information in image denoising. to further remove redundant features, rb is used to refine obtained features for improving denoising effects and reconstruct clean im-ages via improved residual dense architectures. experimental results show that the proposed mwdcnn outperforms some popular denoising methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis. codes are available at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/mwdcnn.(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0039
"due to dnns' memorization effect, label noise lessens the performance of the web-supervised fine-grained visual categorization task. previous literature primarily relies on small-loss instances for sub-sequent training. the current state-of-the-art approach jocor additionally employs explicit consistency constraints to make clean samples more confident. however, a joint loss designed for both sample selec-tion criteria and parameter updating is not competent for training a robust model in the presence of web noise. especially, false positives are assigned with larger weights, causing the model to pay more attention to misclassified noisy images. besides, leveraging weight decay to forget discarded noisy instances is too slow and implicit to take effect. therefore, we propose a simple yet effective approach named ms-dejor (multi-scale training with decoupled joint optimization and refurbishment). in contrast to jocor, we decouple sample selection from training procedure to handle the above problems. specifically, a negative entropy term is applied to prevent false positives from being overemphasized. the model can explicitly forget those samples identified as noise by imposing such a regularization term on all training data. fur-thermore, we use accumulated predictions to refurbish the noisy labels and re-weight training images to boost the model performance. a multi-scale feature enhancement module is adopted to extract discrimi-native and subtle feature representations. extensive experiments show that ms-dejor yields state-of-the-art performances on three web-supervised fine-grained datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. the data and source code have been available at https://github.com/msdejor/ms-dejor .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0039
"ancient murals, suffering from severe diseases, usually exhibit the absence or distortion of local areas. the damaged murals severely impaired people's visual appreciation and satisfaction in the digital conservation of cultural heritage. however, there is no large amount of murals due to their scarcity. in this paper, we propose a novel content-constrained convolutional network for mural image completion. this method employs frequency transformation to facilitate effective multi-scale feature fusion for image inpainting, taking into account both space and frequency domains. our network uses adaptive space-varying activation functions to correct feature maps across scales. our network also uses dual-domain partial convolution with a mask for computing on only valid points, whereas the mask is updated for the next layer. this iterative process is performed until the mask is filled to build the repaired image. the proposed method is verified on the datasets in comparison with baseline methods. the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better results with less artifacts in repairing mural images and generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. the code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zhangyongqin/c3n.",AB_0039
"noisy labels composed of correct and corrupted ones are pervasive in practice. they might significantly deteriorate the performance of convolutional neural networks (cnns), because cnns are easily overfit-ted on corrupted labels. to address this issue, inspired by an observation, deep neural networks might first memorize the probably correct-label data and then corrupt-label samples, we propose a novel yet simple self-paced resistance framework to resist corrupted labels, without using any clean valida-tion data. the proposed framework first utilizes the memorization effect of cnns to learn a curricu-lum, which contains confident samples and provides meaningful supervision for other training samples. then it adopts selected confident samples and a proposed resistance loss to update model parameters; the resistance loss tends to smooth model parameters' update or attain equivalent prediction over each class, thereby resisting model overfitting on corrupted labels. finally, we unify these two modules into a single loss function and optimize it in an alternative learning. extensive experiments demonstrate the significantly superior performance of the proposed framework over recent state-of-the-art methods on noisy-label data. source codes of the proposed method are available on https://github.com/xsshi2015/ self- paced- resistance-learning .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0039
