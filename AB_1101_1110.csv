"lysine 2-hydroxyisobutylation (k-hib), which was first reported in 2014, has been shown to play vital roles in a myriad of biological processes including gene transcription, regulation of chromatin functions, purine metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. identification of k-hib sites in protein substrates represents an initial but crucial step in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying protein 2-hydroxyisobutylation. experimental identification of k-hib sites mainly depends on the combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. however, experimental approaches for identifying k-hib sites are often time-consuming and expensive compared with computational approaches. previous studies have shown that k-hib sites may have distinct characteristics for different cell types of the same species. several tools have been developed to identify k-hib sites, which exhibit high diversity in their algorithms, encoding schemes and feature selection techniques. however, to date, there are no tools designed for predicting cell type-specific k-hib sites. therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an effective predictor for cell type-specific k-hib site prediction. inspired by the residual connection of resnet, we develop a deep learning-based approach, termed resnetkhib, which leverages both the one-dimensional convolution and transfer learning to enable and improve the prediction of cell type-specific 2-hydroxyisobutylation sites. resnetkhib is capable of predicting k-hib sites for four human cell types, mouse liver cell and three rice cell types. its performance is benchmarked against the commonly used random forest (rf) predictor on both 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests. the results show that resnetkhib achieves the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values ranging from 0.807 to 0.901, depending on the cell type and species, which performs better than rf-based predictors and other currently available k-hib site prediction tools. we also implement an online web server of the proposed resnetkhib algorithm together with all the curated datasets and trained model for the wider research community to use, which is publicly accessible at https://resnetkhib.erc.monash.edu/.",AB_0111
"recently, cyclic peptides have been considered breakthrough drugs because they can interact with undruggable targets such as intracellular protein-protein interactions. mem-brane permeability is an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting, and the development of membrane-permeable peptides is a bottleneck in cyclic peptide drug discovery. although many experimental data on membrane permeability of cyclic peptides have been reported, a comprehensive database is not yet available. a comprehensive membrane permeability database is essential for developing computational methods for cyclic peptide drug design. in this study, we constructed cycpeptmpdb, the first web-accessible database of cyclic peptide membrane permeability. we collected information on a total of 7334 cyclic peptides, including the structure and experimentally measured membrane permeability, from 45 published papers and 2 patents from pharmaceutical companies. to unambiguously represent cyclic peptides larger than small molecules, we used the hierarchical editing language for macromolecules notation to generate a uniform sequence representation of peptides. in addition to data storage, cycpeptmpdb provides several supporting functions such as online data visualization, data analysis, and downloading. cycpeptmpdb is expected to be a valuable platform to support membrane permeability research on cyclic peptides. cycpeptmpdb can be freely accessed at http://cycpeptmpdb.com.

"background: the usefulness of preoperative measurement of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (lvgls) for predicting prognosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery has not been evaluated. we analyzed the prognostic value of lvgls in predicting postoperative 30-day cardiovascular events and myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (mins). methods: this prospective cohort study was conducted in two referral hospitals and included 871 patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery <1 month after preoperative echocardiography. those with ejection fraction <40%, valvular heart disease, and regional wall motion abnormality were excluded. the co-primary endpoints were the (1) composite incidence of all-cause death, acute coronary syndrome (acs), and mins and (2) com-posite incidence of all-cause death and acs. results: among the 871 participants enrolled (mean age: 72.9 years; female: 60.8%), there were 43 cases of the primary endpoint (4.9%): 10 deaths, 3 acs, and 37 mins. participants with impaired lvgls (<= 16.6%) had a higher incidence of the co-primary endpoints (log-rank p < 0.001 and 0.015) than those without. the result was similar after adjustment with clinical variables and preoperative troponin t levels (hazard ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.03-1.65; p = 0.027). in sequential cox analysis and net reclassification index, lvgls had an incremental value for predicting the co-primary endpoints after non-cardiac surgery. among the 538 (61.8%) participants who underwent serial troponin assay, lvgls predicted mins independently from the traditional risk factors (odds ratio = 3.54, 95% ci = 1.70-7.36; p = 0.001). conclusions: preoperative lvgls has an independent and incremental prognostic value in predicting early postoperative cardiovascular events and mins. clinical trial registration: url: https://trialsearch.who.int/. unique identifiers: kct0005147.",AB_0111
"background remimazolam is a new anesthetic drug developed and is an ultra-short-acting agent with rapid onset and offset. the pharmacology of this drug seems to be ideal for short surgeries eligible for i-gel insertion. therefore, this study aimed to determine the optimal bolus dose of remimazolam for i-gel insertion when co-administered with remifentanil without neuromuscular blocking agents (nmbas). methods patients aged 19-65 years with american society of anesthesiologists physical status i or ii scheduled for general anesthesia were enrolled. the first dose of remimazolam was 0.15 mg/kg and remifentanil was co-administered at an effect-site concentration (ce) of 3.0 ng/ml. the dose of remimazolam for the following patient was decreased or increased by 0.05 mg/kg depending on the success or failure of i-gel insertion in the previous patient. results the remimazolam bolus dose required for successful i-gel insertion in 50% of adult patients using modified dixon's up-and-down method with remifentanil ce 3.0 ng/ml and no nmbas was 0.280 +/- 0.048 mg/kg. isotonic regression analysis showed that the 50% and 95% effective doses were 0.244 (83% confidence interval [ci] 0.2130.313) mg/kg and 0.444 (95% ci 0.436-0.448) mg/kg, respectively. the mean time to loss of consciousness (modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation score < 2) was 52.2 s. three patients (12.0%) showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure of more than 30% from baseline. conclusions selecting the appropriate dose of remimazolam/remifentanil without nmbas makes it feasible to insert the i-gel. trial registration this study protocol was registered at http://cris.nih.go.kr (kct0007801, 12th, october, 2022). trial registration this study protocol was registered at http://cris.nih.go.kr (kct0007801, 12th, october, 2022).",AB_0111
"pathways are composed of proteins forming a network to represent specific biological mechanisms and are often used to measure enrichment scores based on a list of genes in means to measure their biological activity. the pathway analysis is a de facto standard downstream analysis procedure in most genomic and transcriptomic studies. here, we present mopa (multi-omics pathway analysis), which is a multi-omics integrative method that scores individual pathways in a sample wise manner in terms of enriched multi-omics regulatory activity, which we refer to mes (multi-omics enrichment score). the mes score reflects the strength of regulatory relations between multi-omics in units of pathways. in addition, mopa is able to measure how much each omics contribute to mes that may be used to observe what kind of omics are active in a pathway within a sample group (e.g., subtype, gender), which we refer to ocr (omics contribution rate). using nine different cancer types, 93 clinical features and three types of omics (i.e., gene expression, mirna and methylation), mopa was used to search for clinical features that were explainable in context of multi-omics. by evaluating the performance of mopa, we showed that it yielded higher or at least equal performance compared to previous single and multi-omics pathway analysis tools. we find that the advantage of mopa is the ability to explain pathways in terms of omics relation using mes and ocr. as one of the results, the tgf-beta signaling pathway was captured as an important pathway that showed distinct mes and ocr values specific to the cms4 subtype in colon adenocarcinoma. the mes and ocr metrics suggested that the mrna and mirna expressions were significantly different from the other subtypes, which was concordant with previous studies. the mopa software is available at https://github.com/jaeminjj/mopa.",AB_0111
"optical satellite imagery is an important earth observation data source, yet when clouds are present, they provide limited utility for land surface applications. synthetic aperture radar (sar)-optical data fusion models predict the missing reflectance values through the correlation between optical images and cloud-insensitive sar images often using deep learning to train the model. however, most existing sar-optical data fusion methods did not incorporate temporal correlation optimally as they were not trained on dense and localized time-series data. herein, we develop a new sar-optical data fusion method that incorporated spatial, temporal, and crossdata-source correlation in the same framework. the method uses spatio-temporal (st) partitioning and pixelwise multiple linear regression (mlr) and is named st-mlr. the parsimonious structure of st-mlr provides training-efficient model development, enabling the incorporation of full spatio-temporal information for a specific site. st-mlr was validated with ndvi as the target in seven sites across a wide range of environments and landcovers. both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated the potential of st-mlr to reproduce the target variable accurately with respect to both spatial and temporal dynamics. although st-mlr had relatively less accuracy when reconstructing multi-band images than when reconstructing the ndvi, its results were comparable to existing reconstruction methods in this regard. compared with traditional optical image reconstruction methods and deep learning sar-optical fusion methods, st-mlr is a simple, fast and reasonably accurate model, especially when filling large spatial gaps. st-mlr is accessible to anyone regardless of compute capability as it can be implemented on google earth engine - a public cloud computing platform. st-mlr can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of more complicated models such as those based on deep learning. the st-mlr code is publicly available at https://github.com/yongjingmao/sar-opt_fusion_gee.",AB_0111
"objective: the role of combined ffr/cfr measurements in decision-making on coronary revascularization re-mains unclear. define-flow prospectively assessed the relationship of ffr/cfr agreement with 2-year major adverse cardiac event (mace) and target vessel failure (tvf) rates, and uniquely included core-laboratory analysis of all pressure and flow tracings. we aimed to document the impact of core-laboratory analysis on lesion classification, and the relationship between core-laboratory fractional flow reserve (ffr) and coronary flow reserve (cfr) values with clinical outcomes and angina burden during follow-up. methods: in 398 vessels (348 patients) considered for intervention, >= 1 coronary pressure/flow tracing was approved by the core-laboratory. revascularization was performed only when both ffr(<= 0.80) and cfr(<2.0) were abnormal, all others were treated medically. results: mace was lowest for concordant normal ffr/cfr, but was not significantly different compared with either discordant group (low ffr/normal cfr: hr:1.63; 95%ci:0.61-4.40; p = 0.33; normal ffr/low cfr: hr:1.81; 95%ci:0.66-4.98; p = 0.25). moreover, mace did not differ between discordant groups treated medically and the concordant abnormal group undergoing revascularization (normal ffr/low cfr: hr:0.63; 95%ci:0.23-1.73;p = 0.37; normal ffr/low cfr: hr:0.70; 95%ci:0.22-2.21;p = 0.54). similar findings applied to tvf. conclusions: patients with concordantly normal ffr/cfr have very low 2-year mace and tvf rates. throughout follow-up, there were no differences in event rates between patients in whom revascularization was deferred due to preserved cfr despite reduced ffr, and those in whom pci was performed due to concordantly low ffr and cfr. these findings question the need for routine revascularization in vessels showing low ffr but preserved cfr. clinical trial registration: http://clinicaltrials.gov nct02328820",AB_0111
"diffuse midline gliomas (dmg) harbouring h3k27m mutation are paediatric tumours with a dismal outcome. recently, a new subtype of midline gliomas has been described with similar features to dmg, including loss of h3k27 trimethylation, but lacking the canonical h3k27m mutation (h3-wt). here, we report a cohort of five h3-wt tumours profiled by whole-genome sequencing, rna sequencing and dna methylation profiling and combine their analysis with previously published cases. we show that these tumours have recurrent and mutually exclusive mutations in either acvr1 or egfr and are characterised by high expression of ezhip associated to its promoter hypomethylation. affected patients share a similar poor prognosis as patients with h3k27m dmg. global molecular analysis of h3-wt and h3k27m dmg reveal distinct transcriptome and methylome profiles including differential methylation of homeobox genes involved in development and cellular differentiation. patients have distinct clinical features, with a trend demonstrating acvr1 mutations occurring in h3-wt tumours at an older age. this in-depth exploration of h3-wt tumours further characterises this novel dmg, h3k27-altered sub-group, characterised by a specific immunohistochemistry profile with h3k27me3 loss, wild-type h3k27m and positive ezhip. it also gives new insights into the possible mechanism and pathway regulation in these tumours, potentially opening new therapeutic avenues for these tumours which have no known effective treatment. this study has been retrospectively registered on clinicaltrial.gov on 8 november 2017 under the registration number nct03336931 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03336931).",AB_0111
"the biocreative national library of medicine (nlm)-chem track calls for a community effort to fine-tune automated recognition of chemical names in the biomedical literature. chemicals are one of the most searched biomedical entities in pubmed, and-as highlighted during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-their identification may significantly advance research in multiple biomedical subfields. while previous community challenges focused on identifying chemical names mentioned in titles and abstracts, the full text contains valuable additional detail. we, therefore, organized the biocreative nlm-chem track as a community effort to address automated chemical entity recognition in full-text articles. the track consisted of two tasks: (i) chemical identification and (ii) chemical indexing. the chemical identification task required predicting all chemicals mentioned in recently published full-text articles, both span [i.e. named entity recognition (ner)] and normalization (i.e. entity linking), using medical subject headings (mesh). the chemical indexing task required identifying which chemicals reflect topics for each article and should therefore appear in the listing of mesh terms for the document in the medline article indexing. this manuscript summarizes the biocreative nlm-chem track and post-challenge experiments. we received a total of 85 submissions from 17 teams worldwide. the highest performance achieved for the chemical identification task was 0.8672 f-score (0.8759 precision and 0.8587 recall) for strict ner performance and 0.8136 f-score (0.8621 precision and 0.7702 recall) for strict normalization performance. the highest performance achieved for the chemical indexing task was 0.6073 f-score (0.7417 precision and 0.5141 recall). this community challenge demonstrated that (i) the current substantial achievements in deep learning technologies can be utilized to improve automated prediction accuracy further and (ii) the chemical indexing task is substantially more challenging. we look forward to further developing biomedical text-mining methods to respond to the rapid growth of biomedical literature. the nlm-chem track dataset and other challenge materials are publicly available at https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/bc7-nlm-chem-track/.",AB_0111
"deep convolutional neural networks have been highly effective in segmentation tasks. however, segmentation becomes more difficult when training images include many complex instances to segment, such as the task of nuclei segmentation in histopathology images. weakly supervised learning can reduce the need for large-scale, high-quality ground truth annotations by involving non-expert annotators or algorithms to generate supervision information for segmentation. however, there is still a significant performance gap between weakly supervised learning and fully supervised learning approaches. in this work, we propose a weakly-supervised nuclei segmentation method in a two-stage training manner that only requires annotation of the nuclear centroids. first, we generate boundary and superpixel-based masks as pseudo ground truth labels to train our sac-net, which is a segmentation network enhanced by a constraint network and an attention network to effectively address the problems caused by noisy labels. then, we refine the pseudo labels at the pixel level based on confident learning to train the network again. our method shows highly competitive performance of cell nuclei segmentation in histopathology images on three public datasets. code will be available at: https://github.com/ruoyuguo/maskga_net.",AB_0111
