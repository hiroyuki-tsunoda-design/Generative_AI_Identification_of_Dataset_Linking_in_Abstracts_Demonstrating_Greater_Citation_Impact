"graph-regularized non-negative matrix factorization (gnmf) is proved to be effective for the clustering of nonlinear separable data. existing gnmf variants commonly improve model performance by adding different additional constraints or refining the model factorization form, which can lead to problems such as increased algorithm complexity or insufficient performance release. in this paper, we propose semi-supervised non -negative matrix tri-factorization with adaptive neighbors and block-diagonal (abnmtf). different from existing methods, in abnmtf the similarity graph matrix is learned from the original data by adaptive neighbors k -nearest model, and a block diagonal matrix is constructed based on a few labeled data to update the similarity matrix. our approach reconstructs the block diagonal structure into the adaptive similarity matrix, which enables simultaneous learning of the similarity matrix and label binding during factorization, engendering a distinguishable subspace representation matrix and therefore improving the clustering performance without significantly increasing the complexity of the algorithm. we also represent an optimization method to solve the abnmtf and provide analyses of convergence and computational complexity. extensive experiments on 8 real image datasets show that the proposed algorithm reports superior performance against several state-of-the-art approaches. code has been made available at: https://github.com/lstinwh/abnmtf.",AB_0189
"automatic segmentation of skin lesions is crucial for diagnosing and treating skin diseases. although current medical image segmentation methods have significantly improved the results of skin lesion segmentation, the following major challenges still affect the segmentation performance: (i) segmentation targets have irregular shapes and diverse sizes and (ii) low contrast or blurred boundaries between lesions and background. to address these issues, this study proposes a gated fusion attention network (gfanet) which designs two progressive relation decoders to accurately segment skin lesions images. first, we use a context features gated fusion decoder (cgfd) to fuse multiple levels of contextual features, and then a prediction result is generated as the initial guide map. then, it is optimized by a prediction decoder consisting of a shape flow and a final gated convolution fusion (gcf) module, where we iteratively use a set of channel reverse attention (cra) modules and gcf modules in the shape flow to combine the features of the current layer and the prediction results of the adjacent next layer to gradually extract boundary information. finally, to speed up network convergence and improve segmentation accuracy, we use gcf to fuse low-level features from the encoder and the final output of the shape flow. to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed gfanet, we conduct extensive ex-periments on four publicly available skin lesion datasets (international skin imaging collaboration [isic] 2016, isic 2017, isic 2018, and ph2) and compare them with state-of-the-art methods. the experimental results show that the proposed gfanet achieves excellent segmentation performance in commonly used evaluation metrics, and the segmentation results are stable. the source code is available at https://github.com/shihanq/gfanet.",AB_0189
"traffic flow prediction remains an ongoing hot topic in the field of intelligent transportation system. the state-of-the-art traffic flow prediction models can effectively extract both spatial and temporal features of traffic flow data, but ignore the correlation and external interference between traffic nodes. to this end, this paper proposes a novel method based on spatial-temporal complex graph convolution network (st-cgcn) for traffic flow prediction. specifically, we first constructs the distance matrix, the data correlation matrix, and the comfort measurement matrix according to the geographical locations, the historical data record, and the external interference between traffic nodes. then, these three matrices are fused into a complex correlation matrix by introducing self-learning dynamic weights to improve the joint modeling ability of spatial-temporal features and external factors. next, a spatial feature extraction module and a temporal feature extraction module are designed to characterize dynamic spatial-temporal features. the spatial feature extraction module consists of a graph convolution operator with a proposed complex correlation matrix and a residual unit. the temporal feature extraction module consists of a 3d convolution operator and a long short-term memory (lstm). experiments constructed on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the new proposed st-cgcn is more effective than several existing deep learning based traffic flow prediction models. the key source code and data are available at https://github.com/bounger2/st-cgcn.",AB_0189
"recent works on 3d single object tracking treat the task as a target-specific 3d detection task, where an off the-shelf 3d detector is commonly employed for the tracking. however, it is non-trivial to perform accurate target-specific detection since the point cloud of objects in raw lidar scans is usually sparse and incomplete. in this paper, we address this issue by explicitly leveraging temporal motion cues and propose dmt, a detector-free motion-prediction-based 3d tracking network that completely removes the usage of complicated 3d detectors and is lighter, faster, and more accurate than previous trackers. specifically, the motion prediction module is first introduced to estimate a potential target center of the current frame in a point-cloud-free manner. then, an explicit voting module is proposed to directly regress the 3d box from the estimated target center. extensive experiments on kitti and nuscenes datasets demonstrate that our dmt can still achieve better performance (similar to 10% improvement over the nuscenes dataset) and a faster tracking speed (i.e., 72 fps) than state-of-the-art approaches without applying any complicated 3d detectors. our code is released at https://github.com/jimmy-dq/dmt.",AB_0189
"a sequential recommendation has become a hot research topic, which seeks to predict the next interesting item for each user based on his action sequence. while previous methods have made many efforts to capture the dynamics of sequential patterns, we contend that they still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) they fail to model item transition patterns in an efficient and time-sensitive manner and 2) they are unaware of the importance of dynamically capturing social influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. we introduce a new concept dubbed socio-sequential recommendation, where the challenge mainly lies in dynamically modeling social influences and capturing item-to-item transition patterns in a time-sensitive manner. in light of this, we contribute a novel solution named gcarec (short for graph-augmented co-attention model), which takes into account the joint effect of dynamic sequential patterns and dynamic social influences. gcarec decomposes socio-sequential recommendation workflow into two steps. first, we adopt a light graph embedding module to model long-term user preference. then, we propose a time-sensitive attention mechanism and a social-aware attention mechanism to capture dynamic patterns at sequential-level and social-level, respectively. extensive experiments have been conducted on eight real-world datasets from different scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of gcarec against several state-of-the-art methods. the codes and datasets have been released at: https://github.com/wubinzzu/gcarec.",AB_0189
"ultrasound segmentation of thyroid nodules is a challenging task, which plays an vital role in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. however, the following two factors limit the development of automatic thyroid nodule segmentation algorithms: (1) existing automatic nodule segmentation algorithms that directly apply semantic segmentation techniques can easily mistake non-thyroid areas as nodules, because of the lack of the thyroid gland region perception, the large number of similar areas in the ultrasonic images, and the inherently low contrast images; (2) the currently available dataset (i.e., ddti) is small and collected from a single center, which violates the fact that thyroid ultrasound images are acquired from various devices in real-world situations. to overcome the lack of thyroid gland region prior knowledge, we design a thyroid region prior guided feature enhancement network (trfe+) for accurate thyroid nodule segmentation. specifically, (1) a novel multi-task learning framework that simultaneously learns the nodule size, gland position, and the nodule position is designed; (2) an adaptive gland region feature enhancement module is proposed to make full use of the thyroid gland prior knowledge; (3) a normalization approach with respect to the channel dimension is applied to alleviate the domain gap during the training process. to facilitate the development of thyroid nodule segmentation, we have contributed tn3k: an open-access dataset containing 3493 thyroid nodule images with high-quality nodule masks labeling from various devices and views. we perform a thorough evaluation based on the tn3k test set and ddti to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. code and data are available at https://github.com/haifangong/trfe-net-for-thyroid-nodule-segmentation.",AB_0189
"drug-drug interactions (ddis) are a major concern in clinical practice and have been recognized as one of the key threats to public health. to address such a critical threat, many studies have been conducted to clarify the mechanism underlying each ddi, based on which alternative therapeutic strategies are successfully proposed. moreover, artificial intelligence-based models for predicting ddis, especially multilabel classification models, are highly dependent on a reliable ddi data set with clear mechanistic information. these successes highlight the imminent necessity to have a platform providing mechanistic clarifications for a large number of existing ddis. however, no such platform is available yet. in this study, a platform entitled mecddi was therefore introduced to systematically clarify the mechanisms underlying the existing ddis. this platform is unique in (a) clarifying the mechanisms underlying over 1,78,000 ddis by explicit descriptions and graphic illustrations and (b) providing a systematic classification for all collected ddis based on the clarified mechanisms. due to the long-lasting threats of ddis to public health, mecddi could offer medical scientists a clear clarification of ddi mechanisms, support healthcare professionals to identify alternative therapeutics, and prepare data for algorithm scientists to predict new ddis. mecddi is now expected as an indispensable complement to the available pharmaceutical platforms and is freely accessible at: https://idrblab. org/mecddi/.",AB_0189
"deep neural networks (dnns) have powerful learning abilities on high-rank and non-linear features, and thus have been applied to various fields, exhibiting higher discrimination performance than conventional methods. however, their applications in enterprise credit rating tasks are rare, as most dnns employ the end-to-endlearning paradigm, producing high-rank representations of objects or predictive results without any explanations. this black boxapproach makes it difficult for users in the financial industry to understand how these predictive results are generated, or what correlations exist with the raw inputs, leading to a lack of trust to the predictions. to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel network to explicitly model the enterprise credit rating problem using dnns and attention mechanisms, allowing for explainable enterprise credit ratings. experiments conducted on real-world enterprise datasets show that the proposed approach achieves higher performance than conventional methods, while also providing insights into individual rating results and the reliability of model training. the code is provided on https://github.com/weyne168/creditratting.",AB_0189
"background mass vaccination has dramatically reduced the incidence of severe covid-19, with most cases now presenting as self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. however, those with co-morbidities, the elderly and immunocompromised, as well as the unvaccinated, remain disproportionately vulnerable to severe covid-19 and its sequelae. furthermore, as the effectiveness of vaccination wanes with time, immune escape sars-cov-2 variants could emerge to cause severe covid-19. reliable prognostic biomarkers for severe disease could be used as early indicator of re-emergence of severe covid-19 as well as for triaging of patients for antiviral therapy. methods we performed a systematic review and re-analysis of 7 publicly available datasets, analysing a total of 140 severe and 181 mild covid-19 patients, to determine the most consistent differentially regulated genes in peripheral blood of severe covid-19 patients. in addition, we included an independent cohort where blood transcriptomics of covid-19 patients were prospectively and longitudinally monitored previously, to track the time in which these gene expression changes occur before nadir of respiratory function. single cell rna -sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from publicly available datasets was then used to determine the immune cell subsets involved.findings the most consistent differentially regulated genes in peripheral blood of severe covid-19 patients were mcemp1, hla-dra and ets1 across the 7 transcriptomics datasets. moreover, we found significantly heightened mcemp1 and reduced hla-dra expression as early as four days before the nadir of respiratory function, and the differential expression of mcemp1 and hla-dra occurred predominantly in cd14+ cells. the online platform which we developed is publicly available at https://kuanrongchan-covid19-severity-app-t7l38g. streamlitapp.com/, for users to query gene expression differences between severe and mild covid-19 patients in these datasets.interpretation elevated mcemp1 and reduced hla-dra gene expression in cd14+ cells during the early phase of disease are prognostic of severe covid-19.funding k.r.c is funded by the national medical research council (nmrc) of singapore under the open fund individual research grant (moh-000610). e.e.o. is funded by the nmrc senior clinician-scientist award (moh -000135-00). j.g.h.l. is funded by the nmrc under the clinician-scientist award (nmrc/csainv/013/2016-01). s.k. is funded by the nmrc under the transition award. this study was sponsored in part by a generous gift from the hour glass. copyright (c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license (). 2023;89: published  1016/j.ebiom.2023. 104472",AB_0189
"natural products (nps) have long been associated with human production and play a key role in the survival of species. significant variations in np content may severely affect the return on investment of np-based industries and render ecological systems vulnerable. thus, it is crucial to construct a platform that relates variations in np content to their corresponding mechanisms. in this study, a publicly accessible online platform, npcvar (http://npcvar.idrblab.net/), was developed, which systematically described the variations of np contents and their corresponding mechanisms. the platform comprises 2201 nps and 694 biological resources, including plants, bacteria, and fungi, curated using 126 diverse factors with 26,425 records. each record contains information about the species, np, and factors involved, as well as np content data, parts of the plant that produce nps, the location of the experiment, and reference information. all factors were manually curated and categorized into 42 classes which belong to four mechanisms (molecular regulation, species factor, environmental condition, and combined factor). additionally, the cross-links of species and np to well-established databases and the visualization of np content under various experimental conditions were provided. in conclusion, npcvar is a valuable resource for understanding the relationship between species, factors, and np contents and is anticipated to serve as a promising tool for improving the yield of high-value nps and facilitating the development of new therapeutics.",AB_0189
