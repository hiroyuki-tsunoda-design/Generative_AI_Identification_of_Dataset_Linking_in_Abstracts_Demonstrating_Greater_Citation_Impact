"objective the aim of this study was to search for key genes in ankylosing spondylitis (as) through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, thus providing some theoretical support for future diagnosis and treatment of as and further research. methods gene expression profiles were collected from gene expression omnibus (geo, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/geo/) by searching for the term ankylosing spondylitis. ultimately, two microarray datasets (gse73754 and gse11886) were downloaded from the geo database. a bioinformatic approach was used to screen differentially expressed genes and perform functional enrichment analysis to obtain biological functions and signalling pathways associated with the disease. weighted correlation network analysis ( wgcna) was used to further obtain key genes. immune infiltration analysis was performed using the cibersort algorithm to conduct a correlation analysis of key genes with immune cells. the gwas data of as were analysed to identify the pathogenic regions of key genes in as. finally, potential therapeutic agents for as were predicted using these key genes. results a total of 7 potential biomarkers were identified: dysf, basp1, pygl, spi1, c5ar1, anpep and sorl1. roc curves showed good prediction for each gene. t cell, cd4 naive cell, and neutrophil levels were significantly higher in the disease group than in the paired normal group, and key gene expression was strongly correlated with immune cells. cmap results showed that the expression profiles of ibuprofen, forskolin, bongkrek-acid, and cimaterol showed the most significant negative correlation with the expression profiles of disease perturbations, suggesting that these drugs may play a role in as treatment. conclusion the potential biomarkers of as screened in this study are closely related to the level of immune cell infiltration and play an important role in the immune microenvironment. this may provide help in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of as and provide new ideas for further research.",AB_0171
"fruit quality assessment, grading and sorting are of vital importance to fruit processing, and all these involve fruit recognition. vision-based fruit recognition can recognize fruit automatically and further support more applications such as fruit-picking robots, self-checkout service, and dietary guidance. recent works resort to convolutional neural networks (cnns) for vision-based fruit recognition because of their powerful expressive capacity. however, most works simply utilize existing cnns and ignore characteristics of fruit images, resulting in sub-optimal recognition performance. to solve this problem, we adopt a multi-scale attention network (msanet), which explores attention from different layers of cnns and aggregates various visual attentional features from different levels into final comprehensive representations. extensive evaluations on four fruit benchmark datasets demonstrate that the method achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance. in addition, we report various experimental results from different deep networks as baselines. codes and models will be released upon publication. models and code are available at http://123.57.42.89/codes/msanet.html.",AB_0171
"infrared (ir) image segmentation technology plays a pivotal role in many urgent fields, such as traffic surveillance, nondestructive detection and autonomous driving. in recent years, active contour model (acm) has been one of the most commonly used tools for image segmentation, but the precision sharply decreases when dealing with ir images with intensity inhomogeneity. to solve this problem, a new acm based on global and local multi-feature fusion (glmf) is proposed in this paper. first of all, the multi-feature fitting maps inside and outside the contour are calculated using the strategy of global and local information fusion. then, a hybrid signed pressure function (spf) is designed by combining multiple fitting error maps, which are measured by the similarity between the multi-feature fitting map and the original feature map. next, a level set formulation (lsf) is constructed using the proposed hybrid spf and the level set function is thus evolved. finally, the contour of ir foreground object with visual saliency can be extracted using the zero level set of the converged level set function. both qualitative and quantitative experiments based on ir datasets verify that the presented acm has remarkable advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared with other typical acms. our codes are available at https://github.com/minjiewan/global-and-local-multi-feature-fusion-based-active-contour-model-for-infrared-image-segmentation.",AB_0171
"motivated by the lack of long-term global soil moisture products with both high spatial and temporal resolutions, a global 1 km daily spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture product (glass sm) was generated from 2000 to 2020 using an ensemble learning model (extreme gradient boosting - xgboost). the model was developed by integrating multiple datasets, including albedo, land surface temperature, and leaf area index products from the global land surface satellite (glass) product suite, as well as the european reanalysis (era5-land) soil moisture product, in situ soil moisture dataset from the international soil moisture network (ismn), and auxiliary datasets (multi-error-removed improved-terrain (merit) dem and global gridded soil information (soilgrids)). given the relatively large-scale differences between point-scale in situ measurements and other datasets, the triple collocation (tc) method was adopted to select the representative soil moisture stations and their measurements for creating the training samples. to fully evaluate the model performance, three validation strategies were explored: random, site independent, and year independent. results showed that although the xgboost model achieved the highest accuracy on the random test samples, it was clearly a result of model overfitting. meanwhile, training the model with representative stations selected by the tc method could considerably improve its performance for site- or year-independent test samples. the overall validation accuracy of the model trained using representative stations on the site-independent test samples, which was least likely to be overfitted, was a correlation coefficient ( r) of 0.715 and root mean square error (rmse) of 0.079m(3) m(-3). moreover, compared to the model developed without station filtering, the validation accuracies of the model trained with representative stations improved significantly for most stations, with the median r and unbiased rmse (ubrmse) of the model for each station increasing from 0.64 to 0.74 and decreasing from 0.055 to 0.052m(3) m(-3), respectively. further validation of the glass sm product across four independent soil moisture networks revealed its ability to capture the temporal dynamics of measured soil moisture ( r d 0.69-0.89; ubrmse d 0.033-0.048m(3) m(-3)). lastly, the intercomparison between the glass sm product and two global microwave soil moisture datasets - the 1 km soil moisture active passive/sentinel-1 l2 radiometer/radar soil moisture product and the european space agency climate change initiative combined soil moisture product at 0.25 degrees - indicated that the derived product maintained a more complete spatial coverage and exhibited high spatiotemporal consistency with those two soil moisture products. the annual average glass sm dataset from 2000 to 2020 can be freely downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7172664 (zhang et al., 2022a), and the complete product at daily scale is available at http://glass.umd.edu/soil_moisture/ (last access: 12 may 2023).",AB_0171
"the development of deep learning models in medical image analysis is majorly limited by the lack of large -sized and well-annotated datasets. unsupervised learning does not require labels and is more suitable for solving medical image analysis problems. however, most unsupervised learning methods must be applied to large datasets. to make unsupervised learning applicable to small datasets, we proposed swin mae, a masked autoencoder with swin transformer as its backbone. even on a dataset of only a few thousand medical images, swin mae can still learn useful semantic features purely from images without using any pre-trained models. it can equal or even slightly outperform the supervised model obtained by swin transformer trained on imagenet in the transfer learning results of downstream tasks. compared to mae, swin mae brought a performance improvement of twice and five times for downstream tasks on btcv and our parotid dataset, respectively. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/zian-xu/swin-mae.",AB_0171
"background the purpose of this study was to investigate the socket healing outcome after alveolar ridge preservation at infected molar sites using an erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (er:yag) laser. methods eighteen patients who needed molar extraction and exhibited signs of infection were included and allocated into either the laser group or the control group. er:yag laser irradiation for degranulation and disinfection was performed with alveolar ridge preservation (arp) in the laser group. traditional debridement with a curette was performed in the control group. two months after arp, bone tissue samples were harvested at the time of implant placement for histological analysis. assessment of dimension changes in alveolar bone was conducted by superimposing two cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) scans taken at baseline and two months after extraction. results histologically, after two months of healing, er:yag laser treatment resulted in more newly formed bone (laser: 17.75 +/- 8.75, control: 12.52 +/- 4.99, p = 0.232). moreover, greater osteocalcin (ocn) positive expression and lower runt-related transcription factor 2 (runx-2) positive expression were detected in the laser group. however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups. the difference in the vertical resorption of the buccal bone plate was statistically significant between groups (laser: -0.31 +/- 0.26 mm, control: -0.97 +/- 0.32 mm, p < 0.05). major changes in ridge width were observed at 1 mm below the bone crest. however, the differences between groups were not significant (laser: -0.36 +/- 0.31 mm, control: -1.14 +/- 1.24 mm, p = 0.171). conclusions arp with er:yag laser irradiation seemed to improve bone healing by regulating osteogenesis-related factor expression in the early stage at infected sites. trial registration the trial was registered on the chinese clinical trial registry platform (https://www.chictr.org.cn/) (registration number: chictr2300068671; registration date: 27/02/2023).",AB_0171

"domain shift is the problem in which trained models fail to maintain their performance when they confront new test domains. cross-scene classification, a technique developed to overcome this challenge, has attracted significant research interest in the field of remote sensing (rs). by exploring the correlation between the source domain and the target domain, relevant models can have better generalization ability regarding the target domain. nevertheless, domain adaptation (da), as the main technique for cross-scene classification, necessarily requires access to the target samples to assist the model training, a condition that is difficult to satisfy in real-world applications. domain generalization (dg) has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. given one or several source domain(s), dg tends to learn models that can perform well when dealing with unseen (inaccessible) target domains. dg can better deal with out-of-distribution generalization with fewer restrictions, making it a good fit for cross-scene classification. notably, little research has been conducted on domain generalization in the field of remote sensing. thus, we refer to this type of method as cross-scene generalization. recent studies have shown that convolutional neural networks have a strong bias towards recognizing textures rather than shapes. accordingly, we proposed a style and content separation network (scsn) for rs image cross-scene generalization in this paper, which can improve the generalizability and discriminative capability. the style and content separation (scs) module uses instance normalization to obtain the content information and thereby ensure better generalization ability. moreover, the residual feature, which contains the style information, can supplement the feature representations after refinement. we further proposed a separation loss to constrain the style and content separation process. experimental results and relevant analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scsn on cross-scene generalization tasks. code is available at https://github.com/whuzhusihan96/scsn.",AB_0171
"infrared small target detection is a research core of infrared image processing and machine vision that is widely applied to civil and military fields. although the accuracy and efficiency of infrared small target detection have been significantly improved in recent years, the issues of missing detection and false alarms with complex scenes remain because infrared small targets usually have small sizes and weak signals and are submerged by the backgrounds. to cope with the abovementioned problems, we propose in this paper an infrared small target detection method using coordinate attention and feature fusion, named caff-net. first, we present a deep and shallow feature fusion strategy to improve the detection probability, which captures both the low-level structural and textural features and the high-level semantic information of small targets to avoid missing detection. second, we adopt the coordinate attention mechanism to highlight the target salience and suppress background interference in the feature map, which is able to decrease the false alarm rate with complex scenes. third, we contribute a real-world infrared small target dataset, named nchu-sirst. the constructed dataset consists of 273 training frames and 317 test frames and offers a comprehensive comparison for various infrared small target detection methods with different scenes. finally, we run our method on the nchu-sirst dataset to conduct a comparison with some existing traditional and deep-learning-based infrared small target detection methods. the experimental results demonstrate that the presented caff-net method performs competitively among the comparable methods, especially with the high detection probability and low false alarm ratio under complex scenes.
