"plant detection and counting play a crucial role in modern agriculture, providing vital references for precision management and resource allocation. this study follows the footsteps of machine learning experts by introducing the state-of-the-art yolov8 technology into the field of plant science. moreover, we made some simple yet effective improvements. the integration of shallow-level information into the path aggregation network (panet) served to counterbalance the resolution loss stemming from the expanded receptive field. the enhancement of upsampled features was accomplished through combining the lightweight up-sampling operator content-aware reassembly of features (carafe) with the multi-efficient channel attention (mlt-eca) technique to optimize the precision of upsampled features. this collective approach markedly amplified the discernment of small objects in unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) images, naming it yolov8-uav. our evaluation is based on datasets containing four different plant species. experimental results demonstrate the strong competitiveness of our proposed method even when compared to the most advanced counting techniques, and it possesses sufficient robustness. in order to advance the cross-disciplinary research of computer vision and plant science, we also release a new cotton boll dataset with detailed annotated bounding box information. what's more, we address previous oversights in existing wheat ear datasets by providing updated labels consistent with global research advancements. overall, this research offers practitioners a powerful solution for addressing real-world application challenges. for uav scenarios, recommend using the specialized yolov8-uav, while yolov8-n is a wise choice for general scenes due to its sufficient accuracy and speed in the majority of cases. furthermore, we contribute two meaningful datasets that have research significance, effectively promoting the application of data resources in the field of plant science. in short, our contribution is to improve the use of yolov8 in uav scenarios and open two datasets with bounding boxes. the curated data and code can be accessed at the following link: https://github.com/ye-sk/plant-dataset.",AB_0324
"in recent years, there has been extensive research on the routing problem of printed circuit boards (pcbs). due to the increasing number of pins, high pin density, and unique physical constraints, manual pcb routing has become a time-consuming task to achieve design convergence. previous work decomposed the problem into escape routing and area routing, focusing on these problems separately. however, there was always a gap between these two problems, requiring significant human effort for iterative algorithm adjustments. furthermore, previous area routing work mainly focused on routing between ball grid array (bga) packages in escape routing. however, in practice, many components are not in the form of bga packages, such as passive devices, decoupling capacitors, and through-hole pin arrays. therefore, it is necessary to study a unified routing approach. the current unified routing approach adopts the a* algorithm, but there is still room for improvement in routing speed. this paper proposes a new algorithm called unet-astar, which accelerates the routing efficiency by employing deep learning algorithms in a simulated environment. additionally, a deeper unet is proposed for generating recommended regions for the routing algorithm. the new network structure can provide more contextual information, thereby improving routing efficiency. experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. specifically, for all given test cases, our router achieves approximately a 70% improvement in runtime speed compared to the old router. another major contribution of this work is the development of a routing problem set generator, which can generate parameterized routing problem sets with different sizes and constraints. this enables the evaluation of different routing algorithms and the generation of training datasets for future data-driven routing methods. all the code has been open-sourced and can be found at https://github.com/firesuiry/unet-astar-for-pcb-routing.",AB_0324
"extracting roads from high spatial resolution imagery (hsri) has been a hot research topic in recent years. particularly, the fully convolutional network (fcn)-based methods have shown promising performance in accurately extracting roads from hsri. however, most existing fcn-based approaches suffer from such deficiencies of convolution in spatial detail loss, inadequate fusion of multi-scale features, and lack of consideration for long-range dependencies, making road extraction from hsri remain a challenging task. to address the above challenges, based on linknet architecture, this paper provided a novel neural network named rfe-linknet, which employs a u-shaped framework and integrates several receptive field enhancement modules and dual attention modules. in the rfe-linknet, in order to enhance the spatial information perception and capture long-range dependencies, the multiple receptive field enhancement module is devised to expand the receptive field while preserving the spatial details of feature maps. and dual attention module is provided to capture accurate features for road extraction by refining multi-scale features from the different-level feature maps in the view of their relative importance. experiments on massachusetts road dataset and deepglobe road dataset are conducted to evaluate the performance of rfe-linknet, respectively. experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to previous road extraction, establishing its state-of-the-art effectiveness. the code of rfe-linknet is available at https://github.com/zhengxc97/rfe_linknet.",AB_0324
"temporal modeling is the essential to achieve video super-resolution. most models use alignment or recurrent methods to directly exploit the temporal information of consecutive frames. however, the feature information extracted directly from the input frames is coarse, which affects the performance and generalization ability of the model. thus, in this paper, we propose to investigate the role of recurrent feature updating networks. the feature update module is proposed to update and optimize the input information to improve the accuracy of features. we design the model as a multi-stage form to improve performance and generalization. moreover, to further improve the performance of the model, we propose the difference supplement module. it allows the model to exploit the temporal differences between groups to complement the missing information in the output of each stage. experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves 27.78 db, 30.44 db, and 39.38 db on vid4, spmcs, and udm10, respectively, which indicates that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on video super-resolution. code is available at https://github.com/gfli123/rfun.",AB_0324
"human activity recognition (har) commonly employs wearable sensors to identify and analyze the time series data collected by them, enabling the recognition of specific actions. however, the current fusion of convolutional and recurrent neural networks in existing approaches encounters difficulties when it comes to differentiating between similar actions. to enhance the recognition accuracy of similar actions, we suggest integrating the residual structure and layer normalization into a bidirectional long short-term memory network (blstm). this integration enhances the network's feature extraction capabilities, introduces an attention mechanism to optimize the final feature information, and ultimately improves the accuracy and stability of activity recognition. to validate the effectiveness of our approach, we extensively tested it on three public datasets: uci-har, wisdm, and ku-har. the results were highly encouraging, achieving remarkable overall recognition accuracies of 98.37%, 99.01%, and 97.89% for the respective datasets. the experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the recognition accuracy of similar behaviors. a codebase implementing the described framework is available at: https://github.com/lyh0625/1dcnn-resblstm-attention.",AB_0324
"fourier ptychographic microscopy (fpm) is a recently developed computational imaging technique which can perform complex amplitude imaging with both large field of view and high resolution by using a simple microscope setup. here, we propose a transformer based neural network named as fp-transformer, which takes the low-resolution amplitude (lra) images as the sequential input and uses self-attention mechanism to compute the relationship among them. the high-resolution fpm complex amplitude reconstruction is the end-to-end output of the fp-transformer. we apply the image library of div2k to generate the fpm lra images with the physical model, and then perform the training and validation with this dataset containing ground truth. we also perform the validation with the experiment images and it is found that the high-quality fpm complex amplitude image pairs can be obtained. therefore, the fp-transformer creates a new platform for the fpm deep learning reconstruction, which has the better dependability and adaptability. the code of this work will be available at https://github.com/zhaolin6/fptransfomer for the sake of reproducibility.",AB_0324
"contrastive learning (cl) has been successfully applied in natural language processing (nlp) as a powerful representation learning method and has shown promising results in various downstream tasks. recent research has highlighted the importance of constructing effective contrastive samples through data augmentation. however, current data augmentation methods primarily rely on random word deletion, substitution, and cropping, which may introduce noisy samples and hinder representation learning. in this article, we propose a novel approach to address data imbalance in text classification by constructing contrastive samples. our method involves the use of a label-indicative component to generate high-quality positive samples for the minority class, along with the introduction of a hard negative mixing strategy to synthesize challenging negative samples at the feature level. by applying supervised contrastive learning to these samples, we are able to obtain superior text representations, which significantly benefit text classification tasks with imbalanced data. our approach effectively mitigates distributional biases and promotes noise-resistant representation learning. to validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on benchmark datasets (thucnews, ag's news, 20ng) as well as the imbalanced fdcnews dataset. the code for our method is publicly available at the following github repository: https://github.com/hanggun/cldmtc.",AB_0324
"metallographic image segmentation is a core task towards the automation of metallographic analysis. currently, the most advanced methods for this task generally employ supervised deep learning segmentation models that require a great number of pixel-level annotated images, while the annotation process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. in order to address this issue, a semi-supervised model called con2net is proposed in this work, which leverages unlabeled data to improve performance for metallographic image segmentation. the con2net model adopts a multi-decoder architecture, which enforces consistency constraint between each decoder's output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels produced by output sharpening. in addition, to mitigate the negative impact caused by sharpening on false predicted pixels, we adopt the sharpening operation only to accurately predicted pixels. for labeled pixels, comparing ground truth to filter out correctly predicted pixels is the simplest and most effective approach. for unlabeled pixels, a contrastive learning module is introduced, which encourages the model to have better intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion in the feature space. based on that, pseudo-labels for unlabeled pixels are obtained by calculating the maximum similarity of feature vectors, and then the accurately predicted unlabeled pixels could be filtered out. we conduct experiments on two public datasets for metallographic image segmentation, comparing the proposed con2net model with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation models on three semi-supervised data partition protocols. the results demonstrate that con2net not only outperforms the supervised baseline by a significant margin, but also achieves superior segmentation performance compared to other five semi-supervised models. our source code is available at https://github.com/siiimon2423/con2net.",AB_0324
"to address the challenges of obtaining network state information, flexibly forwarding data, and improving the communication quality of service (qos) in wireless network transmission environments in response to dynamic changes in network topology, this paper introduces an intelligent routing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (drl) with network situational awareness under a software-defined wireless networking (sdwn) architecture. first, comprehensive network traffic information is collected under the sdwn architecture, and a graph convolutional network-gated recurrent unit (gcn-gru) prediction mechanism is used to perceive future traffic trends. second, a proximal policy optimization (ppo) drl-based data forwarding mechanism is designed in the knowledge plane. the predicted network traffic matrix and topology information matrix are treated as the drl environment, while next-hop adjacent nodes are treated as executable actions, and action selection policies are designed for different network conditions. to guide the learning and improvement of the drl agent's routing strategy, reward functions of different forms are designed by utilizing network link information and different penalty mechanisms. additionally, importance sampling steps and gradient clipping methods are employed during gradient updating to enhance the convergence speed and stability of the designed intelligent routing method. experimental results show that this solution outperforms traditional routing methods in network throughput, delay, packet loss rate, and wireless node distance. compared to value-function-based dueling deep q-network (dqn) routing, the convergence of the proposed method is significantly faster and more stable. simultaneously, hardware storage consumption is reduced, and real-time routing decisions can be made using the current network state information. the source code can be accessed at https://github.com/guetye/drl-pponsa.",AB_0324
"within natural language processing, multi-label classification is an important but challenging task. it is more complex than single-label classification since the document representations need to cover fine-grained label information, while the labels predicted by the model are often related. recently, large pre-trained language models have achieved great performance on multi-label classification tasks, typically using embedding of [cls] vector as the semantic representation of entire document and matching it with candidate labels. however, existing methods tend to ignore label semantics, and the relationships between labels and documents are not effectively mined. in addition, the linear layers used for fine-tuning do not take the correlations between labels into account. in this work, we propose a multi-label guided network (mlgn) capable to guide document representation with multi-label semantic information. furthermore, we utilize correlation knowledge to enhance the original label prediction in downstream tasks. the extensive experimental trials show that mlgn transcends previous works on several publicly available datasets. our source code is available at https://github.com/l199q/mlgn.",AB_0324
