"background patient-surgeon communication is an important component of the success of a consultation and is known to impact patient outcomes. the aim of this study was to investigate whether a document called a question prompt list, containing suggested questions that a patient may like to ask their doctor, improved communication.methods a prospective rct was conducted from october 2021 to october 2022 at the queen elizabeth hospital, adelaide, australia. patients 16 years or older, seeing a general surgeon for a pre-surgical consultation, not requiring a translator, were randomized to receive a question prompt list (intervention) or standard care without a question prompt list (control). the primary outcomes were number of questions asked, talk time, and mutual eye gaze. secondary outcomes were patient recall of information, anxiety, and consultation duration. randomization was achieved using a computer program, with allocation concealment by opaque sequentially numbered envelopes. patients were blinded to study group; surgeons were aware of study group, but blinded to outcomes.results patients (59) were randomly allocated to receive the question prompt list (31) or to the control group (28). a patient from the intervention group withdrew before consultation, resulting in 58 patients being included in the analysis. in the question prompt list consultations, 24 per cent more questions were asked (incidence rate ratio = 1.25, 95 per cent c.i. 1.10 to 1.42; p = 0.001). the intervention group recalled 9 per cent more items than the control group (incidence rate ratio = 1.09, 95 per cent c.i. 1.02 to 1.17; p = 0.012). the control group were 26 per cent less likely to correctly recall information about surgical treatment (or = 0.26, 95 per cent c.i. 0.10 to 0.68; p = 0.006). no statistically significant differences between study arms for talk time, mutual eye gaze, anxiety, or consultation duration were demonstrated.conclusion the question prompt list was associated with increased question asking and greater patient recall of medical information. it did not increase patient anxiety or consultation duration.registration number actrn12623000089639 (http://www.anzctr.org.au). this rct demonstrated that the provision of a question prompt list to surgical patients resulted in more questions being asked and in more information being recalled. the question prompt list did not significantly increase consultation duration and had no impact on patient anxiety.",AB_0084
"the efficacy of low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets, such as ketogenic diets, for cancer patients is of research interest. we previously demonstrated the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in a case study in which medium-chain triglycerides (mcts) or mct-containing formula (ketogenic formula) was used as a supplement to increase blood ketone bodies. however, little is known about the amounts needed to induce ketogenic effects and about the usefulness of monitoring of breath acetone. to investigate the pharmacokinetics of mcts and their metabolites, blood ketone bodies and breath acetone, 24 healthy subjects received one of four single oral doses of the ketogenic formula (equivalent to 0, 10, 20, and 30 g of mcts) under fasting conditions. total blood ketone bodies, beta-hydroxybutyrate, octanoic acid, and decanoic acid were increased in a dose-dependent manner. the ketogenic effect was considered to depend on octanoic and decanoic acids, because a positive correlation was observed between them. a strong positive correlation was also observed between total serum ketone bodies and breath acetone at each time points. therefore, monitoring breath acetone levels seems a less invasive method to predict blood concentrations of ketone bodies during ketogenic diet therapy.clinical trial registration:https://rctportal.niph.go.jp/en/detail?trial_id=umin000032634, umin-ctr umin000032634.",AB_0084
"it is unknown whether there are age-and gender-related differences in the safety and efficacy of potent p2y12 inhibitors in east asian populations with a different bleeding or ischemic propensity. using data from the ticakorea (ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in asian/korean patients with acs intended for invasive management) trial comparing ticagrelor versus clopidogrel for 800 korean patients with acute coronary syndrome, the safety and efficacy outcomes were compared according to age (<75 vs >= 75 years) and gen -der (men vs women). the primary bleeding end point was clinically significant bleeding, and the primary ischemic end point was a major adverse cardiovascular event (mace) at 12 months. the incidences of clinically significant bleeding were significantly higher after ticagrelor than after clopidogrel in patients aged <75 years (adjusted hazard ratio [hr] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.40 to 4.67) but not in patients aged >= 75 years (adjusted hr 1.1, 95% ci 0.40 to 3.38). the incidences of maces were significantly higher after ticagrelor than after clopidogrel in patients aged >= 75 years (adjusted hr 6.14, 95% ci 1.40 to 26.90) but not in patients aged <75 years (adjusted hr 0.93, 95% ci 0.50 to 1.73). the incidences of clinically significant bleeding were significantly higher after ticagrelor than after clopidogrel in men (adjusted hr 2.69, 95% ci 1.38 to 5.24) but not in women (adjusted hr 1.49, 95% ci 0.64 to 3.46). the adjusted risks of maces after ticagrelor or clopidogrel were not significantly different between men and women. in conclusion, there were substantial age-and gender-related differences in bleeding and ischemic outcomes after ticagrelor or clopidogrel in korean patients with acute coronary syndrome. clinical trial registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov unique identi-fier: nct02094963.

"microbiome data obtained with amplicon sequencing are considered as compositional data. it has been argued that these data can be analysed after appropriate transformation to log-ratios, but ratios and logarithms cause problems with the many zeroes in typical microbiome experiments. we demonstrate that some well chosen sign and rank transformations also allow for valid inference with compositional data, and we show how logistic regression and probabilistic index models can be used for testing for differential abundance, while inheriting the flexibility of a statistical modelling framework. the results of a simulation study demonstrate that the new methods perform better than most other methods, and that it is comparable with ancom-bc. these methods are implemented in an r-package 'signtrans' and can be installed from github (https://github.com/lucp9827/signtrans).",AB_0084
"3d point clouds are discrete samples of continuous surfaces which can be used for various applications. however, the lack of true connectivity information, i.e., edge information, makes point cloud recognition challenging. recent edge-aware methods incorporate edge modeling into network designs to better describe local structures. although these methods show that incorporating edge information is beneficial, how edge information helps remains unclear, making it difficult for users to analyze its usefulness. to shed light on this issue, in this study, we propose a new algorithm called diffusion unit (du) that handles edge information in a principled and interpretable manner while providing decent improvement. first, we theoretically show that du learns to perform task-beneficial edge enhancement and suppression. second, we experimentally observe and verify the edge enhancement and suppression behavior. third, we empirically demonstrate that this behavior contributes to performance improvement. extensive experiments and analyses performed on challenging benchmarks verify the effectiveness of du. specifically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in object part segmentation using shapenet part and scene segmentation using s3dis. our source code is available at https://github.com/martianxiu/diffusionunit.",AB_0084
"background information is an important aspect of pre-processing for advanced applications in computer vision. the literature has made rapid progress in background initialization. however, background initialization still suffers from high-dynamic complex scenes, such as illumination change, background motion, or camera jitter. therefore, this study presents a novel co-occurrence spatial-temporal (cost) model for background initialization in high-dynamic complex scenes. cost achieves a spatial-temporal model through a co-occurrence pixel-block structure. the proposed approach extracts the spatial-temporal information of pixels to self-adaptively generate the background without the influence of high-dynamic complex scenes. the efficiency of cost is verified through experimental results compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. the source code of cost is available online at: https://github.com/hellomrdeng/cost.git.",AB_0084
"this study investigates the effects of including patients' clinical information on the performance of deep learning (dl) classifiers for disease location in chest x-ray images. although current classifiers achieve high performance using chest x-ray images alone, consultations with practicing radiologists indicate that clinical data is highly informative and essential for interpreting medical images and making proper diagnoses. in this work, we propose a novel architecture consisting of two fusion methods that enable the model to simultaneously process patients' clinical data (structured data) and chest x-rays (image data). since these data modalities are in different dimensional spaces, we propose a spatial arrangement strategy, spatialization, to facilitate the multimodal learning process in a mask r-cnn model. we performed an extensive experimental evaluation using mimic-eye, a dataset comprising different modalities: mimic-cxr (chest x-ray images), mimic iv-ed (patients' clinical data), and reflacx (annotations of disease locations in chest x-rays). results show that incorporating patients' clinical data in a dl model together with the proposed fusion methods improves the disease localization in chest x-rays by 12% in terms of average precision compared to a standard mask r-cnn using chest x-rays alone. further ablation studies also emphasize the importance of multimodal dl architectures and the incorporation of patients' clinical data in disease localization. in the interest of fostering scientific reproducibility, the architecture proposed within this investigation has been made publicly accessible(https://github.com/chihchenghsieh/multimodal-abnormalities-detection).",AB_0084
"kinases play a vital role in regulating essential cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, growth, apoptosis, and metabolism, by catalyzing the transfer of phosphate groups from adenosing triphosphate to substrates. their dysregulation has been closely associated with numerous diseases, including cancer development, making them attractive targets for drug discovery. however, accurately predicting the binding affinity between chemical compounds and kinase targets remains challenging due to the highly conserved structural similarities across the kinome. to address this limitation, we present kinscan, a novel computational approach that leverages large-scale bioactivity data and integrates the multi-scale context aware transformer framework to construct a virtual profiling model encompassing 391 protein kinases. the developed model demonstrates exceptional prediction capability, distinguishing between kinases by utilizing structurally aligned kinase binding site features derived from multiple sequence alignment for fast and accurate predictions. through extensive validation and benchmarking, kinscan demonstrated its robust predictive power and generalizability for large-scale kinome-wide profiling and selectivity, uncovering associations with specific diseases and providing valuable insights into kinase activity profiles of compounds. furthermore, we deployed a web platform for end-to-end profiling and selectivity analysis, accessible at https://kinscan.drugonix.com/softwares/kinscan.",AB_0084
"nickel selenide (nise) has been a promising positive electrode for hybrid supercapacitors due to its multiple oxidation states, tunability, and high specific capacity. however, sluggish ion transfers and particle agglomeration hamper its electrochemical performance. in the present study, we have grown nise nanoparticles on two-dimensional (2d) graphitic carbon nitride (g-c3n4) nanosheets to realize three-dimensional (3d) architecture. the 2d support, high nitrogen content, and features of g-c3n4 enhanced the specific capacity of the nise/g-c3n4 nanocomposite material. the resulting nanocomposite shows a specific capacity of 320 ma h g-1 at a current density of 1 a g-1, which is considerably higher than pristine nise. later, the hybrid supercapacitor (hsc) device was fabricated using nise/g-c3n4 composite as positive and activated carbon (ac) as negative electrodes. the cell delivered an energy density of 52.5 wh kg-1 at a power density of 1488 w kg-1 with excellent cyclic stability of 84.9% over 8000 cycles. the electrochemical performance enhancement corresponds to a 3d structure, high electrochemical active sites, and improved charge transportation at the electrode/electrolyte interface. thus, the present work offers an easy approach and architectural design for high-performance hsc.(c) 2023 science press and dalian institute of chemical physics, chinese academy of sciences. published by elsevier b.v. and science press. this is an open access article under the cc by license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",AB_0084
"this paper presents an end-to-end solution, the spectral filter array (sfa)-guided mosaic transformer (smt), designed for tracking small objects within mosaic spectral videos captured by snapshot spectral cameras. tracking small objects amidst complex scenes poses greater challenges due to their variable appearances and limited feature representation. spectral imaging, leveraging spectral and spatial information to characterize the material properties of objects, offers enhanced object feature discrimination compared to conventional visual imaging, making it an ideal choice for this task. existing spectral tracking techniques, however, fall short in delivering satisfactory results for small objects due to their disruption of spatial-spectral aliasing correlations or disregard for small object characteristics. hence, the proposed smt leverages sfa guidance to model and aggregate multi-layer features effectively. comprising the sfa-guided mosaic backbone (smb), multi-layer feature aggregation (mfa), and prediction head, smt extracts hierarchical features directly from mosaic spectral images, amalgamates interdependencies between shallow-layer detail and deep-layer semantic information, and precisely locates small objects. experiment results on our curated fully-annotated mosaic spectral small object tracking dataset, alongside a public normal-sized object tracking dataset, showcase smt's prowess in adeptly tracking small objects amidst challenging scenarios such as occlusion and drift. specifically, our smt achieves gains ranging from 0.3% to 5.3% in average precision rate and from 2.0% to 5.1% in average success rate over the second-ranked trackers across various challenging attributes. the dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/chenlulu1993/smt.",AB_0084
