"how to effectively convert genomic summary data into downstream knowledge discovery represents a major challenge in human genomics research. to address this challenge, we have developed efficient and effective approaches and tools. extending our previously established software tools, we here introduce openxgr (http://www.openxgr.com), a newly designed web server that offers almost real-time enrichment and subnetwork analyses for a user-input list of genes, snps or genomic regions. it achieves so through leveraging ontologies, networks, and functional genomic datasets (such as promoter capture hi-c, e/pqtl and enhancer-gene maps for linking snps or genomic regions to candidate genes). six analysers are provided, each doing specific interpretations tailored to genomic summary data at various levels. three enrichment analysers are designed to identify ontology terms enriched for input genes, as well as genes linked from input snps or genomic regions. three subnetwork analysers allow users to identify gene subnetworks from input gene-, snp- or genomic region-level summary data. with a step-by-step user manual, openxgr provides a user-friendly and all-in-one platform for interpreting summary data on the human genome, enablingmore integrated and effective knowledge discovery.

"drug discovery, which plays a vital role in maintaining human health, is a persistent challenge. fragment-based drug discovery (fbdd) is one of the strategies for the discovery of novel candidate compounds. computational tools in fbdd could help to identify potential drug leads in a cost-efficient and time-saving manner. the auto core fragment in sil-ico screening (acfis) server is a well-established and effective online tool for fbdd. however, the accurate prediction of protein-fragment binding mode and affinity is still a major challenge for fbdd due to weak binding affinity. here, we present an updated version (acfis 2.0), that incorporates a dynamic fragment growing strategy to consider protein flexibility. the major improvements of acfis 2.0 include (i) increased accuracy of hit compound identification (from 75.4% to 88.5% using the same test set), (ii) improved rationality of the protein-fragment binding mode, (iii) increased structural diversity due to expanded fragment libraries and (iv) inclusion of more comprehensive functionality for predicting molecular properties. three successful cases of drug lead discovery using acfis 2.0 are described, including drugs leads to treat parkinson's disease, cancer, and major depressive disorder. these cases demonstrate the utility of this web-based server. acfis 2.0 is freely available at http://chemyang.ccnu.edu.cn/ccb/ server/ acfis2/.",AB_0318
"protein phosphorylation, catalyzed by protein kinases (pks), is one of the most important post-translational modifications (ptms), and involved in regulating almost all of biological processes. here, we report an updated server, group-based prediction system (gps) 6.0, for prediction of pk-specific phosphorylation sites (p-sites) in eukaryotes. first, we pre-trained a general model using penalized logistic regression (plr), deep neural network (dnn), and light gradient boosting machine (lightgmb) on 490 762 non-redundant p-sites in 71 407 proteins. then, transfer learning was conducted to obtain 577 pk-specific predictors at the group, family and single pk levels, using a well-curated data set of 30 043 known site-specific kinase-substrate relations in 7041 proteins. together with the evolutionary information, gps 6.0 could hierarchically predict pk-specific p-sites for 44046 pks in 185 species. besides the basic statistics, we also offered the knowledge from 22 public resources to annotate the prediction results, including the experimental evidence, physical interactions, sequence logos, and p-sites in sequences and 3d structures. the gps 6.0 server is freely available at https://gps.biocuckoo.cn. we believe that gps 6.0 could be a highly useful service for further analysis of phosphorylation.

"background: streptomyces lavendulae is a bacterium that produces 1-deoxynojirimycin (dnj), an alkaloid with various beneficial pharmacological properties. while a putative dnj biosynthesis metabolite pathway has been proposed for this bacterium, the related key genes have not yet been identified. results: in this study, dnj production during s. lavendulae fermentation was induced by mulberry seed extracts and the key genes related to dnj biosynthesis under those experimental conditions were identified using transcriptome sequencing. gene expression was then analyzed using real-time qpcr, and related to metabolite levels in the dnj pathway. the mulberry seed polysaccharide extract (msp) induced dnj yield in s. lavendulae broth more effectively than the mulberry seed alkaloid and flavonoid extracts. supplementation with 3.00 mg/ml msp resulted in 27.19 lg/ml dnj, which was 8.55 times than that in the control group (3.18 lg/ml). transcriptome sequencing revealed 2328 differentially expressed genes (degs) in msp vs. unsupplemented-control comparisons, of which 1151 degs were up-regulated and 1177 degs were down-regulated in msp. functional enrichment analysis revealed four pathways of dnj biosynthesis. six key genes related to dnj biosynthesis were then validated using real-time qpcr and the analysis of intermediate metabolites. these were, aspc, encoding a putative transaminase that produces 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-mannitol-6-phosphate; mj0374-1 and mj0374-2, encoding a phosphatase that produces 2-amino-2-deoxy- d-mannitol; and frma-1, frma-2, and adhd, which encode a zn-dependent dehydrogenase that produces mannojirimycin. conclusions: this is the first study to identify the genes relevant for dnj biosynthesis in s. lavendulae, and it paves the way for engineering the bacterium to achieve for industrial-scale dnj production. how to cite: xin x, jiang x, niu b, et al. identification and expression of key genes related to 1-deoxynojirimycin biosynthesis in streptomyces lavendulae. electron j biotechnol 2023; 64. https://doi. org/10.1016/j.ejbt.2023.03.003.

"self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graphs has gained significant attention as it eliminates the need for manual labeling. however, most existing researches focus on predefined meta -paths that relies on domain knowledge, and they cannot handle the noises in graphs effectively. to address these problems, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method on heterogeneous graphs with mutual constraints of structure and feature called hemuc. specifically, in the high-order relation view, we exploit graph reachability to obtain the sequence of target nodes traversed by source nodes. furthermore, we design degree and feature constraints to reduce the noises in topological structure. in the feature view, we reconstruct the graph structure using the similarity between node features and eliminate the dependence on the original graph. finally, we propose a contrastive learning method by designing a new sampling strategy that combines the structure and feature information. the experimental results on the tasks of node classification and node clustering demonstrate that the proposed hemuc outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. the source codes of this work are available at https://github .com /zzy-graphmininglab /hemuc.",AB_0318
"recent progress in cryo-em research has ignited a revolution in biological macromolecule structure determination. resolution is an essential parameter for quality assessment of a cryo-em density map, and it is known that resolution varies in different regions of a map. currently available methods for local resolution estimation require manual adjustment of parameters and in some cases necessitate acquisition or de novo generation of so-called half maps. here, we developed cryores, a deep-learning algorithm to estimate local resolution directly from a single final cryo-em density map, specifically by learning resolution-aware patterns of density map voxels through supervised training on a large dataset comprising 1,174 experimental cryo-em density maps. cryores significantly outperforms all of the state-of-the-art competing resolution estimation methods, achieving an average rmse of 2.26 angstrom for local resolution estimation relative to the currently most reliable fsc-based method blocres, yet requiring only the single final map as input. further, cryores is able to generate a molecular mask for each map, with accuracy 12.12% higher than the masks generated by resmap. cryores is ultra-fast, fully automatic, parameter-free, applicable to cryo-em subtomogram data, and freely available at https://cryores.zhanglab.net.

"the chromatin loops in the three-dimensional (3d) structure of chromosomes are essential for the regulation of gene expression. despite the fact that high-throughput chromatin capture techniques can identify the 3d structure of chromosomes, chromatin loop detection utilizing biological experiments is arduous and time-consuming. therefore, a computational method is required to detect chromatin loops. deep neural networks can form complex representations of hi-c data and provide the possibility of processing biological datasets. therefore, we propose a bagging ensemble one-dimensional convolutional neural network (be-1dcnn) to detect chromatin loops from genome-wide hi-c maps. first, to obtain accurate and reliable chromatin loops in genome-wide contact maps, the bagging ensemble learning method is utilized to synthesize the prediction results of multiple 1dcnn models. second, each 1dcnn model consists of three 1d convolutional layers for extracting high-dimensional features from input samples and one dense layer for producing the prediction results. finally, the prediction results of be-1dcnn are compared to those of the existing models. the experimental results indicate that be-1dcnn predicts high-quality chromatin loops and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using the same evaluation metrics. the source code of be-1dcnn is available for free at https://github.com/haowulab-bioinformatics/be1dcnn.",AB_0318
"hybrid recommendations have recently attracted a lot of attention where user features are utilized as auxiliary information to address the sparsity problem caused by insufficient user-item interactions. however, extracted user features generally contain rich multimodal information, and most of them are irrelevant to the recommendation purpose. therefore, excessive reliance on these features will make the model overfit on noise and difficult to generalize. in this article, we propose a variational bandwidth auto-encoder (vbae) for recommendations, aiming to address the sparsity and noise problems simultaneously. vbae first encodes user collaborative and feature information into gaussian latent variables via deep neural networks to capture non-linear user similarities. moreover, by considering the fusion of collaborative and feature variables as a virtual communication channel from an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce a user-dependent channel to dynamically control the information allowed to be accessed from the feature embeddings. a quantum-inspired uncertainty measurement of the hidden rating embeddings is proposed accordingly to infer the channel bandwidth by disentangling the uncertainty information in the ratings from the semantic information. through this mechanism, vbae incorporates adequate auxiliary information from user features if collaborative information is insufficient, while avoiding excessive reliance on noisy user features to improve its generalization ability to new users. extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/vbae.",AB_0318
"urban human mobility prediction is forecasting how people move in cities. it is crucial for many smart city applications including route optimization, preparing for dramatic shifts in modes of transportation, or mitigating the epidemic spread of viruses such as covid-19. previous research propose the maximum predictability to derive the theoretical limits of accuracy that any predictive algorithm could achieve on predicting urban human mobility. however, existing maximum predictability only considers the sequential patterns of human movements and neglects the contextual information such as the time or the types of places that people visit, which plays an important role in predicting one's next location. in this paper, we propose new theoretical limits of predictability, namely context-transition predictability, which not only captures the sequential patterns of human mobility, but also considers the contextual information of human behavior. we compare our context-transition predictability with other kinds of predictability and find that it is larger than these existing ones. we also show that our proposed context-transition predictability provides us a better guidance on which predictive algorithm to be used for forecasting the next location when considering the contextual information. source code is at https://github.com/zcfinal/contexttransitionpredictability.",AB_0318
