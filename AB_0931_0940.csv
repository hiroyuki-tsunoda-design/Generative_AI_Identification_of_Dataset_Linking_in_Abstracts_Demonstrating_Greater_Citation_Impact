"to learn the embedding representation of graph structure data corrupted by noise and outliers, existing graph structure learning networks usually follow the two-step paradigm, i.e., constructing a goodgraph structure and achieving the message passing for signals supported on the learned graph. however, the data corrupted by noise may make the learned graph structure unreliable. in this paper, we propose an adaptive graph convolutional clustering network that alternatively adjusts the graph structure and node representation layer-by-layer with back-propagation. specifically, we design a graph structure learning layer before each graph convolutional layer to learn the sparse graph structure from the node representations, where the graph structure is implicitly determined by the solution to the optimal self-expression problem. this is one of the first works that uses an optimization process as a graph network layer, which is obviously different from the function operation in traditional deep learning layers. an efficient iterative optimization algorithm is given to solve the optimal self-expression problem in the graph structure learning layer. experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively defend the negative effects of inaccurate graph structures. the code is available at https://github.com/hexiax/ssgnn. & copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0094
"structural variant (sv ) calling belongs to the standard tools of modern bioinformat-ics for identifying and describing alterations in genomes. initially, this work presents several complex genomic rearrangements that reveal conceptual ambiguities inher-ent to the representation via basic sv. we contextualize these ambiguities theoreti-cally as well as practically and propose a graph-based approach for resolving them. for various yeast genomes, we practically compute adjacency matrices of our graph model and demonstrate that they provide highly accurate descriptions of one genome in terms of another. an open-source prototype implementation of our approach is available under the mit license at https:// github. com/ itbe- lab/ ma.",AB_0094
"predicting peptide detectability is useful in a varietyof massspectrometry (ms)-based proteomics applications, particularly targetedproteomics. however, most machine learning-based computational methodshave relied solely on information from the peptide itself, such asits amino acid sequences or physicochemical properties, despite thefact that peptides detected by ms are dependent on many factors, includingprotein sample preparation, digestion, separation, ionization, andprecursor selection during ms experiments. dbydeep (detectabilityby deep learning) is an innovative end-to-end lstm network model forpeptide detectability prediction that incorporates sequence contextsof peptides and their cleavage sites (by protease). utilizing thecleavage site contexts could improve the performance of prediction,and dbydeep outperformed existing methods in predicting peptides recognizablefrom multiple ms/ms data sets with diverse species and ms instruments.we argue for the necessity of a learning model that encompasses severalcontexts associated with peptide detection, as opposed to dependingjust on peptide sequences. there is a python implementation of dbydeepat https://github.com/biscoderepo/dbydeep.",AB_0094
"using tissue whole exome sequencing (wes) and circulating tumor cell-free dna (ctdna), this australasian leukaemia & lymphoma group translational study sought to characterize primary and acquired molecular determinants of response and resistance of marginal zone lymphoma (mzl) to zanubrutinib for patients treated in the magnolia clinical trial. wes was performed on baseline tumor samples obtained from 18 patients. for 7 patients, ctdna sequence was interrogated using a bespoke hybrid-capture next-generation sequencing assay for 48 targeted genes. somatic mutations were correlated with objective response data and survival analysis using fisher exact test and kaplan-meier (log-rank) method, respectively. baseline wes identified mutations in 33 of 48 (69%) prioritized genes. nf-& kappa;b, notch, or b-cell receptor (bcr) pathway genes were implicated in samples from 16 of 18 patients (89%). kmt2d mutations (n = 11) were most common, followed by fat1 (n = 9), notch1, notch2, tnfaip3 (n = 5), and myd88 (n = 4) mutations. myd88 or tnfaip3 mutations correlated with improved progression-free survival (pfs). kmt2d mutations trended to worse pfs. acquired resistance mutations plcg2 (r665w/r742p) and btk (c481y/c481f) were detected in 2 patients whose disease progressed. a btk e41k noncatalytic activating mutation was identified before treatment in 1 patient who was zanubrutinib-refractory. myd88, tnfaip3, and kmt2d mutations correlate with pfs in patients with relapsed/refractory mzl treated with zanubrutinib. detection of acquired btk and plcg2 mutations in ctdna while on therapy is feasible and may herald clinical disease progression. this trial was registered at https://anzctr.org.au/ as #actrn12619000024145.",AB_0094
"introduction: identification of alzheimer's disease (ad)-related transcriptomic signatures fromblood is important for early diagnosis of the disease. deep learning techniques are potent classifiers for ad diagnosis, but most have been unable to identify biomarkers because of their lack of interpretability. methods: to address these challenges, we propose a pathway information-based neural network (pinnet) to predict ad patients and analyze blood and brain transcriptomic signatures using an interpretable deep learning model. pinnet is a deep neural network (dnn) model with pathway prior knowledge from either the gene ontology or kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databases. then, a backpropagation-based model interpretation method was applied to reveal essential pathways and genes for predicting ad. results: the performance of pinnet was compared with a dnn model without a pathway. performances of pinnet outperformed or were similar to those of dnn without a pathway using blood and brain gene expressions, respectively. moreover, pinnet considers more ad-related genes as essential features than dnn without a pathway in the learning process. pathway analysis of protein-protein interaction modules of highly contributed genes showed that ad-related genes in blood were enriched with cell migration, pi3k-akt, mapk signaling, and apoptosis in blood. the pathways enriched in the brain module included cell migration, pi3k-akt, mapk signaling, apoptosis, protein ubiquitination, and t-cell activation. discussion: by integrating prior knowledge about pathways, pinnet can reveal essential pathways related to ad. the source codes are available at https://github. com/dmcb-gist/pinnet.",AB_0094
"stability of compounds in the human plasma is crucial for maintaining sufficient systemic drug exposure and considered an essential factor in the early stages of drug discovery and development. the rapid de -gradation of compounds in the plasma can result in poor in vivo efficacy. currently, there are no open-source software programs for predicting human plasma stability. in this study, we developed an attention-based graph neural network, predps to predict the plasma stability of compounds in human plasma using in-house and open-source datasets. the predps outperformed the two machine learning and two deep learning algorithms that were used for comparison indicating its stability-predicting efficiency. predps achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.1%, accuracy of 83.5%, sensitivity of 82.3%, and specificity of 84.6% when evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. in the early stages of drug discovery, predps could be a helpful method for predicting the human plasma stability of compounds. saving time and money can be accomplished by adopting an in silico-based plasma stability prediction model at the high-throughput screening stage. the source code for predps is available at https://bitbuck-et.org/krict-ai/predps and the predps web server is available at https://predps.netlify.app.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0094

"background identifying and targeting established modifiable risk factors has been a successful strategy for reducing the burden of coronar y arter y disease (cad) at the population-level. however, up to 1-in-4 patients who present with st elevation myocardial infarction do so in the absence of such risk factors. polygenic risk scores (prs) have demonstrated an ability to improve risk prediction models independent of traditional risk factors and self-reported family history, but a pathway for implementation has yet to be clearly identified. the aim of this study is to examine the utility of a cad prs to identify individuals with subclinical cad via a novel clinical pathway, triaging low or intermediate absolute risk individuals for noninvasive coronary imaging, and examining the impact on shared treatment decisions and participant experience.trial design the escalate study is a 12-month, prospective, multicenter implementation study incorporating prs into other wise standard primar y care cvd risk assessments, to identify patients at increased lifetime cad risk for noninvasive coronary imaging. one-thousand eligible participants aged 45 to 65 years old will enter the study, which applies prs to those considered low or moderate 5-year absolute cvd risk and triages those with cad prs >80% for a coronary calcium scan. the primary outcome will be the identification of subclinical cad, defined as a coronary artery calcium score (cacs) > 0 agatston units (au). multiple secondary outcomes will be assessed, including baseline cacs >100 au or >75th age-/sex -matched percentile, the use and intensity of lipid-and blood pressure-lowering therapeutics, cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and health-related quality of life (hrqol).conclusion this novel trial will generate evidence on the ability of a prs-triaged cacs to identify subclinical cad, as well as subsequent differences in traditional risk factor medical management, pharmacotherapy utilization, and participant experience.trial registration australian new zealand clinical trials registry, actrn12622000436774. trial was prospec-tively registered on march 18, 2022. https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id = 383134 (am heart j 2023;264:163-173.)",AB_0094
"the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) launched the global change observation mission - climate (gcom-c) satellite on december 23rd, 2017. as a part of the standard products of jaxa's gcom-c satellite, we developed the leaf area index (lai) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fapar) product. in comparison to other global lai and fapar products by the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) and the copernicus global land service (cgls), our products have the following advantageous features: high spatial and temporal resolution (250 m and daily); the retrieval algorithm (look-uptable) is based on the forest light environmental simulator (flies) which is a full 3-d canopy radiative transfer model as well as a vegetation landscape model and a global forest landscape map created for this study. the algorithm and ancillary data sets are completely independent of the existing products that are more or less influenced by the modis lai/fapar, providing an alternate and independent source of lai and fapar. the dataset has been created since april 2018 and is freely available on jaxa's g-portal site (https://gportal.jaxa.jp/ gpr). as a result of accuracy assessment with in-situ data, the root mean square errors (rmses) for total lai and fapar were 0.776 and 0.112, respectively. we also compared our lai and fapar estimates with three existing global datasets (proba-v/olci, modis and viirs product). the spatial distribution of lai and fapar showed different characteristics among the datasets although their temporal trends were similar. the differences in estimation results among datasets due to differences in the retrieval algorithms, base map (or land cover data) and input data need to be evaluated in the future.",AB_0094
"the recognition of affective states is important for regulating stress levels and maintaining mental health, and it is known that affective states can be inferred from physiological signals. however, in practice, the problem of affect recognition contains many challenges due to various types of external noise and different individual characteristics. this paper proposes a deep learning model called attention-lrcn for recognizing affective states from photoplethysmography (ppg) signals. we construct a long-term recurrent convolutional network to extract temporal features from spectrograms, and a novel attention module is introduced to alleviate the effect of noise components in ppg signals. moreover, to improve the recognition accuracy, we propose a weighted knowledge distillation technique, which is a teacher-student learning framework. we quantify the uncertainty of teacher's predictions, and the predictive uncertainty is utilized to adaptively compute the weight of the distillation loss. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the wesad dataset, which is a public dataset for stress and affect detection. we also collected our own dataset from 34 subjects to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous algorithms on both the public and real-world datasets. the code is available at https://github.com/ziiho08/attention-lrcn.",AB_0094
