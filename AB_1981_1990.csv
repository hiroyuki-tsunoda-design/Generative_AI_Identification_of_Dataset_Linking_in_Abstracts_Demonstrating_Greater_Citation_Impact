"medical image fusion integrates beneficial information from images of different modes and has been studied as a crucial auxiliary medical technology; however, current research mainly focused on two-modal fusion problems [e.g., computed tomography (ct)-magnetic resonance imaging (mri), mri-positron emission tomography (pet)], and little attention was paid to tri-modal medical image fusion (e.g., ct-mr_t2-single photon emission ct (spect), mr_t2-mr_gad-spect). in this article, we present a tri-modal medical image fusion and denoising method that contains fusion models (i) and (ii). a three-layer decomposition based on a bitonicx filter was designed for model (i). particularly, the adaptive morphological gradient pulse-coupled neural network (am-pcnn) and the coupled neural p (cnp) system-based rules were proposed to fuse the detail and texture layers, respectively. the middle-fused result was obtained by synthesizing the prefused energy, texture, and detail layers in the model (i). in model (ii), for the fusion of the functional image and middle-fused result, we performed a detail-energy decomposition with the bitonicx filter. we also propose a gradient energy clarity (gec) operator and energy-based rules for fusing the detail and energy layers. the final fused result was obtained by adding the prefused detail layer and the energy layer in the model (ii). numerous experiments were conducted to assess the fused images objectively and subjectively, demonstrating that the proposed method developed in this study surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in noise-free and noise fusions. meanwhile, the average levels of the proposed method are 38.39%, 2.46%, 1.01%, 36.28%, 11.23%, 20.82%, 8.46%, and 2.52% higher than that of the compared methods evaluated by the metrics, including interactive information metric (qmi), tsallis entropy metric (qte), noncorrelated information entropy metric (qncie), phase consistency metric (qp), chen-blum metric (qcb), structural similarity metric (qssim), contrast-to-noise (cnr), and correlation coefficient (cc), respectively. our code is available at https://github.com/jei981214/tri-modal-bitonicx-based.",AB_0199
"background: the study aims to explore the clinical effects of vitamin d (vitd) supplements for hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht), which are unclear according to other studies. methods: female patients with newly diagnosed ht from january to june in 2018 were included. this study is registered in the chinese clinical trials registry with registration number chictr1800014619 (url: https://www.chictr.org.cn/). patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group. the treated group were further randomly assigned to a vitd supplement group or vitd & levothyroxine (l-t4) supplement group. after 6 months, we recorded and compared various indicators between different groups. results: a total of 179 patients, aged 12 to 75, were used for statistical analysis. a significant decrease in thyroid peroxidase antibody (tpoab) level was observed (351.70 +/- 183.25 vs. 246.37 +/- 157.39, p<0.001) in the vitd-treated group compared to the control group after 6 months. free triiodothyronine (ft3) and free thyroxine (ft4) level were increased (ft3: 4.30 +/- 0.64 vs. 4.84 +/- 0.9, p<0.001; ft4: 15.15 +/- 1.93 vs. 17.38 +/- 2.97, p<0.001), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (ths) level was decreased (3.58 +/- 1.78 vs. 2.25 +/- 1.22, p<0.001) in the vitd-treated group compared to the control group. conclusion: vitd supplementation can effectively slow progression of hypothyroidism, improve thyroid function, and reduce the anti-thyroid antibody level. this suggests it is useful for ht.",AB_0199
"measuring blade displacement using blade tip timing (btt) enables nonintrusive monitoring of rotating blades and their vibration frequencies. the average sampling frequency of btt is the product of the number of measurement probes and rotational frequency, which is usually far less than the blade natural frequency due to the limited number of probes. the pattern of the aliasing that arises from under-sampling is rather complex under uneven probe placement. in this article, we consider a probe placement design that is based on minimizing the maximum sidelobe level of the spectral window to suppress the aliasing frequencies in the spectrum. based on a signal model containing both asynchronous and synchronous sinusoids, we then develop an extended version of the relax method (erelax) to estimate their parameters simultaneously. model order selection rules are also used to determine the number of asynchronous sinusoids. the frequency ambiguity that arises from periodic nonuniform sampling (pns) is also discussed based on the convolution in the frequency domain. numerical simulations and results of a curved-blade experiment show that the proposed method has a mean squared estimation error less than 25% of that of two state-of-the-art methods (block-omp and music), requires 40% of the data length needed by the latter methods to achieve the same estimation accuracy, and has the smallest standard deviation of the reconstruction errors. simulation codes are available at https://github.com/superjdg/relax_btt.",AB_0199
"functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technology for monitoring cerebral hemodynamic responses. enhancing fnirs classification can improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces (bcis). currently, deep neural networks (dnns) do not consider the inherent delayed hemodynamic responses of fnirs signals, which causes many optimization and application problems. considering the kernel size and receptive field of convolutions, delayed hemodynamic responses as domain knowledge are introduced into fnirs classification, and a concise and efficient model named fnirsnet is proposed. we empirically summarize three design guidelines for fnirsnet. in subject-specific and subject-independent experiments, fnirsnet outperforms other dnns on open-access datasets. specifically, fnirsnet with only 498 parameters is 6.58% higher than convolutional neural network (cnn) with millions of parameters on mental arithmetic tasks and the floating-point operations (flops) of fnirsnet are much lower than cnn. therefore, fnirsnet is friendly to practical applications and reduces the hardware cost of bci systems. it may inspire more research on knowledge-driven models for fnirs bcis. code is available at https://github.com/wzhlearning/fnirsnet.",AB_0199
"ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used medical imaging techniques for visualizing human tissue due to its economical, convenient, practical, and safe advantages. automatic segmentation of regions of interest (rois) in ultrasound images is of great significance in improving the clinical efficiency of ultrasound images and the accuracy of disease diagnosis. however, this task has been challenging due to speckle noise, low contrast, and blurred boundaries in ultrasound images. to address these problems, this article proposes an interactive two-stream network based on detail screening and compensation called dsc-net for ultrasound image segmentation. unlike previous ultrasound image segmentation methods, our dsc-net combines the transformer and convolutional neural network (cnn) to perform accurate ultrasound image segmentation. specifically, dsc-net uses a transformer stream to obtain multiscale detailed features and a cnn stream to extract body features with less noise. then, the body features guide multiscale detailed features to filter out noise through the detail screening module. the filtered detail features are applied to the detail compensation module to supplement rich details for the cnn stream. with such interactions, dsc-net ensures that more noise-free details are extracted. extensive experiments on three datasets, including two publicly available datasets and one private dataset, demonstrate that the proposed dsc-net achieves higher performance and superior robustness than state-of-the-art ultrasound image segmentation methods. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mlmip/dsc-net.",AB_0199
"random hand gesture authentication (rga) allows the probe hand gesture types to be inconsistent with the registered ones. while it is highly user-friendly, it poses a significant challenge that requires the authentication model to distill more abstract and complex identity features. prior efforts on rga mainly use convolution operations to obtain short-term behavioral information and cannot distill robust behavioral features well. in this article, we propose a novel multiscale behavior analysis network (msba-net), with a focus on capturing multiscale behavioral features for rga, which can simultaneously distill short-term behavioral information and model long-term behavioral relationships in addition to physiological features of hand gestures. in addition, as hand motion can result in interframe semantic misalignment, we propose an efficient semantic alignment strategy to mitigate this issue, which helps extract behavior features accurately and improves model performance. the msba module is a plug-and-play module and could be integrated into existing 2-d cnns to yield a powerful video understanding model (msba-net). extensive experiments on the scut-dhga dataset demonstrate that our msba-net has compelling advantages over the other 20 state-of-the-art methods. the code is available at https://github.com/scut-bip-lab/msba-net.",AB_0199
"winding inter-turn and ground short circuit (sc) faults are common fault types of synchronous machines. the sweep frequency response analysis (sfra) has been recently introduced to detect winding sc faults. in addition, impulse fra (ifra) provides an alternative that serves the same objective. whether sfra or ifra, so far, there is still no standard and reliable interpretation code. the present interpretation of frequency response still calls for experienced personnel, which could be subjective. thus, many researchers have used machine or deep learning-based models to detect winding sc faults from the frequency response automatically. however, most proposed models cannot provide real-time feedback and update. therefore, this study proposes an improved model using life long learning strategy based on incremental classifier and representation learning (icarl) to interpret and analyze the ifra curves. this study artificially simulates and records winding sc faults on a 5-kw synchronous machine. the proposed method is then verified on the test set and compared with other traditional life long learning strategies. the experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed model is higher than 90% under all types of fault data streams in real time. the comparative experimental results show that the proposed model performs better than other life long learning strategies (github code: https://github.com/cy1034429432/improved-interpretation-of-ifra-based-on-icarl/tree/main).",AB_0199
"this article presents deformable dense residual unet (ddr-unet), a high-accuracy and efficient method for ore image segmentation (ois). ois is a crucial step in measuring ore particle size distribution (psd), but it faces challenges due to variations in particle sizes, shapes, overlaps, and powder interference. ddr-unet improves u-net in three aspects: encoder, decoder, and loss function. the encoder adopts deformable convolution to capture ore features of different sizes and shapes. the decoder employs multilevel dense residual connections to fuse low- and high-level features. the loss function uses weight-adaptive binary cross-entropy (bce) to balance the number of ore and nonore samples. we evaluate ddr-unet on an ore dataset and two public datasets, and compare it with ten state-of-the-art segmentation methods. ddr-unet outperforms all methods in ois performance and psd error. the code is available at https://github.com/lifeiwen/ddr-unet-for-ore-image-segmentat.",AB_0199
"as one of the important tasks in the field of robotics and machine vision, visual odometry provides tremendous help for various applications such as navigation, location, and so on. conventionally, the task of visual odometry mainly relies on the input of continuous images. however, it is very complicated for the odometry network to learn the epipolar geometry information provided by the images. since the 6-degree-of-freedom (dof) pose transformation occurs in 3-d space and learning poses from 3-d point clouds are more straightforward, this article introduces the concept of pseudo-lidar to the odometry task. the pseudo-lidar point cloud is formed by backprojecting the depth map generated from the image into 3-d space. due to the limitation of calculation power, most current algorithms based on the point cloud need to sample 8192 points from the point cloud as input, but such an approach makes the rich point cloud information in the pseudo-lidar point cloud not fully utilized. to address this problem, a projection-aware algorithm is adopted, which achieves efficient point cloud learning and improves the accuracy of the network while preserving the 3-d structure information in the pseudo-lidar point cloud. finally, an image-only 2-d-3-d fusion module is proposed to enhance the pseudo-lidar point features using information such as the texture and color of the images. through multimodal fusion, the network achieves a deeper understanding of the environment. experiments on the kitti dataset prove the effectiveness of our method. the source code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/irmvlab/pseudo-lidar-for-visual-odometry.",AB_0199
"the fetal electrocardiogram (fecg) is of great significance for fetal monitoring during peripartum and intrapartum. however, it is difficult to extract fecg signals from the abdominal signal (ads) due to the following issues: 1) fecg signals are always corrupted by noise and 2) the fecg signal is often masked by the high-amplitude maternal electrocardiogram (mecg). to address such problems, a correlation-aware attention cyclegan (caa-cyclegan) is proposed for fecg extraction, where the autocorrelation attention encoder (acae) module, which can capture waveform details of fecg signals by modeling its autocorrelation in the current convolution layer, is first devised to extract fecg signals corrupted by noise; then, the cross-correlation attention residual (ccar) module, which can enhance the fecg components by learning its cross-correlation between adjacent convolutional layers, is developed to discriminate fecg signals from mecg signals; finally, the dual-cross-correlation attention decoder (dccad) module, which can extract waveform features of fecg signals by exploring its dual-cross-correlation in different-level convolutional layers, is designed to extract fecg signals masked by mecg signals. experiments demonstrate that the proposed caa-cyclegan can achieve excellent performance with the mean square error (mse) of 0.082, 0.024, and 0.032 on the fecgsyndb, adfecgdb, and b2 labour datasets, respectively, which is more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods. the project is available at https://github.com/langdecc511/ caa-cyclegan.",AB_0199
