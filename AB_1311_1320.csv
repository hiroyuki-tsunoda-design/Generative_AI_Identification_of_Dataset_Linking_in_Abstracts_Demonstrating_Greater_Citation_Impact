"weakly textured objects are frequently manipulated by industrial and domestic robots, and the most common two types are transparent and reflective objects; however, their unique visual properties present challenges even for advanced grasp detection algorithms. many existing algorithms heavily rely on depth information, which is not accurately provided by ordinary red-green-blue and depth (rgb-d) sensors for transparent and reflective objects. to overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative solution that uses semantic segmentation to effectively segment weakly textured objects and guide grasp detection. by using only red-green-blue (rgb) images from rgb-d sensors, our segmentation algorithm (rtsegnet) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the newly proposed trosd dataset. importantly, our method enables robots to grasp transparent and reflective objects without requiring retraining of the grasp detection network (which is trained solely on the cornell dataset). real-world robot experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach in grasping commonly encountered weakly textured objects; furthermore, results obtained from various datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our segmentation algorithm. code and video are available at: https://github.com/meiguiz/sg-grasp.",AB_0132
"backgroundliterature regarding the advantages of gasless vnotes is insufficient. the aim of our study is to compare gasless vnotes vs. traditional vnotes on hemodynamic profiles and outcomes in patients with benign gynecological disease. we hypothesize that compared with those in the traditional vnotes group, hemodynamic profiles will be changed less during gasless vnotes, while safety can be promised.methodsthis is a single-center, prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial, which has been approved by the institutional review board of chengdu women's and children's hospital on september 27, 2022. one hundred and twenty patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the traditional vnotes group or the gasless vnotes group in a 1:1 ratio. for patients allocated to the traditional vnotes group, after insertion of one port through the vagina, co2 gas is infused with a pressure of 12-14 mmhg; while for those allocated to the gasless vnotes group, a special device is used as an abdominal wall-lifting device to facilitate gasless surgery. co2 pneumoperitoneum will not be used during the whole gasless vnotes procedure. the primary outcome is vital signs at different time points. the secondary outcomes include surgical conversion rate, duration of surgery and anesthesia, anesthetic consumption, intraoperative estimated blood loss, vas and ponv scores at postoperative 2 h and 24 h, administration of vasopressor drugs from the beginning of general anesthesia induction to 15 min after endotracheal intubation, including times, dosage, and type, intraoperative and postoperative complications, time of first getting out of bed after surgery, and time of first eating after surgery, including light drink.discussionthis is the first randomized controlled trial to compare the impacts of gasless vnotes vs. traditional vnotes on hemodynamic profiles and outcomes in patients with benign gynecological disease. if a favorable effect and safety of gasless vnotes for hemodynamic profiles and outcomes in patients are shown, gasless vnotes would be an optimal treatment option for patients with benign gynecological disease.trial registrationthe trial was registered at https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=182441 with registration no. chictr2200064779 on oct 17, 2022.",AB_0132
"backgrounddisrupted sleep is believed to contribute to short- and long-term neurodevelopmental problems in very preterm infants (vpis). this study presents a protocol for an evaluator-blinded, randomized crossover trial. it aims to assess the sleep efficiency of hospitalized vpis by providing multisensory stimulation bundles. furthermore, it aims to observe the intervention impacts on sleep during hospitalization of the vpis and their sleep and neurodevelopmental outcomes during the first year of post-discharge follow-up.methodsthe study will be conducted in the neonatology department of a tertiary pediatric teaching hospital. all the eligible vpis will undergo two types of care in random order: standard care (2 weeks) and standard care plus multisensory stimulation bundles, each lasting 2 weeks. a generated list of random numbers will be used for case sequence allocation. sleep outcomes will be evaluated using the actiwatch-2 actigraph. moreover, the amplitude-integrated electroencephalography and the griffiths mental development scales will be used to measure the neurodevelopmental outcomes during hospitalization and in the first year of follow-up of the vpis.discussionthe intervention protocol of this study differs from that of other traditional interventions by producing precise and consistent supportive stimulations, similar to maternal tactile, auditory, posture, and visual effects for hospitalized vpis. this protocol could be an effective measure to facilitate sleep and early neurodevelopment of vpis. the expected outcomes will help confirm the implementation and generalization of the multisensory stimulation bundles' care protocol in neonatology departments. we expect that the study will positively impact hospitalized vpis, especially in their sleep and early neurodevelopmental outcomes. it will also provide a new perspective regarding parent and infant interaction strategies, particularly for newborn intensive care units that limit visits because of the global spread of covid-19.trial registrationchinese clinical trial registry chictr 2200059099. registered on 25 april 2022, https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=166980; the hospital research ethics committee (approval number: scmcirb-k2021086-1, version 01), approved on 21 january 2022.",AB_0132

"indoor point clouds from real-world scans are often incomplete and sparse due to limited observation views and severe occlusion between objects. point cloud completion can restore missing parts to ensure data integrity, so that subsequent tasks like point cloud classification, segmentation, object detection and three-dimensional (3d) reconstruction can obtain more accurate and complete geometric and semantic information. existing point cloud completion methods focus more on synthetic data or require separate modeling on each class of objects, which struggle to meet the inherent requirements of the completion task for real-world indoor scenes containing multiclass objects with significant pose variations. in this research, we present an efficient class-conditional generative adversarial network (gan) inversion framework for the task of recovering incomplete objects in real-world indoor scenes, in which we first train a class-conditional gan to learn rich shape priors for multi-class objects from synthetic data domain and then find an optimal latent code in gan's latent space that gives a complete shape that best recovers the given incomplete input from real-world data domain. the performance of our proposed method is evaluated on both real-world and synthetic datasets. in comparison to shapeinversion (zhang et al., 2021), our method demonstrates an improvement in f-score by 3.7 and 2.0 percentage points while reducing the chamfer distance (cd) by 4.15 and 1.1 on scannet dataset and crn dataset, respectively. the developed code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/cnu-dlandcv-lab/cgan-inversion.",AB_0132
"in recent years, the transformer-based approach becoming a hot research topic in hyperspectral image (hsi) classification tasks. however, most of these studies have focused on optimizing the model framework in pursuit of high-accuracy classification, with little attention to the composition of the input token sequence as an important factor affecting the performance of the transformer. therefore, this paper further explores a novel token structure to strengthen the transformer's performance for hsi classification tasks, based on which a multi-range spectral-spatial transformer (mrsst) framework is developed. specifically, a convolutional feature pre-encoder with two branches is designed to extract shallow features for each spectral channel separately. then, a token generator is introduced to combine the shallow features with the raw spectral information to yield the token sequences with multi-range information. finally, the tokens are input into the transformer encoders enhanced by a module that strengthens the information exchange between its mid-range and short-range se-mantic features. experiments conducted on three well-known hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the pro-posed multi-range composite token sequences and information exchange mechanisms significantly enhance the transformer's performance. codes are released at: https://github.com/hypersystemandimageproc/multi-range-spectral-spatial-transformer.",AB_0132
"understanding the pathogenicity of missense mutation (mm) is essential for shed light on genetic diseases, gene functions, and individual variations. in this study, we propose a novel computational approach, called mmpatho, for enhancing missense mutation pathogenic prediction. first, we established a large-scale nonredundant mm benchmark data set based on the entire ensembl database, complemented by a focused blind test set specifically for pathogenic gof/lof mm. based on this data set, for each mutation, we utilized ensembl vep v104 and dbnsfp v4.1a to extract variant-level, amino acid-level, individuals' outputs, and genome-level features. additionally, protein sequences were generated using ensp identifiers with the ensembl api, and then encoded. the mutant sites' esm-1b and prottrans-t5 embeddings were subsequently extracted. then, our model group (mmpatho) was developed by leveraging upon these efforts, which comprised consmm and evoindmm. to be specific, consmm employs individuals' outputs and xgboost with shap explanation analysis, while evoindmm investigates the potential enhancement of predictive capability by incorporating evolutionary information from esm-1b and prott5-xl-u50, large protein language embeddings. through rigorous comparative experiments, both consmm and evoindmm were capable of achieving remarkable auroc (0.9836 and 0.9854) and aupr (0.9852 and 0.9902) values on the blind test set devoid of overlapping variations and proteins from the training data, thus highlighting the superiority of our computational approach in the prediction of mm pathogenicity. our web server, available at http://csbio.njust.edu.cn/bioinf/mmpatho/, allows researchers to predict the pathogenicity (alongside the reliability index score) of mms using the consmm and evoindmm models and provides extensive annotations for user input. additionally, the newly constructed benchmark data set and blind test set can be accessed via the data page of our web server.",AB_0132
"protein-protein interaction plays an important role in studying the mechanism of protein functions from the structural perspective. molecular docking is a powerful approach to detect protein-protein complexes using computational tools, due to the high cost and time-consuming of the traditional experimental methods. among existing technologies, the template-based method utilizes the structural information of known homologous 3d complexes as available and reliable templates to achieve high accuracy and low computational complexity. however, the performance of the template-based method depends on the quality and quantity of templates. when insufficient or even no templates, the ab initio docking method is necessary and largely enriches the docking conformations. therefore, it's a feasible strategy to fuse the effectivity of the template-based model and the universality of ab initio model to improve the docking performance. in this study, we construct a new, diverse, comprehensive template library derived from pdb, containing 77,685 complexes. we propose a template-based method (named temdock), which retrieves the evolutionary relationship between the target sequence and samples in the template library and transfers similar structural information. then, the target structure is built by superposing on the homologous template complex with tm-align. moreover, we develop a consensus-based method (named comdock) to integrate our temdock and an existing ab initio method (zdock). on 105 targets with templates from benchmark 5.0, the temdock and comdock achieve a success rate of 68.57 % and 71.43 % in the top 10 conformations, respectively. compared with the hdock, comdock obtains better irmsd of hit configurations on 9 targets and more hit models in the top 100 conformations. as an efficient method for protein-protein docking, the comdock is expected to study protein-protein recognition and reveal the various biological passways that are critical for developing drug discovery. the final results are stored at https://github.com/guofei-tju/mqz_comdock_docking.",AB_0132
