"we present finite-element numerical algorithms for the identification of vortices in quantum fluids described by a macroscopic complex wave function. their implementation using the free software freefem++ is distributed with this paper as a post-processing toolbox that can be used to analyse numerical or experimental data. applications for bose-einstein condensates (bec) and superfluid helium flows are presented. programs are tested and validated using either numerical data obtained by solving the gross-pitaevskii equation or experimental images of rotating bec. vortex positions are computed as topological defects (zeros) of the wave function when numerical data are used. for experimental images, we compute vortex positions as local minima of the atomic density, extracted after a simple image processing. once vortex centers are identified, we use a fit with a gaussian to precisely estimate vortex radius. for vortex lattices, the lattice parameter (inter-vortex distance) is also computed. the post-processing toolbox offers a complete description of vortex configurations in superfluids. tests for two-dimensional (giant vortex in rotating bec, abrikosov vortex lattice in experimental bec) and three-dimensional (vortex rings, kelvin waves and quantum turbulence fields in superfluid helium) configurations show the robustness of the software. the communication with programs providing the numerical or experimental wave function field is simple and intuitive. the post-processing toolbox can be also applied for the identification of vortices in superconductors.program summaryprogram title: ffem_postproc_data_2d, ffem_postproc_data_3d and ffem_postproc_imagecpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /bhrtdbkxmy.1licensing provisions: apache 2.0programming language: freefem++ (v 4.12) free software (www.freefem .org)nature of problem: the software is scoped to the identification of quantized vortices in 2d or 3d configurations described by a complex wave function. either simulation data obtained through numerical resolution of the gross-pitaevskii equation or 2d experimental images of bose-einstein condensates (bec) can be used as input data. examples of vortex identification in rotating becs and superfluid helium are illustrated in the paper.solution method: we model the complex wave function using p1 (piece-wise linear) galerkin triangular (in 2d) and tetrahedral (in 3d) finite elements. for simulation data, the zeros of the wave function are directly computed and the circulation of the velocity on triangles sides is assessed. vortices are obtained when a zero is found in a triangle with non-zero circulation. in 3d, the algorithm is applied on tetrahedron faces and the zero points are linked using mesh connectivity to form vortex lines. for experimental images, vortices are identified as local minima of the atomic density and extracted using the image contrast.",AB_0053
"the optical flow (of) estimation is an important but challenging task used in various computer vision applications. recently, the introduction of deep learning models has resulted in a veritable paradigm shift. however, such an approach can be biased towards the specific training data, which can lead to a considerable inaccuracy of the estimated of in real world applications. this paper proposes a novel benchmark that can be used to identify and measure different biases of deep learning models for of estimation. the benchmark focuses on testing the network equivariance, i.e. the model capability to handle data transformations. we have performed experiments based on public datasets to (1) investigate to what extent the state-of-the-art networks lack spatial equivariance when reflections are applied to the data; (2) propose new metrics and a methodology to assess the phenomenon; and (3) benchmark the state-of-the-art optical estimators and their core components for equivariance. the results show that some state-of-the-art deep learning techniques present a substantial degree of bias towards certain directions of motion. the proposed framework can help researchers and practitioners to develop more effective models for of estimation. the testing and training scripts provided at https://github.com/stsavian/benchmarking_equivariance_for_of_estimators can be used to evaluate and compare different models for of estimation.",AB_0053
"the robot behavior strategy is considered as a crucial part in the human-following task to help the robot maintain an appropriate distance and orientation to the selected target person (stp) with a smooth and safe manner. as usual, the robot is uniquely considered to follow the stp in a specific class of environments, such as unknown environments (non-mapped environments) or known environments (mapped environments). however, in real-life applications, the robot is sometimes requested to follow the stp in various types of environments, both in known and unknown ones. this observation raises the need to propose an alternative method to challenge the mentioned issue, as well as to break the current limit of the human-following function. in this paper, a new approach for the human-following strategy is proposed in which the mobile robot is enabled to follow the stp in mixed environments (non-mapped and mapped). in non-mapped environments, only the stp and the obstacle information with respect to the robot local coordinates are considered, whose purpose is to make the robot work without any prior understandings about its working environment. however, after the robot entered mapped environments, its prior knowledge of the working environment is leveraged to fulfill some additional requirements during the cooperation, such as the mobile robot in factories is not allowed to enter some specific areas even when the stp is executing technical tasks inside. additionally, in this paper, a human-like inference mechanism is also introduced for the human-following strategy by using an extended hedge algebras. the proposed method is experimentally verified both in factories and laboratories.demo video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrwu6ldkuw since real videos in the factory are not allowed to publish, only visualization (in rviz) is presented for demos in such kinds of environments. the visualization is synchronous with the real executions of the human-robot interactions. the robot used in the factory is an autonomous mobile robot (dimension 0.5 (m) x1.0 (m), weight 120 (kg), carrying a tool cabinet around 300(kg))). the mobile robot is following the worker to support them during the technical processes in the car production line. in the video, the robot is represented by a green rectangular, and the stp is represented by a cylinder (with a sphere on its head) the events in the demo video are described more clearly in appendix a.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0053
"it has been observed in different kinds of networks, such as social or biological ones, a typical behavior inspired by the general principle 'similarity breeds connections'. these networks are defined as homophilic as nodes belonging to the same class preferentially interact with each other. in this work, we present honto (homophily network tool), a user-friendly open-source python3 package designed to evaluate and analyze homophily in complex networks. the tool takes in input from the network along with a partition of its nodes into classes and yields a matrix whose entries are the homophily/heterophily z-score values. to complement the analysis, the tool also provides z-score values of nodes that do not interact with any other node of the same class. homophily/heterophily z-scores values are presented as a heatmap allowing a visual at-a-glance interpretation of results. availability and implementation: tool's source code is available at https://github.com/cumbof/honto under the mit license, installable as a package from pypi (pip install honto) and conda-forge (conda install -c conda-forge honto), and has a wrapper for the galaxy platform available on the official galaxy toolshed () at https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/fabio/honto. contact: paolo.franciosa@uniroma1.",AB_0053
"motivation : comparing single-stranded nucleic acids (ssnas) secondary structures is fundamental when investigating their function and evolution and predicting the effect of mutations on their structures. many comparison metrics exist, although they are either too elaborate or not sensitive enough to distinguish close ssnas structures. results: in this context, we developed aptamat, a simple and sensitive algorithm for ssnas secondary structures comparison based on matrices representing the ssnas secondary structures and a metric built upon the manhattan distance in the plane. we applied aptamat to several examples and compared the results to those obtained by the most frequently used metrics, namely the hamming distance and the rnadistance, and by a recently developed image-based approach. we showed that aptamat is able to discriminate between similar sequences, outperforming all the other here considered metrics. in addition, we showed that aptamat was able to correctly classify 14 rfam families within a clustering procedure. availability and implementation : the python code for aptamat is available at https://github.com/gec-git/aptamat.git. contact: irene.maffucci@utc.fr or miraine.davila-felipe@utc.fr supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0053
"although convolutional neural networks (cnns) have advanced to demonstrate superior performance in image classification tasks that often surpass human capability, the feature space of cnns, which are trained using a typical training method, is limited by the smaller-than-expected inter-class variances. consequently, cnns are prone to misclassifying adversarial examples with high confidence, and the difference between an adversarial example and a normal input is indistinguishable by human beings. to alleviate this problem, we propose a training methodology that defends against adversarial attacks through a constraint that applies a class-specific differentiation to the feature space of cnns. the proposed methodology first forces the feature representations that corresponding to each class to be localized on the hypersphere surface with a particular radius. the forced representation is then trained to be located as close to the center of the hypersphere as possible, resulting in feature representations with a small intra-class variance and large inter-class variances. the experimental results reveal that the proposed two-step training method enhances defense performance by 17.1%p and demonstrates a training speed of up to 30 times faster than the existing distance-based adversarial defense methodology. the code is available at: https://github.com/lepoeme20/cost-free-adversarial-defense",AB_0053
"the accurate prediction of cancer drug sensitivity according to the multiomics profiles of individual patients is crucial for precision cancer medicine. however, the development of prediction models has been challenged by the complex crosstalk of input features and the resistance -dominant drug response information contained in public databases. in this study, we propose a novel multidrug response prediction framework, response -aware multitask prediction (ramp), via a bayesian neural network and restrict it by soft -supervised contrastive regularization. to utilize network embedding vectors as representation learning features for heterogeneous networks, we harness response -aware negative sampling, which applies cell line-drug response information to the training of network embeddings. ramp overcomes the prediction accuracy limitation induced by the imbalance of trained response data based on the comprehensive selection and utilization of drug response features. when trained on the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer dataset, ramp achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve > 89%, an area under the precision -recall curve > 59% and an fi score > 52% and outperformed previously developed methods on both balanced and imbalanced datasets. furthermore, ramp predicted many missing drug responses that were not included in the public databases. our results showed that ramp will be suitable for the high -throughput prediction of cancer drug sensitivity and will be useful for guiding cancer drug selection processes. the python implementation for ramp is available at https://github.com/hvc1/ramp.",AB_0053
"structure prediction of protein-ligand complexes, called protein-ligand docking, is a critical computational technique that can be used to understand the underlying principle behind the protein functions at the atomic level and to design new molecules regulating the functions. protein-ligand docking methods have been employed in structure-based drug discovery for hit discovery and lead optimization. one of the important technical challenges in protein-ligand docking is to account for protein conformational changes induced by ligand binding. a small change such as a single side-chain rotation upon ligand binding can hinder accurate docking. here we report an increase in docking performance achieved by structure alignment to known complex structures. first, a fully flexible compound-to-compound alignment method csalign is developed by global optimization of a shape score. next, the alignment method is combined with a docking algorithm to dock a new ligand to a target protein when a reference protein-ligand complex structure is available. this alignment-based docking method, called csalign-dock, showed superior performance to ab initio docking methods in cross-docking benchmark tests. both csalign and csalign-dock are freely available as a web server at https://galaxy.seoklab.org/csalign.

"semantic parsing is a challenging task mapping a natural language utterance to machine-understandable information representation. recently, approaches using neural machine translation (nmt) have achieved many promising results, especially the transformer. however, the typical drawback of adapting the vanilla transformer to semantic parsing is that it does not consider the phrase in expressing the information of sentences while phrases play an important role in constructing the sentence meaning. therefore, we propose an architecture, phrasetransformer, that is capable of a more detailed meaning representation by learning the phrase dependencies in the sentence. the main idea is to incorporate long short-term memory into the self-attention mechanism of the original transformer to capture the local context of a word. experimental results show that our proposed model performs better than the original transformer in terms of understanding sentences structure as well as logical representation and raises the model local context-awareness without any support from external tree information. besides, although the recurrent architecture is integrated, the number of sequential operations of the phrasetransformer is still o(1) similar to the original transformer. our proposed model achieves strong competitive performance on geo and mspars datasets, and leads to sota performance on the atis dataset for methods using neural networks. in addition, to prove the generalization of our proposed model, we also conduct extensive experiments on three translation datasets iwlst14 german-english, iwslt15 vietnamese-english, wmt14 english-german, and show significant improvement. our code is available at https://github.com/phuongnm94/phrasetransformer.git.",AB_0053
"an increasing amount of captured images are streamed to a remote server or stored in a device for deep neural network (dnn) inference. in most cases, raw images are compressed with encoding algorithms such as jpeg to cope with resource limitations. however, the standard jpeg optimized for human visual systems may induce significant accuracy loss in dnn inference tasks. in addition, the standard jpeg com-presses all regions in an image at the same quality level, while some areas may not contain valuable information for the target task. in this paper, we propose a target-driven jpeg compression framework that performs region-adaptive quantization of the dct coefficients. the region-based quality map is gen-erated from an end-to-end trainable neural network. in addition, we present a deep learning approach to remove the requirement of storing the overhead information induced by the region-based encoding pro-cess. our framework can be easily implemented on devices with commonly used jpeg and also produce images that achieve a higher compression rate with minimum degradation of the classification accuracy. the codes are available at https://github.com/jshye/qf- map-generator .(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0053
