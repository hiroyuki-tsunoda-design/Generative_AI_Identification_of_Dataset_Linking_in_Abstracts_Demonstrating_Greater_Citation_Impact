"esrgan is a generative adversarial network that produces visually pleasing super-resolution (sr) images with high perceptual quality from low-resolution images. however, it frequently fails to recover local details, resulting in blurry or unnatural visual artifacts. to address this problem, we propose using an additional perceptual loss (computed using the pretrained pieapp network) for training the generator, adding skip connections to the discriminator to use a combination of features with different scales, and replacing the leaky relu activation functions in the discriminator with the relu ones. through x4 sr experiments utilizing real and computer-generated image benchmark datasets, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can produce sr images with significantly higher perceptual quality than esrgan and other esrgan enhancements. specifically, when compared to esrgan, the proposed method resulted in 5.95 higher dmos values, 0.46 lower pi values, and 0.01 lower lpips values. the source code is accessible at https://github.com/cyun-404/pieesrgan.",AB_0057
"lysine crotonylation (kcr) is one of the most important post-translational modifications (ptms) that is widely detected in both histone and non-histone proteins. in fact, kcr is reported to be involved in various biological processes, such as metabolism and cell differentiation. however, the available experimental methods for kcr site identification are laborious and costly. to effectively replace existing experimental approaches, some computational methods have been developed in the last few years. the available computational methods still lack some important aspects, as they can only identify kcr sites on either histone-only or combined histone and nonhistone proteins. although a tool was developed to identify kcr sites on non-histone proteins only, its performance is inadequate and the exploration of hidden kcr patterns (motifs) has been completely ignored, which might be significant for detailed kcr studies. therefore, algorithms that can more effectively predict kcr sites on non-histone proteins with their biological meaning need to be designed. accordingly, we developed a novel deep learning (capsule network)-based model, named capsnh-kcr, for kcr site prediction, particularly focusing on nonhistone proteins. based on the independent results, the proposed model achieves an auc of 0.9120, which is approximately 6% higher than that of previous nhkcr model in the prediction of kcr sites on nonhistone proteins. further, we revealed, for the first time, that the proposed model can represent obvious motif distribution across kcr sites in non-histone proteins. the source code (in python) is publicly available at https://github.com/jhabindra-bioinfo/capsnh-kcr.

"for researchers and psychologists interested in estimating a subject's memory capacity, the current standard for scoring memory span tasks is the partial-credit method: subjects are credited with the number of stimuli that they manage to recall correctly in the correct serial position. a critical issue with this method, however, is that intrusions and omissions can radically change the scores depending on where they occur. for example, when recalling the sequence abcde, abcd is worth 4 points but bcde is worth 0 points. this paper presents an improved scoring method based on the edit distance, meaning the number of changes required to edit the recalled sequence into the target. edit-distance scoring gives results close to partial-credit scoring, but without the corresponding vulnerability to positional shifts. a reanalysis of memory performance in two large datasets (n= 1093 and n= 758) confirms that in addition to being more logically consistent, edit-distance scoring demonstrates similar or better psychometric properties than partial-credit, with comparable validity, a small increase in reliability, and a substantial increase of test information (measurement precision in the context of item response theory). test information was especially improved for harder items and for subjects with ability in the lower range, whose scores tend to be severely underestimated by partial-credit scoring. code to compute edit-distance scores with various software is made available at https://osf.io/wdb83/.",AB_0057
"in existing deep clustering methods, it is assumed that all generated representations are equally important during the clustering procedure. however, if the model can't learn proper cluster-oriented representations, all generated representations may not be suitable for clustering. in this case, some important representations need to be more effective than the other representations in forming optimal clusters. the existing deep clustering methods do not support this idea. also, in most methods, kullback-leibler divergence (kld) loss function is used. kld does not preserve global data structure. in this paper, an efficient joint deep clustering framework, termed edcwrn, is introduced to learn representations and cluster labels, simultaneously. to overcome the mentioned problems, in edcwrn, an automatic local representation weighting strategy is applied to weight the representations of each cluster properly. moreover, the samples and their neighbors are involved in the learning representations procedure to generate better representation. also, a new efficient formulation for cluster assignments is proposed. using this formulation, global and local data structure is preserved simultaneously. experiments show that the proposed model is more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. the implementation-source code- of edcwrn is made publicly available at https://github.com/ amin-golzari-oskouei/edcwrn.",AB_0057
"it was more than 45 years ago that gunnar johansson invented the point-light display technique. this showed for the first time that kinematics is crucial for action recognition, and that humans are very sensitive to their conspecifics' movements. as a result, many of today's researchers use point-light displays to better understand the mechanisms behind this recognition ability. in this paper, we propose plavimop, a new database of 3d point-light displays representing everyday human actions (global and fine-motor control movements), sports movements, facial expressions, interactions, and robotic movements. access to the database is free, at https://plavimop.prd.fr/en/motions. moreover, it incorporates a search engine to facilitate action retrieval. in this paper, we describe the construction, functioning, and assessment of the plavimop database. each sequence was analyzed according to four parameters: type of movement, movement label, sex of the actor, and age of the actor. we provide both the mean scores for each assessment of each point-light display, and the comparisons between the different categories of sequences. our results are discussed in the light of the literature and the suitability of our stimuli for research and applications.",AB_0057
"emotion recognition from face images is a challenging task that gained interest in recent years for its applications to business intelligence and social robotics. researchers in computer vision and affective computing focused on optimizing the classification error on benchmark data sets, which do not extensively cover possible variations that face images may undergo in real environments. following on investigations carried out in the field of object recognition, we evaluated the robustness of existing methods for emotion recognition when their input is subjected to corruptions caused by factors present in real-world scenarios. we constructed two data sets on top of the raf-db test set, named raf-db-c and raf-db-p, that contain images modified with 18 types of corruption and 10 of perturbation. we benchmarked existing networks (vgg, densenet, senet and xception) trained on the original images of raf-db and compared them with arm, the current state-of-the-art method on the raf-db test set. we carried out an extensive study on the effects that modifications to the training data or network architecture have on the classification of corrupted and perturbed data. we observed a drop of recognition performance of arm, with the classification error raising up to 200% of that achieved on the original raf-db test set. we demonstrate that the use of the autoaugment data augmentation and an anti-aliasing filter within down-sampling layers provide existing networks with increased robustness to out-of-distribution variations, substantially reducing the error on corrupted inputs and outperforming arm. we provide insights about the resilience of existing emotion recognition methods and an estimation of their performance in real scenarios. the processing time required by the modifications we investigated (35 ms in the worst case) supports their suitability for application in real-world scenarios. the raf-db-c and rafdb-p test sets, trained models and evaluation framework are available at https://github.com/mivialab/emotion-robustness.",AB_0057
"to improve the security and reliability of wind energy production, short-term forecasting has become of utmost importance. this study focuses on multi-step spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting for the norwegian continental shelf. in particular, the study considers 14 offshore measurement stations and aims to leverage spatial dependencies through the relative physical location of different stations to improve local wind forecasts and simultaneously output different forecasts for each of the 14 locations. our multi-step forecasting models produce either 10-minute, 1-or 4-hour forecasts, with 10-minute resolution, meaning that the models produce more informative time series for predicted future trends. a graph neural network (gnn) architecture was used to extract spatial dependencies, with different update functions to learn temporal correlations. these update functions were implemented using different neural network architectures. one such architecture, the transformer, has become increasingly popular for sequence modelling in recent years. various alterations have been proposed to better facilitate time series forecasting, of which this study focused on the informer, logsparse transformer and autoformer. this is the first time the logsparse transformer and autoformer have been applied to wind forecasting and the first time any of these or the informer have been formulated in a spatio-temporal setting for wind forecasting. by comparing against spatio-temporal long short-term memory (lstm) and multi-layer perceptron (mlp) models, the study showed that the models using the altered transformer architectures as update functions in gnns were able to outperform these. furthermore, we propose the fast fourier transformer (fftransformer), which is a novel transformer architecture based on signal decomposition and consists of two separate streams that analyse the trend and periodic components separately. the fftransformer and autoformer were found to achieve superior results for the 10-minute and 1-hour ahead forecasts, with the fftransformer significantly outperforming all other models for the 4-hour ahead forecasts. our code to implement the different models are made publicly available at: https://github.com/larsbentsen/fftransformer.",AB_0057
"the analysis of the combined mrna and mirna content of a biological sample can be of interest for answering several research questions, like biomarkers discovery, or mrna-mirna interactions. however, the process is costly and time-consuming, separate libraries need to be prepared and sequenced on different flowcells. combo-seq is a library prep kit that allows us to prepare combined mrna-mirna libraries starting from very low total rna. to date, no dedicated bioinformatics method exists for the processing of combo-seq data. in this paper, we describe coda (combo-seq data analysis), a workflow specifically developed for the processing of combo-seq data that employs existing free -to -use tools. we compare coda with excerpt, the pipeline suggested by the kit manufacturer for this purpose. we also evaluate how combo-seq libraries analysed with coda perform compared with conventional poly(a) and small rna libraries prepared from the same samples. we show that using coda more successfully trimmed reads are recovered compared with excerpt, and the difference is more dramatic with short sequencing reads. we demonstrate how combo-seq identifies as many genes and fewer mirnas compared to the standard libraries, and how mirna validation favours conventional small rna libraries over combo-seq. the coda code is available at https://github.com/marta-nazzari/coda.",AB_0057
"object detection problem-solving has witnessed vast developments in the past few years. there is a need for lighter models in cases where hardware limitations exist, together with a demand for models to be designed to run on mobile devices. this paper assesses methods used for algorithms which are created to address these issues. the main goal of this article is to improve accuracy in state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining speed and real-time efficiency. small objects and inaccurate localization are the main issues in one-stage object detection. to resolve these issues, in this paper, a new network entitled mobiledensenetwas created, which is suitable for embedded systems. we also developed a light neck, called fcpnlitefor mobile devices, which facilitates the detection of small objects. our research suggests that necks in embedded systems have been sporadically mentioned by the existing studies. the novelty of our network lies in the use of concatenation features. a small yet significant change to the head of the network improved accuracy without increasing speed or limiting parameters. overall, the accuracy of our method on the challenging coco and pascal voc datasets were 24.8 and 76.8 percentage, respectively. this has been by far the highest rate recorded by other state-of-the-art systems. our network has the capability to increase accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency in mobile devices. we calculated the operating speed on pixel 3 (snapdragon 845) at 22.8 fps. the source code of this research is available on https://github.com/hajizadeh/mobiledensenet.",AB_0057
"a plethora of proteomics search engine output file formats are in circulation. this lack of standardized output files greatly complicates generic downstream processing of peptide-spectrum matches (psms) and psm files. while standards exist to solve this problem, these are far from universally supported by search engines. moreover, software libraries are available to read a selection of psm file formats, but a package to parse psm files into a unified data structure has been missing. here, we present psm_utils, a python package to read and write various psm file formats and to handle peptidoforms, psms, and psm lists in a unified and user-friendly python-, command line-, and web-interface. psm_utils was developed with pragmatism and maintainability in mind, adhering to community standards and relying on existing packages where possible. the python api and command line interface greatly facilitate handling various psm file formats. moreover, a user-friendly web application was built using psm_utils that allows anyone to interconvert psm files and retrieve basic psm statistics. psm_utils is freely available under the permissive apache2 license at https://github.com/compomics/psm_utils.",AB_0057
