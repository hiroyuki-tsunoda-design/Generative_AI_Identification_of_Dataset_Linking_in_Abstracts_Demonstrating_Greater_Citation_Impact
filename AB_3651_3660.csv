"the product categories are vital for the e-commerce platforms due to the core applications on auto-matic product category assignment, personalized product recommendations, etc. in this paper, we con-struct a large-scale multi-modal e-commerce products classification dataset mep-3m, which is large-scale, hierarchical-categorized, multi-modal, fine-grained, and long-tailed. statistically, mep-3m consists of over 3 million products, thus achieves the largest data scale in comparison to the existing e-commerce product datasets. the products in mep-3m are represented in three modalities: image, textual descrip-tion, and ocr text, and labeled with tree-like labels. the third level labels are extremely fine-grained. in addition, we exploit four novel practical tasks on this dataset, product classification, hierarchical product classification, fine-grained product classification, and product representation learning. for each task, we present some image-only, text-only, and multi-modal baseline performances for further researches. the mep-3m dataset will be released at https://github.com/chendelong1999/mep-3m . ?? 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0366
"single image deraining (sid) is a challenging problem since the rainy images contain a variety of backgrounds with rain streaks of different directions and densities. though previous convolutional neural network based methods for sid have shown promising performance, their characterization ability is limited as they suffer from the local receptive fields and ignore long-range dependencies. some methods try to solve it by designing complicated network architectures, which yields high computational costs. to address these problems, we consider both local and global features in the proposed recurrent attention-distilling network (radn). specifically, in the shallow layer, the local contextual information is extracted by a local extract module with channel and pixel attention blocks to focus on features of important channels and spatial locations. in the deep layer, the global intrinsic features are characterized by a refined transformer block with a self-attention (sa) mechanism to capture the long-range dependencies. meanwhile, a teacher network is pre-trained by a rain-to-rain mapping to supervise the proposed radn learning the rain intrinsic features quicker with lightweight. moreover, we propose a direction-enhanced contrastive learning (decl) strategy which incorporates the potential rainy images into negative contrastive pairs to improve the model generalization ability. extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve a competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods on both real and synthetic datasets. the source code is available at https://github.com/meky-hqd/radn.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0366
"in this paper, we develop a novel regularization method for deep neural networks by penalizing the trace of hessian. this regularizer is motivated by a recent guarantee bound of the generalization error. we explain its benefits in finding flat minima and avoiding lyapunov stability in dynamical systems. we adopt the hutchinson method as a classical unbiased estimator for the trace of a matrix and further accel-erate its calculation using a dropout scheme. experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing regularizers and data augmentation methods, such as jacobian, confidence penalty, label smoothing, cutout, and mixup. the code is available at https://github.com/dean-lyc/hessian-regularization.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0366
"generalized zero-shot learning aims to classify samples of seen and unseen classes by providing only the labels of seen classes. most gzsl methods directly associate seen classes' visual features with semantic information or leverage semantic information to synthesize samples of unseen classes to transfer the knowledge of seen classes to unseen classes. however, existing generative methods simply employ visual features extracted from the per-trained cnn backbone, which overlooks that the visual features of similar categories have significant similarities and lack enough discriminating information, leading to poor clas-sification performance when generalizing the knowledge of seen classes to unseen classes. to mitigate this issue, we present a visual-semantic consistency matching network (vscm) for generalized zero -shot learning. our proposed method employs a conditional vae to generate the visual features of unseen classes and utilizes a visual-semantic consistency matching network that aligns visual space with seman-tic space to obtain visual-semantic consistency features. specifically, we propose a semantic chunking network that teams up with semantic attention and a semantic encoder to guide the visual-semantic con-sistency matching network to get synthetic semantic information aligned with factual semantic informa-tion. the semantic relation network guarantees the consistency between the factual semantic information and the block features, while the semantic independence network measures the indepen-dence of the blocks. finally, we concatenate visual features and synthetic semantic information as visual-semantic consistency features to improve the separability between categories. extensive experi-ments on five gzsl benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant generalization performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods. our codes have been available at:https://github.-com/zzq158/vscm-gzsl.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0366
"person search aims to simultaneously localize and identify a query person from uncropped images. to achieve this goal, state-of-the-art models typically add a re-id branch upon two-stage detectors like faster r-cnn. owing to the roi-align operation, this pipeline yields promising accuracy as re-id features are explicitly aligned with the corresponding object regions, but in the meantime, it introduces high computational overhead due to dense object anchors. in this work, we present an anchor-free approach to efficiently tackling this challenging task, by introducing the following dedicated designs. first, we select an anchor-free detector (i.e., fcos) as the prototype of our framework. due to the lack of dense object anchors, it exhibits significantly higher efficiency compared with existing person search models. second, when directly accommodating this anchor-free detector for person search, there exist several misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task). to address these issues, we propose an aligned feature aggregation module to generate more discriminative and robust feature embeddings. accordingly, we name our framework as feature-aligned person search network (alignps). third, by investigating the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free models, we further augment alignps with an roi-align head, which significantly improves the robustness of re-id features while still keeping our model highly efficient. our framework not only achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on two challenging person search benchmarks, but can be also extended to other challenging searching tasks such as animal and object search. all the source codes, data, and trained models are available at: https://github.com/daodaofr/alignps.",AB_0366
"when solving practical optimization problems bymetaheuristic algorithms (mas), an important issue is how to balance exploration and exploitation. this article develops a novel hybrid grasshopper optimization algorithm (hgoa) to solve the above issue. inhgoa, an enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm with the nonlinear control parameter and a modified butterfly optimization algorithm with the dynamic inertia weight are hybridized based on the probabilistic selection mechanism. then the centroid opposition-based learning method is utilized to select the best solution between the original individual and its opposite solution. furthermore, we introduce a self-adaptive pattern search technique as a local search engine to reinforce the exploitation capacity of the algorithm. the comparison of the proposed method on several benchmark problems and five engineering optimization issues with selected state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates that the developed method performs competitively and effectively. the source code of hgoa is publicly available at https:// github. com/denglingyun123/a-novel- hybrid-grasshopper-optimization- algorithm.",AB_0366
"due to the memorization effect of deep neural networks, training with noisy labels typically results in performance degradation. existing methods have devoted numerous effort s to training a robust model. however, rare literature pays attention to deep metric learning in the presence of label noise due to the challenge of discriminating between noisy examples and informative (hard) ones. to this end, we propose a simple yet effective approach co-mining to build a robust and discriminative feature space. specifically, more confident yet fewer instances are selected to guarantee the label quality and make up a relatively reliable gallery for exploring under-exploited patterns. considering that some unex-pected noisy instances are inevitably registered as clean ones as training progresses, we make a trade-off between cleanliness and informativeness. a triplet loss, pulling positive pairs closer and pushing negative pairs apart, is imposed on semi-hard samples rather than the hardest counterparts. lastly, our method employs a threshold to distinguish out-of-distribution noisy images and discards them directly. we also use a re-ranking strategy for in-distribution noisy data to correct corrupted labels based on their consistently high predicted probabilities. comprehensive experiments on various syn-thetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our co-mining. code is available at https://github.com/nust- machine- intelligence- laboratory/co-mining .(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0366
"the high cost of data labeling often results in node label shortage in real applications. to improve node classification accuracy, graph-based semi-supervised learning leverages the ample unlabeled nodes to train together with the scarce available labeled nodes. however, most existing methods require the information of all nodes, including those to be predicted, during model training, which is not practical for dynamic graphs with newly added nodes. to address this issue, an adversarially regularized graph attention model is proposed to classify newly added nodes in a partially labeled graph. an attention -based aggregator is designed to generate the representation of a node by aggregating information from its neighboring nodes, thus naturally generalizing to previously unseen nodes. in addition, adversarial training is employed to improve the model's robustness and generalization ability by enforcing node representations to match a prior distribution. experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. the code is available at https://github.com/jiarenx/again.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0366
"graph-based multi-view clustering, with its ability to mine potential associations between data samples, has attracted extensive attention. however, existing methods directly learn affinity graphs from multiple feature views without removing noisy information mixed with the original data, resulting in limited performance. in addition, only shared information is included in the graph fusion process, which excludes inconsistent information, resulting in insufficient exploration of complemen-tary information among multi-view data. in this study, we propose an inclusivity-induced adaptive graph learning (iiagl) method to address these issues. first, inclusivity is defined as the capability of a view to accommodate other views. specifically, we extended subspace learning to graph construction, enabling view-specific graphs to capture the underlying data distribution. furthermore, an inclusivity-induced regularizer is introduced to guide graph rebuilding and graph fusion, and the entire process is performed using a self-weighted strategy. in this manner, we can obtain a clean consensus containing shared representations and complementary information from different views. an alternating direction method with augmented lagrangian multiplier (adm-alm) was designed to solve the resulting optimization problem. extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrated that the clustering performance of the proposed method outperformed that of other state-of-the-art methods. the source code for this study is publicly available at https://github.com/ryan-xinzou/iiagl-mc.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0366
"lesion segmentation algorithms automatically outline lesion areas in medical images, facilitating more effective identification and assessment of the clinically relevant features, and improving the efficacy and diagnosis accuracy. however, most fully convolutional network based segmentation methods suf-fer from spatial and contextual information loss when decreasing image resolution. to overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a skin lesion segmentation model, namely, the multi-scale contex-tual attention network (msca-net), which can exploit the multi-scale contextual information in im-ages. inspired by the skip connection of u-net, we design a multi-scale bridge (msb) module which interacts with multi-scale features to effectively fuse the multi-scale contextual information of the en-coder and decoder path features. we further propose a global-local channel spatial attention module (gl-csam), aiming at capturing global contextual information. in addition, to take full advantage of the multi-scale features of the decoder, we propose a scale-aware deep supervision (sads) module to achieve hierarchical iterative deep supervision. comprehensive experimental results on the public dataset of isic 2017, isic 2018, and ph2 show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in skin lesion segmentation. our code is available at https://github.com/yonghengsun1997/msca-net .
