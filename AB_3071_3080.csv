"background: shr8554 is a novel mu-opioid receptor-biased agonist. it has analgesic effects by selectively activating the g protein-coupled pathway. additionally, it can weakly activate the beta-arrestin-2 pathway, resulting in a limited number of side effects, such as gastrointestinal inhibition. previous studies have shown that shr8554 has good analgesic effects, safety and tolerability, but the pharmacokinetic characteristics of shr8554 in humans have not been reported. this study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of shr8554 in healthy chinese male subjects.methods: a single 1 mg/41.3 mu ci intravenous dose of [c-14]shr8554 was administered to six healthy male subjects. blood, urine and faecal samples were collected at continuous time points to analyse shr8554 parent drug levels and their metabolites. the total radioactivity in blood, plasma, urine and faeces was detected by using a liquid scintillation counter. the dynamic changes of shr8554 and its metabolite concentration were by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc/ms), and then pharmacokinetic analysis. the safety of the drug on the subjects was also observed after a single intravenous injection.results: the total recovery of radioactivity in urine and faeces was 99.68% +/- 0.79% in 216 h, including 76.22% +/- 1.12% in urine and 23.46% +/- 1.36% in faeces. seventeen major metabolites in blood, urine and faeces were analysed and identified. the main metabolic pathways of shr8554 in the human body involve 1) n-dealkylation; 2) o-deethylation; 3) mono-oxidation; 4) glucuronidation, etc. the primary mechanism of shr8554 clearance in the human body is through urinary excretion, primarily in its parent drug and metabolite forms. the drug has good safety, and no serious adverse effects were observed.conclusion: shr8554 showed favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety profiles in this study. shr8554 is extensively metabolized in human body. the main metabolic pathways include n-dealkylation and o-deethylation, as well as mono-oxidation and glucuronidation. the main excretion route of shr8554 and its metabolites is through urine.clinical trial registration: http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/, identifier ctr20220450",AB_0308
"amidst the rapid propagation of images across social media platforms, the representation learning of social images has emerged as a prime research pursuit. a salient characteristic of social images lies in their multimodal properties, encompassing the visual content and textual descriptions present within individual images and the social relationships among different images. notably, the content information within individual images and the structural information among different images exhibit a hierarchical nature. however, existing endeavors generally employ a flat framework, leading to suboptimal utilization of hierarchical relationships. furthermore, the heterogeneity inherent in data content and structural information presents additional challenges in social image representation. in light of these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural network model for social image representation learning, dubbed hhgsi. our motivation lies in exploring and exploiting the hierarchical relationship between diverse modalities through designing the hierarchical heterogeneous network framework. hhgsi consists of an intra-node multimodal graph encoder and an inter-node heterogeneous graph neural network to simultaneously capture fine-grained correlation within the image and heterogeneous relationships among the images. moreover, a task-independent optimization objective is designed to make the model suitable for numerous network-oriented and multimodal tasks. our proposal is extensively evaluated over four real-world datasets, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal. our code is publicly available in https://github.com/multimodal-code/hhgsi.(c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v.",AB_0308
"existing industrial visual anomaly detection models can be broadly categorized into two paradigms, i.e., the paradigm based on image reconstruction and the paradigm based on implicit feature modeling. while both of them have demonstrated great performance in detecting low-level structural anomalies, their limited adjustability and ability to detect high-level logical anomalies hinder their broader use in industrial visual inspection. to solve the above issues, this paper proposes a novel paradigm, that is, component-aware anomaly detection (comad), which can simultaneously achieve adjustable and logical anomaly detection. specifically, it segments the original image into diverse components, enabling model adjustability based on components' significance and long-range modeling capabilities based on components' metrological characteristics. we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can be realized by a lightweight and nearly training-free framework. comad is evaluated on real-world scenarios to show its adjustability and logical anomaly detection capabilities. it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging mvtec loco ad and cad-sd benchmarks. code is available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/comad.",AB_0308
"given the increasing diversity of available remote sensing data sources, multimodal fusion land cover classification has emerged as a promising direction in the community of earth observation. however, modern supervised multimodal deep learning methods heavily rely on extensive amounts of human-annotated training data. to address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised method for multimodal remote sensing land-cover type clustering: transformer-based multimodal prototypical contrastive clustering (tmpcc). it is based on three core designs. first, we design a multimodal transformer that learns a shared space through adaptive interactions between and within modalities. second, we introduce an online clustering mechanism based on unified prototype learning that is scalable to large-scale multimodal datasets. third, we employ a self-supervised training strategy that combines instance contrastive loss and clustering loss to enable efficient and effective model training. coupling these three designs allows for training an end-to-end online clustering network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal rs data clustering, e.g., the highest clustering accuracy (92.28%) among existing methods on the hyperspectral-lidar trento dataset. our method demonstrates promising scalability in terms of modality and sample size, and it can also generalize to out-of-sample data. the code for this method is openly available at https://github .com /angrycai /tmpcc.",AB_0308
"adversarial training methods are frequently-used empirical defense methods against adversarial examples. while many regularization techniques demonstrate effectiveness when combined with adversarial training, these methods typically work in the time domain. however, as the adversarial vulnerability can be considered a high-frequency phenomenon, it is crucial to regulate adversarially-trained neural network models in the frequency domain to capture low-frequency and high-frequency features. neural networks must fully utilize the detailed local features extracted by their receptive field. to address these challenges, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the regularization properties of wavelets, which can enhance adversarial training. we propose a wavelet regularization method based on the haar wavelet decomposition named wavelet average pooling. this wavelet regularization module is integrated into a wide residual neural network to form a new model called widewaveletresnet. on the cifar-10 and cifar-100 datasets, our proposed adversarial wavelet training method demonstrates considerable robustness against different types of attacks. it confirms our assumption that our wavelet regularization method can enhance adversarial robustness, particularly in deep and wide neural networks. we present a detailed comparison of different wavelet base functions and conduct visualization experiments of the frequency principle (f-principle) and interpretability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. the code is available on the open-source website: https://github .com /momo1986 / adversarialwavelettraining.",AB_0308
"intrinsic dna properties including bending play a crucial role in diverse biological systems. a recent advance in a high-throughput technology called loop-seq makes it possible to determine the bendability of hundred thousand 50-bp dna duplexes in one experiment. however, it's still challenging to assess base-resolution sequence bendability in large genomes such as human, which requires thousands of such experiments. here, we introduce 'bendnet'-a deep neural network to predict the intrinsic dna bending at base-resolution by using loop-seq results in yeast as training data. bendnet can predict the dna bendability of any given sequence from different species with high accuracy. to explore the utility of bendnet, we applied it to the human genome and observed dna bendability is associated with chromatin features and disease risk regions involving transcription/enhancer regulation, dna replication, transcription factor binding and extrachromosomal circular dna generation. these findings expand our understanding on dna mechanics and its association with transcription regulation in mammals. lastly, we built a comprehensive resource of genomic dna bendability profiles for 307 species by applying bendnet, and provided an online tool to assess the bendability of user-specified dna sequences (http://www.dnabendnet.com/). graphical abstract",AB_0308
"time series forecasting (tsf) is a challenging problem in various real-world scenarios, such as industry, energy, weather, traffic, economics, and earthquake warning. tsf demands the model to have a high prediction accuracy. despite the promising performance of deep learning-based methods in tsf tasks, mainstream forecasting models may sometimes produce results that deviate from the actual ground truth. our analysis suggests that this may be attributed to the models' limited ability to capture the frequency information that is abundantly present in real-world datasets. currently, the fourier transform (ft) is the most widely used method for extracting frequency information, but it has some issues that lead to poor model performance, such as high -frequency noise caused by the gibbs phenomenon and computational overhead of the inverse transformation in the ft-ift process. to address these issues, we propose a novel frequency enhanced channel attention mechanism (fecam) that models frequency interdependencies between channels based on discrete cosine transform (dct), which inherently mitigates the high-frequency noise caused by problematic periodicity during fourier transform. this approach improves the model's capability to extract frequency features and resolves computational overhead concerns that arise from inverse transformations. our contributions are threefold: (1) we propose a novel frequency enhanced channel attention mechanism that models frequency interdependencies between channels based on dct, which improves the model's capability to extract frequency features and resolves computational overhead concerns that arise from inverse transformations; (2) we theoretically prove that our method mitigates the gibbs phenomenon, which introduces high frequency noise during fourier transform. we demonstrate that the result of 1d gap linearly varies with the lowest frequency component of 1d dct; (3) we demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed method fecam by embedding it into other networks, resulting in significant performance improvements when compared to the original model, with only a minor increase in parameters. furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on six different real-world tsf datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed model and compare it with several existing state-of-the-art models. our findings indicate that the fecam model is superior to these models in terms of accuracy, making it a promising solution for tsf in diverse real-world scenarios. our codes and data are available at https://github.com/zero-coder/fecam.",AB_0308
"the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks is a growing concern, as the emergence of adversarial samples exposes almost all models to the risk of such attacks. this paper proposes a new method for adversarial attacks through watermarking. our goal is to leverage the properties of adversarial samples to prevent people's images from being maliciously collected and compared, thereby avoiding the leakage of private information. our method, which improves on the multi-swarm particle swarm optimization (mpso) algorithm, outperforms existing similar methods on two popular computer vision datasets. we conducted attack experiments on the widely used imagenet dataset and achieve the highest attack success rate of 89.50%. the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing similar methods. we simulate the attacks on the online social environment using two face photographs datasets and face recognition models. our method reaches the best deception performance compared to similar methods, with the highest success rate of 97.03%, demonstrating our approach's ability to protect individuals' privacy. furthermore, we investigate the natural causes of adversarial samples and demonstrate their inevitability, providing valuable insights for developing more robust deep models. the source code of the proposed method is available online at: https://github.com/grandwang/main_attack.

"existing multi-view clustering algorithms are typically built on the prior assumption that data collected from different sources are complete without missing, while this is not always satisfied in real-world applications. incomplete multi-view clustering (imc) aims at discovering the latent cluster structure and partitioning the incomplete multi-view data into different groups, which is more practical yet challenging. moreover, the main bottleneck of the current imc research is how we could economically cluster large-scale incomplete multi-view data with limited resources. in this paper, we propose a novel scalable incomplete multi-view clustering with adaptive data completion (simc_adc) method, which seeks to deal with large-scale imc with promising instance-level restoration. specifically, to cater to large-scale imc, our simc_adc unifies representative anchor learning and similarity recovery into a one-stop learning scheme within linear computational and memory costs. moreover, we formulate an adaptive instance completion scheme to discover and generate trustworthy underlying connections across instances, which iteratively infers and pads the missing instances along with the complete similarity learning. importantly, theoretical analysis on data completion error further guarantees the reliability of such data completion paradigm. extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method when handling large-scale imc problems in comparison with state -of-the-art algorithms. the source code for our simc_adc is available at https://github .com / darrenzzhang /simc _adc.",AB_0308
"valsartan/amlodipine (i) is a single-pill combination (spc) of an angiotensin ii receptor blocker (arb) and a calcium channel blocker (ccb) for treating hypertension. a clinical trial was performed to demonstrate that the test and reference valsartan/amlodipine formulations were bioequivalent under fasting and postprandial conditions. participants were randomly divided into three sequences at a ratio of 1:1:1 for three-cycle, reference formulation replicated, crossover administration. the average bioequivalence (abe) and reference-scaled average bioequivalence (rsabe) methods were used to evaluate be using the main pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters. overall, 45 eligible participants were enrolled in the postprandial trial, which was consistent with the fasting trial. for valsartan, the rsabe method was used to evaluate the be of cmax, while the abe method was applied to evaluate the be of auc0-t and auc0-& infin;. both point estimates and 95% upper confidence bound met the be criteria. for amlodipine, the abe method was performed, and the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios (gmr) for cmax and auc0-72 h were all within 80%-125%, with the be criteria being met. therefore, the two formulations are bioequivalent and have similar safety profiles in healthy chinese subjects.clinical trial registration: [http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/index.html], identifier [ctr20210214].",AB_0308
