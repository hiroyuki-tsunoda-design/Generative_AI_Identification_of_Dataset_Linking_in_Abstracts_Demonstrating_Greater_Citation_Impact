"fine-grained visual classification (fgvc) is valuable yet challenging. the difficulty of fgvc mainly lies in its intrinsic inter-class similarity, intra-class variation, and limited training data. moreover, with the popularity of deep convolutional neural networks, researchers have mainly used deep, abstract, semantic information for fgvc, while shallow, detailed information has been neglected. this work proposes a cross-layer mutual attention learning network (cmal-net) to solve the above problems. specifically, this work views the shallow to deep layers of cnns as experts knowledgeable about different perspectives. we let each expert give a category prediction and an attention region indicating the found clues. attention regions are treated as information carriers among experts, bringing three benefits: ( i ) helping the model focus on discriminative regions; ( ii ) providing more training data; ( iii ) allowing experts to learn from each other to improve the overall performance. cmal-net achieves state-of-the-art performance on three competitive datasets: fgvc-aircraft, stanford cars, and food-11. the source code is available at https://github.com/dichao-liu/cmal",AB_0110
"quorum sensing peptides (qsps) are microbial signaling molecules involved in several cellular processes, such as cellular communication, virulence expression, bioluminescence, and swarming, in various bacterial species. understanding qsps is essential for identifying novel drug targets for controlling bacterial populations and pathogenicity. in this study, we present a novel computational approach (psrqsp) for improving the prediction and analysis of qsps. in psrqsp, we develop a novel propensity score representation learning (psr) scheme. specifically, we utilized the psr approach to extract and learn a comprehensive set of estimated propensities of 20 amino acids, 400 dipeptides, and 400 g-gap dipeptides from a pool of scoring card method-based models. finally, to maximize the utility of the propensity scores, we explored a set of optimal propensity scores and combined them to construct a final meta-predictor. our experimental results showed that combining multiview propensity scores was more beneficial for identifying qsps than the conventional feature descriptors. moreover, extensive benchmarking experiments based on the independent test were sufficient to demonstrate the predictive capability and effectiveness of psrqsp by outperforming the conventional ml-based and existing methods, with an accuracy of 94.44% and auc of 0.967. psr-derived propensity scores were employed to determine the crucial physicochemical properties for a better understanding of the functional mechanisms of qsps. finally, we constructed an easy-to-use web server for the psrqsp (http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/psrqsp). psrqsp is anticipated to be an efficient computational tool for accelerating the data-driven discovery of potential qsps for drug discovery and development.",AB_0110
"introductionhypophosphatasia (hpp) manifests in adults as fractures/pseudofractures, pain, muscle weakness, and other functional impairments. better phenotypic disease characterization is needed to help recognize disability and treat patients with hpp. methodsbaseline/pretreatment demographic, clinical characteristic, and patient-reported disability/health-related quality-of-life (hrqol) data from adults (>= 18 y) in the global hpp registry (nct02306720) were stratified by presence of overt skeletal manifestations (skeletal group) versus muscular/pain manifestations without skeletal manifestations (muscular/pain group) and summarized descriptively. disability was measured using the health assessment questionnaire-disability index (haq-di), and hrqol using the 36-item short form health survey (sf-36v2). resultsof 468 adults, 300 were classified into the skeletal group and 73 into the muscular/pain group. the skeletal group had a higher median age at baseline (50.1 vs 44.4 y; p=0.047) but a lower median age at first hpp manifestation (12.3 vs 22.1 y; p=0.0473), with more signs and symptoms (median, 4 vs 3; p<0.0001) and involved body systems (median, 3 vs 2; p<0.0001) than the muscular/pain group. more patients in the skeletal group required any use of mobility aids (22.6% vs 3.5%, respectively; p=0.001). six-minute walk test distances walked were similar between groups. sf-36v2 and haq-di scores were similar between groups for physical component summary (n=238; mean [sd]: 40.2 [11.0] vs 43.6 [11.2]; p=0.056), mental component summary (n=238; mean [sd]: 43.6 [11.3] vs 43.8 [11.8]; p=0.902), and haq-di (n=239; median [minimum, maximum]: 0.4 [0.0, 2.7] vs 0.3 [0.0, 2.1]; p=0.22). conclusionadults with hpp experience similar qol impairment regardless of skeletal involvement. registrationhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct02306720 and https://www.encepp.eu/encepp/viewresource.htm?id=47907, identifier nct02306720; eupas13514.",AB_0110
"domain generalization (dg) has attracted much attention in person re-identification (reid) recently. it aims to make a model trained on multiple source domains generalize to an unseen target domain. al-though achieving promising progress, existing methods usually need the source domains to be labeled, which could be a significant burden for practical reid tasks. in this paper, we turn to investigate unsu-pervised domain generalization for reid, by assuming that no label is available for any source domains. to address this challenging setting, we propose a simple and efficient domain-specific adaptive frame-work, and realize it with an adaptive normalization module designed upon the batch and instance nor-malization techniques. in doing so, we successfully yield reliable pseudo-labels to implement training and also enhance the domain generalization capability of the model as required. in addition, we show that our framework can even be applied to improve person reid under the settings of supervised domain gen-eralization and unsupervised domain adaptation, demonstrating competitive performance with respect to relevant methods. extensive experimental study on benchmark datasets is conducted to validate the pro-posed framework. a significance of our work lies in that it shows the potential of unsupervised domain generalization for person reid and sets a strong baseline for the further research on this topic. the code is available at https://github.com/qi5lei/dsaf .(c) 2023 published by elsevier ltd.",AB_0110
"adoption of artificial intelligence (ai) by the medical community has long been anticipated, endorsed by a stream of machine learning literature showcasing ai systems that yield extraordinary performance. however, many of these systems are likely over-promising and will under-deliver in practice. one key reason is the community's failure to acknowledge and address the presence of inflationary effects in the data. these simultaneously inflate evaluation performance and prevent a model from learning the underlying task, thus severely misrepresenting how that model would perform in the real world. this paper investigated the impact of these inflationary effects on healthcare tasks, as well as how these effects can be addressed. specifically, we defined three inflationary effects that occur in medical data sets and allow models to easily reach small training losses and prevent skillful learning. we investigated two data sets of sustained vowel phonation from participants with and without parkinson's disease, and revealed that published models which have achieved high classification performances on these were artificially enhanced due to the inflationary effects. our experiments showed that removing each inflationary effect corresponded with a decrease in classification accuracy, and that removing all inflationary effects reduced the evaluated performance by up to 30%. additionally, the performance on a more realistic test set increased, suggesting that the removal of these inflationary effects enabled the model to better learn the underlying task and generalize. source code is available at https://github.com/wenbo-g/pd-phonation-analysis under the mit license.",AB_0110
"protein-dna interactions play an important role in various biological processes such as gene expression, replication, and transcription. understanding the important features that dictate the binding affinity of protein dna complexes and predicting their affinities is important for elucidating their recognition mechanisms. in this work, we have collected the experimental binding free energy (delta g) for a set of 391 protein-dna complexes and derived several structure-based features such as interaction energy, contact potentials, volume and surface area of binding site residues, base step parameters of the dna and contacts between different types of atoms. our analysis on relationship between binding affinity and structural features revealed that the important factors mainly depend on the number of dna strands as well as functional and structural classes of proteins. specifically, binding site properties such as number of atom contacts between the dna and protein, volume of protein binding sites and interaction-based features such as interaction energies and contact potentials are important to un-derstand the binding affinity. further, we developed multiple regression equations for predicting the binding affinity of protein-dna complexes belonging to different structural and functional classes. our method showed an average correlation and mean absolute error of 0.78 and 0.98 kcal/mol, respectively, between the experi-mental and predicted binding affinities on a jack-knife test. we have developed a webserver, pda-pred (protein dna binding affinity predictor), for predicting the affinity of protein-dna complexes and it is freely available at https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/pdapred/",AB_0110
"we present an annotated dataset for the purposes of creating a benchmark in artificial intelligence for automated clot detection. while there are commercial tools available for automated clot detection on computed tomographic (ct) angiographs, they have not been compared in a standardized manner whereby accuracy is reported on a publicly available benchmark dataset. furthermore, there are known difficulties in automated clot detection - namely, cases where there is robust collateral flow, or residual flow and occlusions of the smaller vessels - and it is necessary to drive an initiative to overcome these challenges. our dataset contains 159 multiphase cta patient datasets, derived from ctp and annotated by expert stroke neurologists. in addition to images where the clot is marked, the expert neurologists have provided information about clot location, hemisphere and the degree of collateral flow. the data is available on request by researchers via an online form, and we will host a leaderboard where the results of clot detection algorithms on the dataset will be displayed. participants are invited to submit an algorithm to us for evaluation using the evaluation tool, which is made available at together with the form at https://github.com/mbc-neuroimaging/clotdetecteval .",AB_0110
"background: clinical guidelines recommend regular serum lithium monitoring every 3 to 6 months. however, in the real world, only a minority of patients receive adequate monitoring. objective: this study aims to examine whether the use of the electronic health record (ehr)-nested reminder system for serum lithium monitoring can help achieve serum lithium concentrations within the therapeutic range for patients on lithium maintenance therapy. methods: we conducted an unblinded, single-center, ehr-nested, parallel-group, superiority randomized controlled trial comparing ehr-nested reminders with usual care in adult patients receiving lithium maintenance therapy for mood disorders. the primary outcome was the achievement of therapeutically appropriate serum lithium levels between 0.4 and 1.0 meq/l at 18 months after enrollment. the key secondary outcomes are included as follows: the number of serum lithium level monitoring except for the first and final monitoring; exacerbation of the mood disorder during the study period, defined by hospitalization, increase in lithium dose, addition of antipsychotic drugs or mood stabilizers, or addition or increase of antidepressants; adherence defined by the proportion of days covered by lithium carbonate prescription during the study period. results: a total of 111 patients were enrolled in this study. a total of 56 patients were assigned to the reminder group, and 55 patients were assigned to the usual care group. at the follow-up, 38 (69.1%) patients in the reminder group and 33 (60.0%) patients in the usual care group achieved the primary outcome (odds ratio 2.14, 95% ci 0.82-5.58, p=.12). the median number of serum lithium monitoring was 2 in the reminder group and 0 in the usual care group (rate ratio 3.62; 95% ci 2.47-5.29, p<.001). the exacerbation of mood disorders occurred in 17 (31.5%) patients in the reminder group and in 16 (34.8%) patients in the usual care group (odds ratio 0.97, 95% ci 0.42-2.28, p=.95). conclusions: we found insufficient evidence for an ehr-nested reminder to increase the achievement of therapeutic serum lithium concentrations. however, the number of monitoring increased with relatively simple and inexpensive intervention. the ehr-based reminders may be useful to improve quality of care for patients on lithium maintenance therapy, and they have potentials to be applied to other problems. trial registration: university hospital medical information network clinical trials registry umin000033633; https://tinyurl.com/5n7wtyav",AB_0110
"knowledge of the spatial distribution of the fluxes of greenhouse gases (ghgs) and their temporal variability as well as flux attribution to natural and anthropogenic processes is essential to monitoring the progress in mitigating anthropogenic emissions under the paris agreement and to inform its global stocktake. this study provides a consolidated synthesis of ch4 and n2o emissions using bottom-up (bu) and top-down (td) approaches for the european union and uk (eu27 + uk) and updates earlier syntheses (petrescu et al., 2020, 2021). the work integrates updated emission inventory data, process-based model results, data-driven sector model results and inverse modeling estimates, and it extends the previous period of 1990-2017 to 2019. bu and td products are compared with european national greenhouse gas inventories (nghgis) reported by parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) in 2021. uncertainties in nghgis, as reported to the unfccc by the eu and its member states, are also included in the synthesis. variations in estimates produced with other methods, such as atmospheric inversion models (td) or spatially disaggregated inventory datasets (bu), arise from diverse sources including within-model uncertainty related to parameterization as well as structural differences between models. by comparing nghgis with other approaches, the activities included are a key source of bias between estimates, e.g., anthropogenic and natural fluxes, which in atmospheric inversions are sensitive to the prior geospatial distribution of emissions. for ch4 emissions, over the updated 2015-2019 period, which covers a sufficiently robust number of overlapping estimates, and most importantly the nghgis, the anthropogenic bu approaches are directly comparable, accounting for mean emissions of 20.5 tgch(4) yr(-1) (edgarv6.0, last year 2018) and 18.4 tgch(4) yr(-1) (gains, last year 2015), close to the nghgi estimates of 17 :5 +/- 2 :1 tgch(4) yr(-1). td inversion estimates give higher emission estimates, as they also detect natural emissions. over the same period, high-resolution regional td inversions report a mean emission of 34 tgch(4) yr(-1). coarser-resolution global-scale td inversions result in emission estimates of 23 and 24 tgch(4) yr(-1) inferred from gosat and surface (surf) network atmospheric measurements, respectively. the magnitude of natural peatland and mineral soil emissions from the jsbach-himmeli model, natural rivers, lake and reservoir emissions, geological sources, and biomass burning together could account for the gap between nghgi and inversions and account for 8 tgch(4) yr(-1). for n2o emissions, over the 2015-2019 period, both bu products (edgarv6.0 and gains) report a mean value of anthropogenic emissions of 0.9 tgn(2)oyr(-1), close to the nghgi data (0 :8 +/- 55% tgn(2)oyr(-1)). over the same period, the mean of td global and regional inversions was 1.4 tgn(2)oyr(-1) (excluding tomcat, which reported no data). the td and bu comparison method defined in this study can be operationalized for future annual updates for the calculation of ch4 and n2o budgets at the national and eu27 c uk scales. future comparability will be enhanced with further steps involving analysis at finer temporal resolutions and estimation of emissions over intra-annual timescales, which is of great importance for ch4 and n2o, and may help identify sector contributions to divergence between prior and posterior estimates at the annual and/or inter-annual scale. even if currently comparison between ch4 and n2o inversion estimates and nghgis is highly uncertain because of the large spread in the inversion results, td inversions inferred from atmospheric observations represent the most independent data against which inventory totals can be compared. with anticipated improvements in atmospheric modeling and observations, as well as modeling of natural fluxes, td inversions may arguably emerge as the most powerful tool for verifying emission inventories for ch4, n2o and other ghgs. the referenced dataset srelated to figures are visualized at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7553800 (petrescu et al., 2023).",AB_0110
"background: recently, diastolic stress testing and invasive hemodynamic measurements have been emphasized for diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (hfpef) because when determined using noninvasive parameters it can fall into a nondiagnostic intermediate range. the current study evaluated the discriminative and prognostic roles of invasive measured left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the population with suspected hfpef, particularly for patients with intermediate heart failure association pre-test assessment, echocardiography & natriuretic peptide, functional testing, final etiology (hfa-peff) score. methods and results: a total of 404 patients with symptoms or signs of hf and preserved left ventricular systolic function were enrolled. all subjects underwent left heart catheterization with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure measurement for confirmation of hfpef (>= 16 mm hg). the primary outcome was all-cause death or readmission due to hf within 10 years. among the study population, 324 patients (80.2%) were diagnosed as invasively confirmed hfpef, and 80 patients (19.8%) were as noncardiac dyspnea. the patients with hfpef showed a significantly higher hfa-peff score than the patients with noncardiac dyspnea (3.8 +/- 1.8 versus 2.6 +/- 1.5, p<0.001). the discriminative ability of the hfa-peff score for diagnosing hfpef was modest (area under the curve, 0.70 [95% ci, 0.64-0.75], p<0.001). the hfa-peff score was associated with a significantly higher 10-year risk of death or hf readmission (per-1 increase, hazard ratio [hr], 1.603 [95% ci, 1.376-1.868], p<0.001). among the 226 patients with an intermediate hfa-peff score (2-4), those with invasively confirmed hfpef had a significantly higher risk of death or hf readmission within 10 years than the patients with noncardiac dyspnea (24.0% versus 6.9%, hr, 3.327 [95% ci, 1.109-16.280], p=0.030). conclusions: the hfa-peff score is a moderately useful tool for predicting future adverse events in suspected hfpef, and invasively measured left ventricular end-diastolic pressure can provide additional information to discriminate patient prognosis, particularly in those with intermediate hfa-peff scores. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct04505449.",AB_0110
