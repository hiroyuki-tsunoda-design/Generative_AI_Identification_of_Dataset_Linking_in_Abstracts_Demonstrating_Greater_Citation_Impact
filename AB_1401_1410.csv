"visual intention understanding is to mine the potential and subjective intention behind the images, which includes the user's hidden emotions and perspectives. due to the label ambiguity, this paper presents a novel learnable hierarchical label embedding and grouping (hleg). it is featured in three aspects: 1) for effectively mining the underlying meaning of images, we build a hierarchical transformer structure to model the hierarchy of labels, formulating a multi-level classification scheme. 2) for the label ambiguity issue, we design a novel learnable label embedding with accumulative grouping integrated into the hierarchical structure, which does not require additional annotation. 3) for multi-level classification, we propose a hard-first optimization strategy to adaptively adjust the classification optimization at different levels, avoiding over-classification of the coarse labels. hleg enhances the f1 score (average +1.24%) and map (average +1.48%) on intentonomy over prominent baseline models. comprehensive experiments validate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance under various settings. code is available at https://github.com/shiqinghongya/hleg.",AB_0141
"background: anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (ckd). hemoglobin variability is a well-documented parameter representing hemoglobin control. however, there is still lack of evidence about whether risk factors related to hemoglobin (hb) level simultaneously affect hb variability. this study aimed to evaluate the association of serum phosphorus with hemoglobin level and its longitudinal variation in patients with chronic kidney disease. methods: data were obtained from the chinese cohort study of chronic kidney disease (c-stride), which was a nation-wide multicenter prospective cohort study. the association of phosphorus with hemoglobin level was evaluated in 3227 patients. longitudinal variation of hemoglobin level was evaluated in 753 patients. linear regression models and logistic regression mod-els were used to assess the association of phosphorus with hemoglobin level, anemia prevalence, and longitudinal variation of hemoglobin over 2 years. results: serum phosphorus was negatively associated with hemoglobin level. while 1 mmol/l increase in serum phosphorus was associated with 11.72 g/dl decrease in hemoglobin (95% confidence interval 14.42 to 9.02 g/dl). each 0.1 mmol/l increase in phosphorous was associated with 14% increase in prevalence of anemia (odds ratio (or): 1.14, 95% ci: 1.12 to 1.16). in the longitudinal analysis, serum phosphorus was independently associated with the residual standard deviation and absolute range of hemoglobin. conclusion: serum phosphorus level was independently associated with baseline hemoglobin level, the prevalence of anemia and longitudinal variation of hemoglobin in chinese patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd). clinical trial registration: nct03041987, available at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/.",AB_0141
"background: widespread insecticide exposure might be a risk factor for neurodevelopment of our children, but few studies examined the mixture effect of maternal coexposure to organophosphate insecticides (opps), pyrethroids (pyrs), and neonicotinoid insecticides (nnis) during pregnancy on child neurodevelopment, and critical windows of exposure are unknown. objectives: we aimed to evaluate the association of prenatal exposure to multiple insecticides with children's neurodevelopment and to identify critical windows of the exposure. methods: pregnant women were recruited into a prospective birth cohort study in wuhan, china, from 2014-2017. eight metabolites of opps (mopps), three metabolites of pyrs (mpyrs), and nine metabolites of nnis (mnnis) were measured in 3,123 urine samples collected at their first, second, and third trimesters. children's neurodevelopment [mental development index (mdi) and psychomotor development index (pdi)] was assessed using the bayley scales of infant development at 2 years of age (n = 1,041). multivariate linear regression models, generalized estimating equation models, and weighted quantile sum (wqs) regression were used to estimate the association between the insecticide metabolites and bayley scores. potential sex-specific associations were also examined. results: single chemical analysis suggested higher urinary concentrations of some insecticide metabolites at the first trimester were significantly associated with lower mdi and pdi scores, and the associations were more prominent among boys. each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed urinary concentrations of two mopps, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and 4-nitrophenol, was associated with a decrease of 3.16 points [95% confidence interval (ci): -5.59, -0.74] and 3.06 points (95% ci: -5.45, -0.68) respectively in boys' mdi scores. each 1-unit increase in that of trans-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (trans-dcca; an mpyr) was significantly associated with a decrease of 2.24 points (95% ci: -3.89, -0.58) in boys' mdi scores and 1.90 points (95% ci: -3.16, -0.64) in boys' pdi scores, respectively. significantly positive associations of maternal urinary biomarker concentrations [e.g., dimethyl phosphate (a nonspecific mopp) and desmethyl-clothianidin (a relatively specific mnni)] with child neurodevelopment were also observed. using repeated holdout validation, a 1-quartile increase in the wqs index of the insecticide mixture (in the negative direction) at the first trimester was significantly associated with a decrease of 3.02 points (95% ci: -5.47, -0.57) in mdi scores among the boys, and trans-dcca contributed the most to the association (18%). conclusions: prenatal exposure to higher levels of certain insecticides and their mixture were associated with lower bayley scores in children, particularly in boys. early pregnancy may be a sensitive window for such an effect. future studies are needed to confirm our findings. https://doi.org/",AB_0141
"visual localization plays an important role for intelligent robots and autonomous driving, especially when the accuracy of gnss is unreliable. recently, camera localization in lidar maps has attracted more and more attention for its low cost and potential robustness to illumination and weather changes. however, the commonly used pinhole camera has a narrow field-of-view, leading to limited information compared with the omnidirectional lidar data. to overcome this limitation, we focus on correlating the information of 360 degrees spherical images to point clouds, proposing an end-to-end learnable network to conduct cross-modal visual localization by establishing similarity in high-dimensional feature space. inspired by the attention mechanism, we optimize the network to capture the salient feature for comparing images and point clouds. we construct several 2-d-3-d sequences containing 360 degrees spherical images and the corresponding point clouds based on the kitti-360 dataset and conduct extensive experiments. the evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. the source code and dataset are released at https://github.com/zhaozhpe/ae-crossmodal.",AB_0141
"objective despite the controversy surrounding brain invasion (bi) as the sole indicator used to diagnose atypical meningioma, this criterion was still incorporated in the 2021 who classification scheme. in this study, the authors investigated the reproducibility of this prognostic effect and the impact of bi on the prognosis in otherwise benign meningioma (benign meningioma with bi).methods patients (n = 1006) with a pathological diagnosis of benign or atypical meningioma according to the latest who classification criteria were enrolled in this study. in patients with atypical meningioma, the cases were further categorized as benign meningioma with bi and classical atypical meningioma. clinical, pathological, and follow-up data were collected. kaplan-meier curves were compared with a log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.results the study patient cohort included 282 (28.0%) individuals who were pathologically confirmed as having bi among all 1006 patients with benign or atypical meningioma. a significant difference in recurrence-free survival was observed between patients who had benign meningioma with bi and those who had classical atypical meningioma (p < 0.001), as well as between patients with benign meningiomas and those without bi (p = 0.003). multivariate cox analysis indicated that bi was independently associated with increased risk of relapse in the entire population (hr 1.46, 95% ci 1.01-2.12, p = 0.049) and in the atypical meningioma subcohort (hr 2.21, 95% ci 1.32-3.71, p = 0.003), as well as the benign meningioma with and without bi subcohorts (hr 1.89, 95% ci 1.01-3.56, p = 0.049). moreover, patients with classical atypical meningiomas had a risk of relapse four times higher than those who had benign meningioma with bi (p < 0.001).conclusions the findings demonstrate that benign meningioma with bi typically has an intermediate prognosis and can be differentiated from benign meningioma and classical atypical meningioma, which suggests that the importance of the diagnostic effect of bi is insufficiently accounted for in grading of atypical meningioma. increased emphasis on the presence of bi in patients with atypical meningioma may be helpful in postsurgical decision-making and facilitating improvements in individual therapy. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.2.jns222751",AB_0141
"background:hypertension and enlarged perivascular spaces (epvs) are thought to be associated with cognitive impairment. however, the correlations among hypertension, epvs, and cognitive impairment have not been studied yet. we aimed to investigate the relationships between cumulative blood pressure (cbp) exposure with epvs and cognitive impairment and whether epvs may mediate the relationship between cbp and cognitive impairment.methods:a total of 1507 subjects from the kailuan prospective cohort study were enrolled. cbp was calculated from 2006 to 2022. the effects of cbp, epvs scores, and cognitive impairment were evaluated using a logistic regression model. the relationships among cbp, epvs score, and cognitive impairment were analyzed using a mediation model.results:an increase in cbp was positively correlated with an increase in epvs score. for every sd increase in cbp, the odds ratios (95% ci) of increased epvs score of the centrum semiovale were 1.67 (1.43-1.95), 1.63 (1.4-1.9), and 1.35 (1.17-1.56), respectively; the odds ratios (95% ci) of increased epvs score of the basal ganglia were 1.83 (1.56-2.15), 2.01 (1.7-2.36), and 1.31 (1.13-1.52), respectively; and the odds ratios (95% ci) of developing cognitive impairment were 1.28 (1.06-1.53), 1.13 (0.95-1.34), and 1.28 (1.07-1.5), respectively. basal ganglia-epvs score accounted for 10.46% to 18.32% of the mediating effects on the relationships of cbp/sd with cognitive impairment.conclusions:high cbp exposure was an independent risk factor for epvs, and basal ganglia-epvs score mediated the effects of cbp on cognitive impairment.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: chictr-tnrc-11001489.",AB_0141
"autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a pervasive developmental disorder, and the earlier detection and timely intervention for treatment positively affect the prognosis of patients. deep learning algorithms based on graph structure have achieved good results in autism prediction in recent years. however, there are problems with standardized operations in extracting features and combining neighborhood node features with the structure of the graph dependent, which limits the generalization ability of the trained model to other graph structures. in this paper, we propose a graph fusion autism prediction model based on attentional mechanisms(agf) to address the above problems. the agf model represents the overall population (patients or healthy controls) as a sparse graph, where nodes are subjects, and non-imaging features are integrated as edge weights. different weights can be defined for different nodes in the neighborhood through the attention mechanism without relying on prior knowledge of the graph structure. the model is also able to dynamically fuse multiple sparse graphs obtained from different non-imaging features by way of training weight assignment. its performance is also compared with several other models (e.g., s-agf, gcn, etc.), and the results show that it has superior prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model. the results show that this improvement of graph fusion works better on the abide databases, and the classification accuracy can reach 73.9%. the datasets and source code are freely available at https://github.com/chengyu-github1012/graph-fusion.git. strengths and limitations of this study: graph fusion; disease prediction; noise.",AB_0141
"background:stroke survivors constantly feel helpless and unprepared after discharge from hospitals. more flexible and pragmatic support are needed for their optimized recovery. we examined the effects of a virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic on survivors' health and self-management outcomes.methods:a randomized controlled trial was conducted. survivors were recruited from 10 hospitals and randomized at 1:1 ratio into the intervention or the control groups. intervention group participants received the virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic service (monthly online consultations with a nurse, follow-up phone calls, and access to an online platform). control group participants received the usual care. outcomes of self-efficacy (stroke self-efficacy questionnaire; primary), self-management behaviors (stroke self-management behaviors performance scale), social participation (reintegration to normal living index), and depression (geriatric depression scale; secondary) were measured at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after commencing the intervention (post-randomization). a generalized estimating equations model was used to compare the differential changes in outcomes at 3 and 6 months with respect to baseline between 2 groups.results:between july 2019 and june 2022, 335 eligible participants were enrolled in the study. participants (intervention group; n=166) showed significantly greater improvements in outcomes of self-efficacy (group-by-time interaction regression coefficient, b=4.60 [95% ci, 0.16 to 9.05]), social participation (b=5.07 [95% ci, 0.61 to 9.53]), and depression (b=-2.33 [95% ci, -4.06 to -0.61]), and no significant improvement in performance of self-management behaviors (b=3.45, [95% ci, -0.87 to 7.77]), compared with the control group (n=169) right after the intervention (6 months after its commencement). hedges' g effect sizes of the intervention on outcomes: 0.19 to 0.36.conclusions:the results provide some positive evidence on the usefulness of the virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic service. the effect sizes are regarded as small to medium, which may not be of clinical relevance. the baseline levels in outcomes were in favor of the control group, the intervention effects might be overestimated. the service must be tested further to determine its effectiveness.registration:url: https://www.chictr.org.cn; unique identifier: chictr1800016101.",AB_0141
"text, visual, and acoustic are usually complementary in the multimodal sentiment analysis (msa) task. however, current methods primarily concern shared representations while neglecting the critical private aspects of data within individual modalities. in this work, we propose shared-private memory networks based on the recent advances in the attention mechanism, called spmn, to decouple multimodal representation from shared and private perspectives. it contains three components: a) a shared memory to learn the shared representations of multimodal data; b) three private memories to learn the private representations of individual modalities, respectively; c) and adaptive fusion gates to fuse multimodal private and shared representations. to evaluate the effectiveness of spmn, we integrate it into different pre-trained language representation models, such as bert and xlnet, and conduct experiments on two public datasets, cmu-mosi and cmu-mosei. experimental results indicate that the performances of pre-trained language representation models are significantly improved because of spmn and demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to the state-of-the-art methods. spmn's source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaobaicaihhh/spmn.",AB_0141
"objective the anatomy of the temporal branches of the facial nerve (fn) has been widely described in the neurosurgical literature because of its relevance in anterolateral approaches to the skull base and implication in frontalis palsies from these approaches. in this study, the authors attempted to describe the anatomy of the temporal branches of the fn and identify whether there are any fn branches that cross the interfascial space of the superficial and deep leaflets of the temporalis fascia.methods the surgical anatomy of the temporal branches of the fn was studied bilaterally in 5 embalmed heads (n = 10 extracranial fns). exquisite dissections were performed to preserve the relationships of the branches of the fn and their relationship to the surrounding fascia of the temporalis muscle, the interfascial fat pad, the surrounding nerve branches, and their final terminal endpoints near the frontalis and temporalis muscles. the authors correlated their findings intraoperatively with 6 consecutive patients with interfascial dissection in which neuromonitoring was performed to stimulate the fn and associated twigs that were observed to be interfascial in 2 of them.results the temporal branches of the fn stay predominantly superficial to the superficial leaflet of the temporal fascia in the loose areolar tissue near the superficial fat pad. as they course over the frontotemporal region, they give off a twig that anastomoses with the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve, which crosses the superficial layer of the temporalis muscle, spanning the interfascial fat pad, and then pierces the deep temporalis fascial layer. this anatomy was observed in 10 of the 10 fns dissected. intraoperatively, stimulation of this interfascial segment yielded no facial muscle response up to 1 ma in any of the patients. conclusions the temporal branch of the fn gives off a twig that anastomoses with the zygomaticotemporal nerve, which crosses the superficial and deep leaflets of the temporal fascia. interfascial surgical techniques aimed at protecting the frontalis branch of the fn are safe in their efforts to protect against frontalis palsy with no clinical sequelae when executed properly. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.1.jns222027",AB_0141
