"recent research has revealed that pre-trained models (ptms) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks before the fine-tuning stage. the attackers can implant transferable task-agnostic backdoors in ptms, and control model outputs on any downstream task, which poses severe security threats to all downstream applications. existing backdoor-removal defenses focus on task-specific classification models and they are not suitable for defending ptms against task-agnostic backdoor attacks. to this end, we propose the first task-agnostic backdoor removal method for ptms. based on the selective activation phenomenon in backdoored ptms, we design a simple and effective backdoor eraser, which continually pre-trains the backdoored ptms with a regularization term in an end-to-end approach. the regularization term removes backdoor functionalities from ptms while the continual pre-training maintains the normal functionalities of ptms. we conduct extensive experiments on pre-trained models across different modalities and architectures. the experimental results show that our method can effectively remove backdoors inside ptms and preserve benign functionalities of ptms with a few downstream-task-irrelevant auxiliary data, e.g., unlabeled plain texts. the average attack success rate on three downstream datasets is reduced from 99.88% to 8.10% after our defense on the backdoored bert. the codes are publicly available at https://github.com/thunlp/recipe.",AB_0128
"background: traditional approaches to drug development are costly and involve high risks. the drug repurposing approach can be a valuable alternative to traditional approaches and has therefore received considerable attention in recent years. findings: herein, we develop a previously undescribed computational approach, called drugsim2dr, which uses a network diffusion algorithm to identify candidate anticancer drugs based on a drug functional similarity network. the innovation of the approach lies in the drug-drug functional similarity network constructed in a manner that implicitly links drugs through their common biological functions in the context of a specific disease state, as the similarity relationships based on general states (e.g., network proximity or jaccard index of drug targets) ignore disease-specific molecular characteristics. the drug functional similarity network may provide a reference for prediction of drug combinations. we describe and validate the drugsim2dr approach through analysis of data on breast cancer and lung cancer. drugsim2dr identified some us food and drug administration-approved anticancer drugs, as well as some candidate drugs validated by previous studies in the literature. moreover, drugsim2dr showed excellent predictive performance, as evidenced by receiver operating characteristic analysis and multiapproach comparisons in various cancer datasets. conclusions: drugsim2dr could accurately assess drug-drug functional similarity within a specific disease context and may more effectively prioritize disease candidate drugs. to increase the usability of our approach, we have developed an r-based software package, drugsim2dr, which is freely available on cran (https://cran.r- project.org/package=drugsim2dr).",AB_0128
"background: the impact of atrial fibrillation (af) on the clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (ais) who received endovascular thrombectomy remains unclear. we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of adjusted effect estimates to examine the association between the presence of af and the clinical outcomes in patients with ais who received endovascular thrombectomy. methods and results: we searched pubmed, embase, and the cochrane database between january 1, 2013 and july 10, 2023. data were meta-analyzed to compare the outcomes among patients with ais with and without af who received endovascular thrombectomy. our primary outcome was 90-day functional independence defined as a modified rankin scale score of 0 to 2. secondary outcomes included excellent independence (90-day modified rankin scale score of 0-1), 90-day mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and any intracranial hemorrhage. eighteen observational studies comprising 16 096 patients with ais (mean age, 70.1 years; women, 48.2%; 6862 with af versus 9234 without af) were included. there were no statistically significant differences for modified rankin scale score of 0 to 2 (pooled odds ratio [or], 1.14 [95% ci, 0.95-1.37]; [95% prediction interval [pi], 0.72-1.80]), mortality (or, 0.92 [95% ci, 0.79-1.08]; [95% pi, 0.77-1.11]), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (or, 0.97 [95% ci, 0.71-1.32]; [95% pi, 0.43-2.17]), and any intracranial hemorrhage (or, 1.08 [95% ci, 0.91-1.28]; [95% pi, 0.74-1.58]) among patients with ais with and without af. conclusions: this meta-analysis detected no significant differences in 90-day functional outcomes, mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage risk after endovascular thrombectomy in patients with ais with and without af. registration: url: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero; unique identifier: crd 42021293511.",AB_0128
"backgroundparticipants with prediabetes are at a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes (t2d). recent studies have suggested that blocking the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa b ligand (rankl) may improve glucose metabolism and delay the development of t2d. however, the effect of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits rankl, on glycemic parameters in the prediabetes population is uncertain. we aim to examine the effect of denosumab on glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and prediabetes.methodsthis is a 12-month multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial involving postmenopausal women who have been diagnosed with both osteoporosis and prediabetes. osteoporosis is defined by the world health organization (who) as a bone mineral density t score of <= - 2.5, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa). prediabetes is defined as (i) a fasting plasma glucose level of 100-125 mg/dl, (ii) a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 140-199 mg/dl, or (iii) a glycosylated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) level of 5.7-6.4%. a total of 346 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg every 6 months or oral alendronate 70 mg every week for 12 months. the primary outcome is the change in hba1c levels from baseline to 12 months. secondary outcomes include changes in fasting and 2-hour blood glucose levels, serum insulin levels, c-peptide levels, and insulin sensitivity from baseline to 12 months, and the incidence of t2d at the end of the study. follow-up visits will be scheduled at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.discussionthis study aims to provide evidence on the efficacy of denosumab on glucose metabolism in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and prediabetes. the results derived from this clinical trial may provide insight into the potential of denosumab in preventing t2d in high-risk populations.trial registrationthis study had been registered in the chinese clinical trials registry. registration number: chictr2300070789 on april 23, 2023. https://www.chictr.org.cn.",AB_0128
"epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) is a common process during tumor progression and is always related to residual tumor, drug resistance and immune suppression. however, considering the heterogeneity in emt process, there is still a need to establish robust emt classification system with reasonable molecular, biological and clinical implications to investigate whether these unfavorable survival factors are common or unique in different individuals. in our work, we classify tumors with four emt status, that is, emtlow, emtmid, emthigh-nos (not otherwise specified), and emthigh-akt (akt pathway overactivation) subtypes. we find that emthigh-nos subtype is driven by intrinsic somatic alterations. while, emthigh-akt subtype is maintained by extrinsic cellular interplay between tumor cells and macrophages in an akt-dependent manner. emthigh-akt subtype is both unresectable and drug resistant while emthigh-nos subtype can be treated with cell cycle related drugs. importantly, akt activation in emthigh-akt not only enhances emt process, but also contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. by remodeling tumor immune-microenvironment by akt inhibition, emthigh-akt can be treated by immune checkpoint blockade therapies. meanwhile, we develop tumormt website (http://tumormt.neuroscience.org.cn/) to apply this emt classification and provide reasonable therapeutic guidance. a pan-cancer study indicates two mesenchymal-like tumor subtypes with distinct intrinsic or extrinsic driving mechanisms and could be used to guide chemotherapy and immune therapy.",AB_0128
"epigenetic modulators play an increasingly crucial role in the treatment of various diseases. in this case, it is imperative to systematically investigate the activity of these agents and understand their influence on the entire epigenetic regulatory network rather than solely concentrate on individual targets. this work introduces mt-epipred, a multitask learning method capable of predicting the activity of compounds against 78 epigenetic targets. mt-epipred demonstrated outstanding performance, boasting an average auroc of 0.915 and the ability to handle few-shot targets. in comparison to the existing method, mt-epipred not only expands the target pool but also achieves superior predictive performance with the same data set. mt-epipred was then applied to predict the epigenetic target of a newly synthesized compound (1), where the molecular target was unknown. the method identified kdm4d as a potential target, which was subsequently validated through an in vitro enzyme inhibition assay, revealing an ic50 of 4.8 mu m. the mt-epipred method has been implemented in the web server mt-epipred (http://epipred.com), providing free accessibility. in summary, this work presents a convenient and accurate tool for discovering novel small-molecule epigenetic modulators, particularly in the development of selective inhibitors and evaluating the impact of these inhibitors over a broad epigenetic network.",AB_0128
"as an important multisensor data fusion technology, multifocus image fusion (mfif) integrates all focused information from source images to provide a comprehensive and objective interpretation. however, current mfif algorithms have limitations on blurred edges and oversharpening of the fused images, resulting in loss of details or introduction of artifacts. in this article, we propose a novel mfif scheme based on multiscale cross-difference and focus detection. first, to extract the pixel information at different scales, we express the source images at different scales using multiscale-guided filtering. subsequently, we proposed a multiscale cross-difference strategy for obtaining the salient map, which accurately highlights the pixels within the focused regions. meanwhile, we designed an effective two-scale decision map generation model to accurately refine the focus decision maps. finally, we introduce guided filter (gf) and consistency verification operations to optimize and obtain the final decision maps and the fused result. the proposed model can effectively address edge blur and detail loss and improve the clarity and visual quality of fused images. experiments were performed on two popular public datasets and the subjective and objective evaluations indicate that the proposed method has a better performance than 28 state-of-the-art (sota) methods. the code of this work was available at https://github.com/ixilai/mcfdf.",AB_0128
"multiple studies have demonstrated that microrna (mirna) can be deeply involved in the regulatory mechanism of human microbiota, thereby inducing disease. developing effective methods to infer potential associations between micrornas (mirnas) and diseases can aid early diagnosis and treatment. recent methods utilize machine learning or deep learning to predict mirna-disease associations (mdas), achieving state-of-the-art performance. however, the problem of sparse neighborhoods of nodes due to lack of data has not been well solved. to this end, we propose a new model named mtcl-mda, which integrates multiple-types of contrastive learning strategies into a graph collaborative filtering model to predict potential mdas. the model adopts a contrastive learning strategy based on topology, which alleviates the damage to model performance caused by sparse neighborhoods. in addition, the model also adopts a semantic-based contrastive learning strategy, which not only reduces the impact of noise introduced by topology-based contrastive learning, but also enhances the semantic information of nodes. experimental results show that our model outperforms existing models on all evaluation metrics. case analysis shows that our model can more accurately identify potential mda, which is of great significance for the screening and diagnosis of real-life diseases. our data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/lqingquan/mtcl-mda.",AB_0128
"background: cancer is widely regarded as a complex disease primarily driven by genetic mutations. a critical concern and significant obstacle lies in discerning driver genes amid an extensive array of passenger genes. findings: we present a new method termed drivermp for effectively prioritizing altered genes on a cancer-type level by considering mutated gene pairs. it is designed to first apply nonsilent somatic mutation data, proteinprotein interaction network data, and differential gene expression data to prioritize mutated gene pairs, and then individual mutated genes are prioritized based on prioritized mutated gene pairs. application of this method in 10 cancer datasets from the cancer genome atlas demonstrated its great improvements over all the compared state-of-the-art methods in identifying known driver genes. then, a comprehensive analysis demonstrated the reliability of the novel driver genes that are strongly supported by clinical experiments, disease enrichment, or biological pathway analysis. conclusions: the new method, drivermp, which is able to identify driver genes by effectively integrating the advantages of multiple kinds of cancer data, is available at https://github.com/liuyangyangsdu/drivermp. in addition, we have developed a novel driver gene database for 10 cancer types and an online service that can be freely accessed without registration for users. the drivermp method, the database of novel drivers, and the user-friendly online server are expected to contribute to new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for cancers.",AB_0128
"backgroundcontinuous loss of muscle mass and strength are the consequences of the ageing process, which increase the risk of falls among older people. falls can lead to severe consequences such as bone fractures and hampered physical and psychological well-being. regular exercise is the key to reversing muscle atrophy and relieving sarcopenia. however, the frailty of older people and the recent covid-19 pandemic may affect their confidence to leave home to attend classes in the community. a feasible and effective alternative should be explored.methodsthe primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of tele-exercise (te) in relation to physical functioning and exercise adherence among community-dwelling older people at risk of falls in comparison with a community-based group (cb). the secondary objective includes evaluating older people's experience with tele-exercise, emphasizing their psychological welfare, social well-being, and acceptance of the telehealth approach. the design, conduct, and report follow the spirit guidelines (standard protocol items: recommended items to address in a clinical trial protocol and related documents). older people will be recruited from 10 local community centres in hong kong and randomly allocated into two groups. all participants will attend the exercise training 3 days per week for 3 months but the mode of delivery will differ, either online as the tele-exercise group (te) or face-to-face as the community-based group (cb). the outcome measures include muscle strength, physical function, exercise adherence and dropout rate, psychological and social well-being will be assessed at the baseline, and the 3rd, 6th and 12th month. some participants will be invited to attend focus group interviews to evaluate their overall experience of the tele-exercise training.discussiontele-exercise reduces the barriers to exercise, such as time constraints, inaccessibility to facilities, and the fear of frail older people leaving their homes. promoting an online home-based exercise programme for older people can encourage them to engage in regular physical activity and increase their exercise adherence even when remaining at home. the use of telehealth can potentially result in savings in cost and time. the final findings will provide insights on delivering exercise via telehealth to older people and propose an exercise delivery and maintenance model for future practice.trial registrationchinese clinical trial registry (https://www.chictr.org.cn/hvshowprojecten.html?id=219002&v=1.1), registration number: chictr2200063370. registered on 5 september 2022.",AB_0128
