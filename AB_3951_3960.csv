"purpose: suicide is a global concern, especially among young people. suicide prediction models have the potential to make it easier to identify patients who are at a high risk of suicide, but they have very little predictive power when there is a positive value for suicide mortality. therefore, the aim of the study is to uncover potential risk factors associated with suicide by self-poisoning and further to provide a trustworthy nomogram to predict self-poisoning suicide among poisoned patients. methods: this study prospectively enrolled 237 patients who were treated for poisoning at the fifth medical center of pla general hospital (beijing) between may 2021 and may 2022. patient's basic characteristics, daily activities, mental health status, and history of psychological illnesses were gathered to examine their predictive power for self-poisoning suicide. on developing a prediction model, patients were split 8:2 into a training (n = 196) group and a validation (n = 41) group at random via computer. the training group worked on model development, while the validation group worked on model validation. in this study, the hosmer and lemeshow test, accuracy, and area under the curve were the primary evaluation criteria. shapley additive explanations (shap) was determined to evaluate feature importance. to make the prediction model easy for researchers to utilize, it was presented in nomogram format. two risk groups of patients were identified based on the ideal cut-off value. results: of all poisoned patients, 64.6% committed suicide by self-poisoning. with regard to self-poisoning attempted suicide, multivariate analysis demonstrated that female gender, smoking, generalized anxiety disorder-7 (gad-7), and beck hopelessness scale-20 (bhs-20) were significant risk factors, whereas married status, relatively higher education level, a sedentary time of 1-3 h per day, higher sport frequency per week, higher monthly income were significant protective features. the nomogram contained each of the aforementioned nine features. in the training group, the area under curve (auc) of the nomogram was up to 0.938 (0.904-0.972), whereas in the validation group, it reached a maximum of 0.974 (0.937-1.000). corresponding accuracy rates were up to 0.883 and 0.927, respectively, and the p-values for the hosmer and lemeshow test were 0.178 and 0.346, respectively. shap demonstrated that the top three most important features were bhs-20, gad-7, and marital status. based on the best cut-off value of the nomogram (40%), patients in the high-risk group had a nearly six-time larger likelihood of committing suicide by self-poisoning than patients in the low-risk group (88.68 vs. 15.38%, p < 0.001). the dynamic nomogram was made available at the following address: https://xiaobo.shinyapps. io/nomogramselfpoisoningsuicide/. conclusions: this study proposes a prediction model to stratify patients at a high risk of suicide by self-poisoning and to guide individual preventive strategies. patients in the high-risk group require further mental health counseling to alleviate anxiety and hopelessness, healthy lifestyle like quitting smoking and exercising more, and restriction of access to poison and psychiatric drugs.",AB_0396
"multi-omics data integration has emerged as a promising approach to identify patient subgroups. however, in terms of grouping genes (or gene products) into co-expression modules, data integration methods suffer from two main drawbacks. first, most existing methods only consider genes or samples measured in all different datasets. second, known molecular interactions (e.g., transcriptional regulatory interactions, protein-protein interactions and biological pathways) cannot be utilized to assist in module detection. herein, we present a novel data integration framework, correlation-based local approximation of membership (clam), which provides two methodological innovations to address these limitations: 1) constructing a trans-omics neighborhood matrix by integrating multi-omics datasets and known molecular interactions, and 2) using a local approximation procedure to define gene modules from the matrix. applying correlation-based local approximation of membership to human colorectal cancer (crc) and mouse b-cell differentiation multi-omics data obtained from the cancer genome atlas (tcga), clinical proteomics tumor analysis consortium (cptac), gene expression omnibus (geo) and proteomexchange database, we demonstrated its superior ability to recover biologically relevant modules and gene ontology (go) terms. further investigation of the colorectal cancer modules revealed numerous transcription factors and kegg pathways that played crucial roles in colorectal cancer progression. module-based survival analysis constructed four survival-related networks in which pairwise gene correlations were significantly correlated with colorectal cancer patient survival. overall, the series of evaluations demonstrated the great potential of correlation-based local approximation of membership for identifying modular biomarkers for complex diseases. we implemented correlation-based local approximation of membership as a user-friendly application available at https://github.com/free1234hm/clam.",AB_0396
"background and purpose: colorectal cancer is a common fatal malignancy, the fourth most common cancer in men, and the third most common cancer in women worldwide. timely detection of cancer in its early stages is essential for treating the disease. currently, there is a lack of datasets for histopathological image segmentation of colorectal cancer, which often hampers the assessment accuracy when computer technology is used to aid in diagnosis. methods: this present study provided a new publicly available enteroscope biopsy histopathological hematoxylin and eosin image dataset for image segmentation tasks (ebhi-seg). to demonstrate the validity and extensiveness of ebhi-seg, the experimental results for ebhi-seg are evaluated using classical machine learning methods and deep learning methods. results: the experimental results showed that deep learning methods had a better image segmentation performance when utilizing ebhi-seg. the maximum accuracy of the dice evaluation metric for the classical machine learning method is 0.948, while the dice evaluation metric for the deep learning method is 0.965. conclusion: this publicly available dataset contained 4,456 images of six types of tumor differentiation stages and the corresponding ground truth images. the dataset can provide researchers with new segmentation algorithms for medical diagnosis of colorectal cancer, which can be used in the clinical setting to help doctors and patients. ebhi-seg is publicly available at: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/ebhiseg/21540159/1.",AB_0396
"decades of overconsumption of antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections have resulted in the increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, which poses a significant challenge to public health, driving the urgent need to find alternatives to conventional antibiotics. bacteriophages are viruses infecting specific bacterial hosts, often destroying the infected bacterial hosts. phages attach to and enter their potential hosts using their tail proteins, with the composition of the tail determining the range of potentially infected bacteria. to aid the exploitation of bacteriophages for therapeutic purposes, we developed the phagetailfinder algorithm to predict tail-related proteins and identify the putative tail module in previously uncharacterized phages. the phagetailfinder relies on a two-state hidden markov model (hmm) to predict the probability of a given protein being tail-related. the process takes into account the natural modularity of phage tail-related proteins, rather than simply considering amino acid properties or secondary structures for each protein in isolation. the phagetailfinder exhibited robust predictive power for phage tail proteins in novel phages due to this sequence-independent operation. the performance of the prediction model was evaluated in 13 extensively studied phages and a sample of 992 complete phages from the ncbi database. the algorithm achieved a high true-positive prediction rate (> 80%) in over half (571) of the studied phages, and the roc value was 0.877 using general models and 0.968 using corresponding morphologic models. it is notable that the median roc value of 992 complete phages is more than 0.75 even for novel phages, indicating the high accuracy and specificity of the phagetailfinder. when applied to a dataset containing 189,680 viral genomes derived from 11,810 bulk metagenomic human stool samples, the roc value was 0.895. in addition, tail protein clusters could be identified for further studies by density-based spatial clustering of applications with the noise algorithm (dbscan). the developed phagetailfinder tool can be accessed either as a web server (http://www.microbiome-bigdata.com/phisdetector/index/tools/ phagetailfinder) or as a stand-alone program on a standard desktop computer (https://github.com/hit-immunologylab/phagetailfinder).",AB_0396
"background: heart failure (hf) is a serious and terminal stage of various cardiac diseases and the most common complication of coronary heart disease (chd). previous clinical studies have shown that qishen yiqi dropping pills (qsyq) have the effect of treating chronic heart failure. this study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and optimal effective dose of qsyq in treating chd complicating chronic hf with reduced ejection fraction (hfref). methods: we will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter clinical trial. a total of 228 individuals from 16 hospitals in china will be randomly assigned to the low-dose, high-dose, and placebo groups in a ratio of 1:1:1. the trial consists of a screening period (standard medical treatment for at least 2 weeks) and a 12-week treatment period. after randomization, follow-up will be conducted at the 4th, 8th and 12th week. the primary outcomes will be the 6-minute walk test (6mwt) at week 12. secondary outcomes will include 6mwt distance at week 4 and 8, new york heart association (nyha) functional classification, traditional chinese medicine (tcm) syndrome score, echocardiography indices, n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (ntprobnp), oxyhemoglobin saturation, minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (mlhfq) score, grasp strength body mass index test and cardiovascular adverse events (ae).ethics and dissemination: this trial has been approved by the research ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of guangzhou university of chinese medicine, china (approval number: zyyec [2021]005). written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. the results of this trial will be publicly shared through academic conferences and peer-reviewed journals.study registration: clinical trials registry (nct04983043, date: 07/08/2021, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04983043).",AB_0396
"background: as a severe morbidity during pregnancy, the etiology of spontaneous pregnancy loss (spl) remains largely unknown. serum glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) level is an established predictor of spl risk among women with diabetes, but little is known about whether such an association exists among pregnant women without diabetes when glycemic levels are within the normal range.objective: this study aimed to quantify the association between maternal hba1c levels in early pregnancy and subsequent spl risk in a cohort of pregnant women without diabetes.methods: this prospective cohort study involved 10,773 pregnant women without diabetes enrolled at their first antenatal care visit at a hospital's early pregnancy clinic from march 2016 to december 2018 in shanghai, china. hba1c and fasting blood glucose (fbg) levels were examined at enrollment. participants with diabetes before or pregnancy or those diagnosed with gestational diabetes were excluded. diagnosis of spl, defined as fetal death occurring before 28 gestational weeks, was derived from medical records and confirmed via telephone interviews. we used generalized linear models to quantify the associations of continuous and dichotomized maternal hba1c levels with spl risk and reported crude and adjusted risk ratios (rrs) and 95% cis. a restricted cubic spline (rcs) regression model was used to assess the potential nonlinear dose-response relationship. adjusted covariates included maternal age, education level, preconception bmi, gestational weeks, gravidity, history of adverse pregnancy outcomes, family history of diabetes, folic acid supplementation, and smoking and drinking during the periconception period.results: in total, 273 (2.5%) spl cases occurred. every 0.5% increase in hba1c levels was linearly associated with a 23% increase in spl risk (adjusted rr [arr] 1.23; 95% ci 1.01-1.50). the rcs model revealed that this association was linear (p=.77 for the nonlinearity test). analyses based on dichotomized hba(1c) levels showed a significantly increased risk of spl when hba1c levels were >= 5.9% (arr 1.67; 95% ci 0.67-3.67), and the significance threshold was >= 5.6% (arr 1.60; 95% ci 1.01-2.54). sensitivity analyses showed similar results when including the participants with missing spl records or hba(1c) data. linear associations of hba(1c) levels remained significant even in the subgroups without overweight, alcohol consumption, and a family history of diabetes and adverse pregnancy outcomes. every 1 mmol/l increment in maternal fbg levels was associated with a >2-fold higher risk of spl (arr 2.12; 95% ci 1.61-2.80; p<.001).conclusions: higher hba(1c) levels in early pregnant women without diabetes are associated with an increased spl risk in a dose-response manner. pregnant women with an hba(1c) level above 5.6% at early gestation need attention for its potentially increased risk for spl. our findings support the need to monitor hba(1c) levels to identify individuals at high risk of subsequent spl in the general population of pregnant women.trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02737644; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct02737644(jmir public health surveill 2023;9:e46986) doi: 10.2196/46986",AB_0396
"introduction: erectile dysfunction (ed) is a prevalent condition in urology, primarily managed with pde5 inhibitors (pde5is). however, approximately 20% of patients do not experience improvement in overall sexual satisfaction (os) after taking pde5is. among these, traditional chinese medicine (tcm) has emerged as a complementary approach, with formulas like hongjing i granules (hjig) showing promise in preliminary studies. this study aims to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness and safety of hjig in mild to moderate ed cases, assessing improvement in both sexual function and tcm pattern alignment.methods: this study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial. recruitment will be conducted from patients who have a strong willingness to try using only traditional chinese medicine treatment (this is very common in traditional chinese medicine hospitals.). a total of 100 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate ed caused by qi deficiency and blood stasis will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: hjig (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50). patients will receive 8 weeks of treatment and a 16-week follow-up starting from the fourth week of treatment. outcome measures, including the international index of erectile function-erectile function domain (iief-ef) score, sexual encounter profile (sep), and traditional chinese medicine symptom score, will be evaluated.discussion: the expected outcome of this trial is that the use of the herbal formula hijg alone can improve overall sexual satisfaction (os) in patients with mild to moderate ed, while also improving their traditional chinese medicine symptom scores. this will provide evidence-based support for the use of chinese medicine in the treatment of ed in china.trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry, chictr2000041127, registered on 19 december 2020, https://www.chictr.org. cn/showproj.html?proj=46469.trial status: recruitment began in march 2021, therefore 80 patients have been recruited. it is expected to finish recruiting in december 2023.",AB_0396
"background: alzheimer's disease (ad) is a common degenerative disease of the nervous system with serious impact on quality of life of patients and their families. with an aging population, ad has become a major public health problem in china and worldwide. however, the physiological and pathological mechanisms of ad have not been fully elucidated, and there is a lack of effective prevention and clinical treatment methods. many studies have found that traditional chinese medicine (tcm) has a good therapeutic effect on cognitive function in ad patients. bu shen kai qiao fang (bskqf) is one such chinese herbal preparation used in the treatment of ad. we designed a protocol for a real-world clinical study of bskqf combined with donepezil hydrochloride (dh) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach in the treatment of ad patients. methods: this is a protocol for a real-world, multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. the study will recruit 860 ad patients from four hospitals across china. equal numbers of patients will be treated with bskqf and dh or with dh only. the criteria for grouping are based primarily on patient preference. outcome measures include scores on the mini-mental state examination (mmse) and montreal cognitive assessment scale (moca) and will be recorded at baseline, and at one, two and three months after enrollment. the plasma a ss 42 and plasma tau levels of participating patients will also be measured by elisa at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. safety metrics and adverse events (aes) of participating patients will be monitored and recorded. discussion: this study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of bskqf in the treatment of ad. the results will provide reliable evidence for the clinical application of bskqf in the treatment of ad. study registration: trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry, no. chictr2000039670, registered 5 november 2020 https://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.html?proj=63800.",AB_0396
"purpose: the aim of this study is to develop and validate a predictive model for the prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis (ap) based on the intensive care database. patients and methods: we analyzed the data of patients with ap in the medical information mart for intensive care-iv (mimiciv) database and electronic intensive care unit collaborative research database (eicu-crd). then, patients from mimic-iv were divided into a development group and a validation group according to the ratio of 8:2, and eicu-crd was assigned as an external validation group. univariate logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for screening the best predictors, and multivariate logistic regression was used to establish a dynamic nomogram. we evaluated the discrimination, calibration, and clinical efficacy of the nomogram, and compared the performance of the nomogram with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii (apache-ii) score and bedside index of severity in ap (bisap) score.results: a total of 1030 and 514 patients with ap in mimic-iv database and eicu-crd were included in the study. after stepwise analysis, 8 out of a total of 37 variables were selected to construct the nomogram. the dynamic nomogram can be obtained by visiting https://model.sci-inn.com/kangzou/. the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) of the nomogram was 0.859, 0.871, and 0.847 in the development, internal, and external validation set respectively. the nomogram had a similar performance with apache-ii (auc = 0.841, p = 0.537) but performed better than bisap (auc = 0.690, p = 0.001) score in the validation group. moreover, the calibration curve presented a satisfactory predictive accuracy, and the decision curve analysis suggested great clinical application value of the nomogram.conclusion: based on the results of internal and external validation, the nomogram showed favorable discrimination, calibration, and clinical practicability in predicting the in-hospital mortality of patients with ap.",AB_0396
"we have obtained accurate dust reddening from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared for up to 5 million stars by the star-pair algorithm based on lamost stellar parameters along with galaxy evolution explorer, pan-starrs 1, gaia, sloan digital sky survey, two micron all sky survey, and wide-field infrared survey explorer photometric data. the typical errors are between 0.01 and 0.03 mag for most colors. we derived the empirical reddening coefficients for 21 colors both in the traditional (single-valued) way and as a function of t-eff and e(b - v) by using the largest samples of accurate reddening measurements, together with the extinction values from schlegel et al. the corresponding extinction coefficients have also been obtained. the results are compared with model predictions and generally in good agreement. comparisons with measurements in the literature show that the t-eff- and e(b - v)-dependent coefficients explain the discrepancies between different measurements naturally, i.e., using sample stars of different temperatures and reddening. our coefficients are mostly valid in the extinction range of 0-0.5 mag and the temperature range of 4000-10,000 k. we recommend that the new t-eff- and e(b - v)-dependent reddening and extinction coefficients should be used in the future. a python package is also provided for the usage of the coefficients (https://github.com/vnohhf/extinction_coeffcient/).",AB_0396
