"a genome carries many functional genomic signals and regions (gsrs), which play a vital role in orchestrating the complex biological processes in eukaryotic organisms. precise recognition of the gsrs within a genomic sequence is the first step to an understanding of genomic organization and gene regulation. previous studies have used machine learning or deep learning algorithms to identify gsrs based on hand-crafted features, that frequently fail to capture complex patterns within the gsrs. the one-hot encoding or word2vec embedding algorithms used in several deep learning-based studies have the potential to overcome the weakness of the human-designed features, but they may fail to capture contextual and positional information. the present study proposes a general-purpose end-to-end framework for gsr prediction (gsrnet), that integrates dnabert embedding, adversarial training, bigru, and multi-scale cnn to eliminate human involvement in feature engineering. the gsrnet is evaluated with polyadenylation signals (pas) and translation initiation sites (tis) prediction tasks. the comparative experiments show that the proposed gsrnet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods reported in previous studies, with a drop in the error rate by 1.08% and 1.50% for human pas and tis gsr, respectively. our model reduces the relative error rate up to 8.73% and 32.97%, respectively. the improved detections of the two types of gsrs (pas and tis) across four organisms confirmed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed gsrnet. the source code and the data are freely available at http://www.healthinfo rmaticslab.org/supp/resources.php.",AB_0170
"significance: due to caregiving commitments, caregivers of older adults may not have the time to make use of the onsite community services available to them during the day. with the support of advanced technology, telecare could be a convenient and easily accessible channel for providing individualized caregiving advice to caregivers. objective: the aim of the study is to describe a research protocol that highlights the development of a telecare-based intervention program for reducing stress levels in informal caregivers of community-dwelling older adults. methods: it is a randomized controlled trial. the study is supported by two community centers. the study participants will be randomly assigned to either the telecare-based intervention group or the control group. the former will receive a 3-month program comprised of three components: online nurse case management supported by a health and social care team, an online resource center, and a discussion forum. the latter will receive the usual services that provided by the community centers. data will be collected at two time points pre-intervention (t1) and post-intervention (t2). the primary outcome is stress levels, while secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, depression levels, quality of life, and caregiving burden. discussion: besides taking care of one or more older adults, informal caregivers have to deal with work, chores, and take care of their children. this study will add valuable information to the knowledge gap on whether telecare-based interventions with the support of an integrated health-social team can alleviate the stress levels of informal caregivers of community-dwelling older adults. if successful, policymakers and healthcare professionals should consider incorporating telecare modalities in a primary health setting for informal caregivers to correspond with them, to relieve their caregiving stress and promote a healthy life. clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/, nct05636982.",AB_0170
"background and objective: accurate and efficient segmentation of thyroid nodules on ultrasound im-ages is critical for computer-aided nodule diagnosis and treatment. for ultrasound images, convolutional neural networks (cnns) and transformers, which are widely used in natural images, cannot obtain sat-isfactory segmentation results, because they either cannot obtain precise boundaries or segment small objects. methods: to address these issues, we propose a novel boundary-preserving assembly trans-former unet (bpat-unet) for ultrasound thyroid nodule segmentation. in the proposed network, a bound-ary point supervision module (bpsm), which adopts two novel self-attention pooling approaches, is de-signed to enhance boundary features and generate ideal boundary points through a novel method. mean-while, an adaptive multi-scale feature fusion module (amffm) is constructed to fuse features and chan-nel information at different scales. finally, to fully integrate the characteristics of high-frequency local and low-frequency global, the assembled transformer module (atm) is placed at the bottleneck of the network. the correlation between deformable features and features-among computation is characterized by introducing them into the above two modules of amffm and atm. as the design goal and even-tually demonstrated, bpsm and atm promote the proposed bpat-unet to further constrain boundaries, whereas amffm assists to detect small objects. results: compared to other classical segmentation net-works, the proposed bpat-unet displays superior segmentation performance in visualization results and evaluation metrics. significant improvement of segmentation accuracy was shown on the public thyroid dataset of tn3k with dice similarity coefficient (dsc) of 81.64 % and 95th percentage of the asymmet-ric hausdorff distance (hd95) of 14.06, whereas those on our private dataset were with dsc of 85.63 % and hd95 of 14.53, respectively. conclusions: this paper presents a method for thyroid ultrasound im-age segmentation, which achieves high accuracy and meets the clinical requirements. code is available at https://github.com/ccjcv/bpat-unet .& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0170
"as a fundamental task for geographical information updating, 3d city modeling, and other critical applications, the automatic extraction of building footprints from high-resolution remote sensing images has been substan-tially explored and received increasing attention over recent years. among different types of building extraction methods, the polygonal segmentation methods produce vector building polygons that are in a more realistic format compared with those obtained from pixel-wise semantic labeling and contour-based methods. however, existing polygonal building segmentation methods usually require a perfect segmentation map and a complex post-processing procedure to guarantee the polygonization quality, or produce inaccurate vertex prediction results that suffer from wrong vertex sequence, self-intersections, fixed vertex quantity, etc. in our previous work, we have proposed a method for polygonal building segmentation from remote sensing images that addresses the above limitations of existing methods. in this paper, we propose polycity, which further extends and improves our previous work in terms of the application scenario, methodology design, and experimental results. our proposed polycity contains the following three components: (1) a pixel-wise multi-task network for learning the semantic and geometric information via three tasks, i.e., building segmentation, boundary prediction, and edge orientation prediction; (2) a simple but effective vertex selection module (vsm), which effectively bridges the gap between pixel-wise and graph-based models via transforming the segmentation map into valid polygon vertices; (3) a graph-based vertex refinement network (vrn) for automatically adjusting the coordinates of vsm-generated valid polygon vertices, producing the final building polygons with more precise vertices. results on three large-scale building extraction datasets demonstrate that our proposed polycity generates vector building footprints with more accurate vertices, edges, shapes, etc., achieving significant vertex score improvements while maintaining high segmentation and boundary scores compared with the current state-of-the-art. the code of polycity will be released at https://github.com/liweijia/polycity.",AB_0170
"due to the critical role of pavement crack detection for road maintenance and eventually ensuring safety, remarkable efforts have been devoted to this research area, and such a trend is further intensified for the coming unmanned vehicle era. however, such crack detection task still remains unexpectedly challenging in practice since the appearance of both cracks and the background are diverse and complex in real scenarios. in this work, we propose an automatic pavement crack detection method via synergizing low rank representation (lrr) and deep learning techniques. first, leveraging lrr which facilitates anomaly detection without making any specific assumption, we can easily discriminate most of the frames with cracks from the long sequence with a consistent pavement base, followed by a straightforward algorithm to localize the cracks. in order to achieve the intelligence of detecting cracks with different pavement basis under unconstrained imaging conditions, we resort to deep learning techniques and propose a deep convolutional neural network for crack detection leveraging on multi-level features and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (aspp). we train this network based on the training data obtained in the previous stage in an end-to-end manner. extensive experiments on a wide range of pavements demonstrate the high performance in terms of both accuracy and automaticity. moreover, the dataset generated by us is much more extensive and challenging than public ones. we put it online at https://gaozhinuswhu.com to benefit the community.",AB_0170
"this paper proposes a alternate physics-informed neural network (pinn) with a two-stage training strategy to solve the thermoelastic coupling in the growth of czochralski silicon single crystal. particularly, neural networks with a two-stage training strategy are established for solving partial differential equations in the thermoelastic coupling model. at present, pinn still faces challenges in solving coupling models. especially for the imbalance between and within equations in the coupling model. to solve this problem, this paper splits the model into two independent systems with their coupling term exchanged in the alternating iteration. then, the imbalance inside a single solution of the coupling model is solved by the proposed two-stage training strategy, and the imbalance between solutions is avoided by alternative iterations. experimental results show that the proposed alternate two-stage pinn (atpinn) can accurately simulate the temperature and displacement in the thermoelastic coupling model. compared with the finite element results, the error of temperature prediction and displacement prediction is acceptable. the numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the atpinn. furthermore, atpinn can be extended to any type of coupling model, especially for coupling models with large differences in the magnitudes of the loss functions. the codes developed in this manuscript are publicy available at https://github.com/callmedrcom/atpinn.",AB_0170
"research on action and inaction in judgement and decision making has shown that for choices in risky situations resulting in negative outcomes, people tend to prefer inaction over action and regret actions more than inactions. we built on this idea to test whether the established norm preference for inaction over action affects evaluations of decision-makers, and results in stronger preference for an agent who favors inaction over action in risky decisions resulting in negative outcomes. we conducted three pre-registered experiments via the prolific platform, replicating and further extending the classic action-effect paradigm (overall n = 1138, 355 male, 746 female, 37 others, mage= 36.98, sdage= 12.34) to examine perceptions of competence and trustworthiness of action versus inaction agents. first, we successfully replicated action-effect (d = 0.58 to 0.96). we then found that participants indeed tended to evaluate an inaction protagonist as more competent, trustworthy, and inline with social norms than an action protagonist (d = 0.05 to d = 0.61). results concerning our extensions examining perceived social norms and joy attributions over positive outcomes were less clear. finally, we found that normality moderated the preference-inaction effect into a preference-action effect: negative prior outcomes led participants to prefer action actors to inaction actors and to find those to be more competent and normative. overall, we found that, in the context of negative outcomes, inaction is perceived as more trustworthy than action. we concluded that action and inaction seem to extend to social evaluations of agents and that trustworthiness can be affected by action and inaction, context, and norms. all materials, data, and code are available on: https://osf.io/a8e4d/",AB_0170
