"background: hypersensitivity to light is a common symptom associated with dysfunction of the occipital region. earlier studies also suggested that clinically significant right-to-left shunt (rls) could increase occipital cortical excitability associated with the occurrence of migraine. the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between rls and photosensitivity. methods: this cross-sectional observational study included the residents aged 18-55 years living in the mianzhu community between november 2021 and october 2022. photosensitivity was evaluated using the photosensitivity assessment questionnaire along with baseline clinical data through face-to-face interviews. after the interviews, contrast-transthoracic echocardiography (ctte) was performed to detect rls. inverse probability weighting (ipw) was used to reduce selection bias. photosensitivity score was compared between individuals with and without significant rls usingmultivariable linear regression based on ipw. results: a total of 829 participants containing 759 healthy controls and 70 migraineurs were finally included in the analysis. multivariable linear regression analysis showed that migraine (fi = 0.422; 95% ci: 0.086-0.759; p = 0.014) and clinically significant rls (fi = 1.115; 95% ci: 0.760-1.470; p < 0.001) were related to higher photosensitivity score. subgroup analysis revealed that clinically significant rls had a positive e ect on hypersensitivity to light in the healthy population (fi = 0.763; 95% ci: 0.332-1.195; p < 0.001) or migraineurs (fi = 1.459; 95% ci: 0.271-2.647; p = 0.010). there was also a significant interaction between rls and migraine for the association with photophobia (pinteraction = 0.009). conclusion: rls is associated with photosensitivity independently and might exacerbate photophobia in migraineurs. future studies with rls closure are needed to validate the findings. trial registration: this study was registered at the chinese clinical trial register, natural population cohort study of west china hospital of sichuan university, id: chictr1900024623, url: https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj= 40590",AB_0177
"alzheimer's disease (ad), a neurodegenerative disease with no cure, affects millions of people worldwide and has become one of the biggest healthcare challenges. some investigated compounds play anti-ad roles at the cellular or the animal level, but their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. in this study, we designed a strategy combining network-based and structure-based methods together to identify targets for anti-ad sarsasapogenin derivatives (aas). first, we collected drug-target interactions (dtis) data from public databases, constructed a global dti network, and generated drug-substructure associations. after network construction, network-based models were built for dti prediction. the best bsdtnbi-fcfp_4 model was further used to predict dtis for aas. second, a structure-based molecular docking method was employed for rescreening the prediction results to obtain more credible target proteins. finally, in vitro experiments were conducted for validation of the predicted targets, and nrf2 showed significant evidence as the target of anti-ad compound aa13. moreover, we analyzed the potential mechanisms of aa13 for the treatment of ad. generally, our combined strategy could be applied to other novel drugs or compounds and become a useful tool in identification of new targets and elucidation of disease mechanisms. our model was deployed on our netinfer web server (http:// lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/netinfer/).",AB_0177
"in this paper, we rethink our earlier work on self-attention based crack segmentation, and propose an upgraded crackformer network (crackformer-ii) for pavement crack segmentation, instead of only for fine-grained crackdetection tasks. this work embeds novel transformer encoder modules into a segnet-like encoder-decoder structure, where the basic module is composed of novel transformer encoder blocks with effective relative positional embedding and long range interactions to extract efficient contextual information from feature-channels. further, fusion modules of scaling-attention are proposed to integrate the results of each respective encoder and decoder block to highlight semantic features and suppress nonsemantic ones. moreover, we update the transformer encoder blocks enhanced by the local feed-forward layer and skipconnections, and optimize the channel configurations to compress the model parameters. compared with the original crackformer, the crackformer-ii is trained and evaluated on more general crack datasets. it achieves higher accuracy than the original crackformer, and the state-of-the-art (sota) method with 6.7x fewer flops and 6.2x fewer parameters, and its practical inference speed is comparable to most classical cnn models. the experimental results show that it achieves the f-measures on optimal dataset scale (ods) of 0.912, 0.908, 0.914 and 0.869, respectively, on the four benchmarks. codes are available at https://github.com/louisnust/crackformer-ii.",AB_0177
"multi-view learning not only excavates the supplement information thoroughly, but also avoids noisy features and redundancies to improve down-stream tasks, e.g. cluster, by constructing the fusing model. however, in practices, it is difficult to obtain complete multi-view data, which is summarized as both of partially sample -missing problem (psp) originating from any view and partially view-unaligned problem (pvp). sure (robust multi-view clustering with incomplete information) builds up the novel loss function to remove the noisy sam-ples in the embedding space and presents the aligning method to solve both of pvp and psp. however, generated instances and relationships contain relatively little discriminate information and semantic consistency, more-over, it needs a large size of complete samples to pre-train. aiming to above problems, we propose the novel framework (termed synthetic multi-view data clustering, smdc). for psp problem, we induce feature -distillation in each feature-map level to generate features containing more semantic information helping with the guidance of complete feature-maps, furthermore, exploits self-distillation to strengthen the discriminability information of deeper levels supervised from the contrastive constraint in the embedding space. moreover, for pvp problem, we leverage attention mechanism to adaptively fuse multi-view features and auto-align instances located in different views. the proposed model is verified in images and video clustering tasks, respectively. comparing with popular methods achieve satisfactory performances. the code of model is published in: https://github.com/lnnu-computer-research-526/smdc.(c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v.",AB_0177
"background: most mobile cessation studies have found that such interventions have a higher quitting rate than interventions providing minimal smoking cessation support. however, why such interventions are effective has been almost unstudied by researchers. objective: this paper describes the principles of the personalized mobile cessation intervention-based wechat app and used generalized estimated equations to assess why a personalized mobile cessation intervention was more likely to promote smokers from the preparation stage to the action stage than a nonpersonalized intervention. methods: this is a 2-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in five cities in china. the intervention group received a personalized mobile cessation intervention. the control group received a nonpersonalized sms text message smoking cessation intervention. all information was sent by the wechat app. the outcomes were the change in protection motivation theory construct scores and the change in transtheoretical model stages. results: a total of 722 participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. compared with those who received the nonpersonalized sms text message intervention, smokers who received the personalized intervention presented lower intrinsic rewards, extrinsic rewards, and response costs. intrinsic rewards were determinants of stage change, thus explaining why the intervention group was more likely to promote smokers from the preparation stage to the action stage (odds ratio 2.65, 95% ci 1.41-4.98). conclusions: this study identified the psychological determinants at different stages to facilitate smokers moving forward to the next stage of quitting behavior and provides a framework to explore why a smoking cessation intervention is effective.trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry chictr2100041942; https://tinyurl.com/2hhx4m7f",AB_0177
"estimating three-dimensional (3d) human poses from two-dimensional (2d) joints has achieved promising results. however, there is relatively little work focused on exploiting domain-specific knowledge as prior. in this work, we present a learning framework based on prior knowledge for the task of estimating a 3d human pose from a 2d pose. in contrast to other state-of-the-art 3d pose estimation approaches, the proposed method is a systematic analysis pipeline that takes full advantage of prior knowledge based on three observations. the proposed approach can model the spatial and temporal relations between joints to achieve better performance. our approach formulates the learning network as an encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly encodes prior knowledge about the task. the encoder is a multi-head self-attention network which can capture human joint spatial relations. the decoder is formulated as three separated sub-networks, each sub-network represents a kinematic chain which is derived from our prior knowledge about human motion. the experimental results on the human3.6m, humaneva and mpi-inf-3dhp datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. the code and data are available at https://github.com/xtu-pr-lab/pk-san.",AB_0177
"the deep learning based super-resolution (sr) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress in the reconstruction of ideally simulated high-quality remote sensing image datasets. however, due to the large variation in image quality caused by the complex degradation factors, their performance decreases dramatically on real-world images acquired by different satellite sensors. to this end, we propose a cross-sensor sr framework that consists of a cross-sensor degradation modeling strategy for bridging the gap between the images obtained by the source and target sensors, and an edge-guided attention-based sr (egasr) network to promote the learning of high-frequency feature representation. specifically, we build a degradation pool on the low-resolution (lr) target sensor to produce a degraded training dataset simulated from the high-resolution (hr) images ob-tained by the source sensor. furthermore, the egasr network, which employs the edge-guided residual attention block (egrab) to introduce implicit edge prior to enhance edge-related information, is embedded in the cross -sensor sr framework for reconstructing hr results with sharp details. the proposed method is applied on images from the chinese gaofen (gf) satellite sensors and compared to several representative sr methods. an ideally simulated gf-2 lr/hr image set with only downsampling considered is first used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed egasr network. moreover, gf-2/gf-1 and gf-2/gf-6 cross-sensor sr datasets are constructed by synthesizing gf-2 degraded image pairs with the degradation pools estimated from the gf-1 and gf-6 images, respectively. the results show that: 1) the proposed egasr model shows superiority in reconstructing textural details and edge features, and achieves the best results among the state-of-art sr methods involved in com-parison; 2) the cross-sensor sr framework significantly promotes the model's ability to super-resolve real-world lr images acquired by the target satellite sensors, e.g., the niqe values are improved by at least 30% and 34% on average with respect to other comparative methods for gf-2/gf-1 and gf-2/gf-6 datasets in the real experi-ments, respectively. code is available at https://github.com/zhonghangqiu/egasr.",AB_0177
"data-driven methods have been in sight in ocean engineering for short-term vessel speed prediction. however, due to the requirements of large amounts of training data and the inevitable distributed inconsistency among datasets, they are not easy to generalize or achieve superior performance. specifically, inadequate recorded data of newly in-serviced vessels and ever-changing met-ocean climates making it hard to fulfill an accurate prediction in practice, and it is tough to be improved by merely raising new data-driven models. taking the case study of valemax vessels, we uncover that the input-output features have significant differences between datasets, which impair the effectiveness of data-driven models in practical use. with the purpose of designing domain-invariant features for data-driven models, we propose a domain-adapted feature transfer (daft), a generalized strategy to narrow the differences of distribution between datasets, which can be combined with a variety of models to form a framework for short-term vessel speed prediction. the superiority and generalization of daft are demonstrated through detailed experiments with quantitative and qualitative analyses. in addition, its robustness when faced with insufficient data and the feasibility of using data from sister-ships are also clearly verified. code is available at https://github.com/ldiper/daft.",AB_0177
"background we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a core-shell structured lipopolyplex (lpp) based covid-19 mrna vaccine, sw-bic-213, as a heterologous booster in healthy adults. methods we conducted an open-labeled, two-centered, and three-arm randomised phase 1 trial. healthy adults, who had completed a two-dose of inactivated covid-19 vaccine for more than six months, were enrolled and randomized to receive a booster dose of covilo (inactivated vaccine) (n = 20) or sw-bic-213-25 mu g (n = 20), or sw-bic-213-45 mu g (n = 20). the primary study endpoint was adverse events within 30 days post-boosting. the secondary endpoint was the titers of binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (wt) of sars-cov-2 as well as variants of concern in serum. the exploratory endpoint was the cellular immune responses. this trial was registered with http://www.chictr.org.cn (chictr2200060355).findings between jun 6 and jun 22, 2022, 60 participants were enrolled and randomized to receive a booster dose of sw-bic-213 (25 mu g, n = 20, or 45 mu g, n = 20) or covilo (n = 20). the baseline demographic characteristics of the participants at enrollment were similar among the treatment groups. for the primary outcome, injection site pain and fever were more common in the sw-bic-213 groups (25 mu g and 45 mu g). grade 3 fever was reported in 25% (5/20) of participants in the sw-bic-213-45 mu g group but was resolved within 48 h after onset. no fatal events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation were observed. for secondary and exploratory outcomes, sw-bic-213 elicited higher and longer humoral and cellular immune responses than that in the covilo group.interpretation sw-bic-213, a core-shell structured lipopolyplex (lpp) based mrna vaccine, was safe, tolerable, and immunogenic as a heterologous booster in healthy chinese adults. copyright (c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0177
"pansharpening refers to the super resolution of a low-resolution multispectral (lr-ms) image in virtue of an aligned panchromatic (pan) image. such an inverse problem mainly requires a proper use of the spatial information from the auxiliary pan image. in this paper, we suggest a nonconvex regularization model for pansharpening via framelet sparse reconstruction, called nc-fsrm, which investigates the coefficient similarity among the underlying high-resolution ms (hr-ms) and pan images on the framelet domain, then characterizes the strong statistical sparsity of their error using t0 norm. compared with previous methods, nc-fsrm can more precisely and concisely establish the relation between the underlying hr-ms and pan images. in particular, the piece-wise smoothness prior of the former can simultaneously be captured without adding additional regularizers. for solving the suggested nonconvex model, we further develop an efficient proximal alternating minimization (pam) based algorithm, which is theoretically proven to converge to the coordinatewise minimizers under some mild assumptions. numerical experiments conducted on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the suggested nc-fsrm compared with other stateof-the-art pansharpening methods. the source code is publicly available at https:// github. com/ zhongchengwu/ code_ncfsrm.",AB_0177
