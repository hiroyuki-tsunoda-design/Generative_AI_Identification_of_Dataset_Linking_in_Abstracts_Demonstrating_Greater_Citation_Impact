"this paper presents an evolved chimp optimization algorithm (choa) that uses greedy search (gs) and opposition-based learning (obl) to respectively increase the choa's capabilities for exploration and exploitation in addressing real practical engineering-constrained problems. in order to investigate the efficiency of the gsobl-choa, its performance is evaluated by twenty-three standard benchmark functions, 10 benchmark functions from cec06-2019, a randomly generated landscape, and 12 real practical constrained optimization problems (cops-2020) from a wide variety of engineering fields, including power system design, synthesis and process design, industrial chemical producer, power -electronic design, mechanical design, and animal feed ratio. the findings are compared to those obtained using benchmark optimizers such as cma-es and shade as state-of-the-art optimization techniques and cec competition winners; standard choa; obl-gwo, obl-ssa, and obl-csa as the best benchmark obl-based algorithms. in order to perform a comprehensive assessment, three non-parametric statistical tests, including the wilcoxon rank-sum, bonferroni-dunn and holm, and friedman average rank tests, are utilized. the top two algorithms are gsobl-choa and cma-es, with scores of forty and eleven, respectively, among 27 mathematical functions. jde100 obtained the highest score of 100 in the 100-digit challenge, followed closely by dishchain1e+12, which achieved the highest possible score of 97, and gsobl-choa obtained the fourth-highest score of 93. finally, gsobl-choa and cma-es outperform other benchmarks in five and four real practical cops, respectively. the source code of the paper can be downloaded using the following link: https://se.mathworks.com/ matlabcentral/fileexchange/119108-evolving-chimp-optimization-algorithm-by-weighted-opposition.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0028
"modules consisting of antibiotic resistance genes (args) flanked by inverted repeat xer-specific recombination sites were thought to be mobile genetic elements that promote horizontal transmission. less frequently, the presence of mobile modules in plasmids, which facilitate a pdif -mediated args transfer, has been reported. here, numerous args and toxin -antitoxin genes have been found in pdif site pairs. however, the mechanisms underlying this apparent genetic mobility is currently not understood, and the studies relating to pdifmediated args transfer onto most bacterial genera are lacking. we developed the web server pdiffinder based on an algorithm called pdifsm that allows the prediction of diverse pdif -args modules in bacterial genomes. using test set consisting of almost 32 thousand plasmids from 717 species, pdifsm identified 481 plasmids from various bacteria containing pdif sites with args. we found 28 -bp -long elements from different genera with clear base preferences. the data we obtained indicate that xercd-dif site -specific recombination mechanism may have evolutionary adapted to facilitate the pdif -mediated args transfer. through multiple sequence alignment and evolutionary analyses of duplicated pdif -args modules, we discovered that pdif sites allow an interspecies transfer of args but also across different genera. mutations in pdif sites generate diverse arrays of modules which mediate multidrug-resistance, as these contain variable numbers of diverse args, insertion sequences and other functional genes. the identification of pdif -args modules and studies focused on the mechanism of args co -transfer will help us to understand and possibly allow controlling the spread of mdr bacteria in clinical settings. the pdiffinder code, standalone software package and description with tutorials are available at https://github.comi mjshao06/pdiffinder.",AB_0028
"viruses are the most ubiquitous and diverse entities in the biome. due to the rapid growth of newly identified viruses, there is an urgent need for accurate and comprehensive virus classification, particularly for novel viruses. here, we present phagcn2, which can rapidly classify the taxonomy of viral sequences at the family level and supports the visualization of the associations of all families. we evaluate the performance of phagcn2 and compare it with the state-of-the-art virus classification tools, such as vcontact2, cat and vpf-class, using the widely accepted metrics. the results show that phagcn2 largely improves the precision and recall of virus classification, increases the number of classifiable virus sequences in the global ocean virome dataset (v2.0) by four times and classifies more than 90% of the gut phage database. phagcn2 makes it possible to conduct high -throughput and automatic expansion of the database of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses. the source code is freely available at https://github.com/kennthshang/phagcn2.0.",AB_0028
"one of key features of intrinsically disordered regions (idrs) is facilitation of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acids interactions. these disordered binding regions include molecular recognition features (morfs), short linear motifs (slims) and longer binding domains. vast majority of current predictors of disordered binding regions target morfs, with a handful of methods that predict slims and disordered protein -binding domains. a new and broader class of disordered binding regions, linear interacting peptides (lips), was introduced recently and applied in the mobidb resource. lips are segments in protein sequences that undergo disorderto -order transition upon binding to a protein or a nucleic acid, and they cover morfs, slims and disordered protein -binding domains. although current predictors of morfs and disordered protein -binding regions could be used to identify some lips, there are no dedicated sequence -based predictors of lips. to this end, we introduce clip, a new predictor of lips that utilizes robust logistic regression model to combine three complementary types of inputs: co -evolutionary information derived from multiple sequence alignments, physicochemical profiles and disorder predictions. ablation analysis suggests that the co -evolutionary information is particularly useful for this prediction and that combining the three inputs provides substantial improvements when compared to using these inputs individually. comparative empirical assessments using low-similarity test datasets reveal that clip secures area under receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) of 0.8 and substantially improves over the results produced by the closest current tools that predict morfs and disordered protein -binding regions. the webserver of clip is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/clip/ and the standalone code can be downloaded from http://yanglab.cid.sdu.edu.cntdownload/clipt.",AB_0028
"quantitative activity and species source data of natural products (nps) are important for drug discovery, medicinal plant research, and microbial investigations. activity values of nps against specific targets are useful for discovering targeted therapeutic agents and investigating the mechanism of medicinal plants. composition/concentration values of nps in individual species facilitate the assessments and investigations of the therapeutic quality of herbs and phenotypes of microbes. here, we describe an update of the npass natural product activity and species source database previously featured in nar. this update includes: (i) new data of similar to 95 000 records of the composition/concentration values of similar to 1 490 nps/np clusters in similar to 390 species, (ii) extended data of activity values of similar to 43 200 nps against similar to 7 700 targets (similar to 40% and similar to 32% increase, respectively), (iii) extended data of similar to 31 600 species sources of similar to 94 400 nps (similar to 26% and similar to 32% increase, respectively), (iv) new species types of similar to 440 co-cultured microbes and similar to 420 engineered microbes, (v) new data of similar to 66 600 nps without experimental activity values but with estimated activity profiles from the established chemical similarity tool chemical checker, (vi) new data of the computed drug-likeness properties and the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (admet) properties for all nps. npass update version is freely accessible at http://bidd.group/npass.",AB_0028
"protein-protein interactions play an important role in many biological processes. however, although structure prediction for monomer proteins has achieved great progress with the advent of advanced deep learning algorithms like alphafold, the structure prediction for protein-protein complexes remains an open question. taking advantage of the transformer model of esm-msa, we have developed a deep learning -based model, named deephomo2.0, to predict protein-protein interactions of homodimeric complexes by leveraging the direct-coupling analysis (dca) and transformer features of sequences and the structure features of monomers. deephomo2.0 was extensively evaluated on diverse test sets and compared with eight state-of-the-art methods including protein language model based, dca-based and machine learning -based methods. it was shown that deephomo2.0 achieved a high precision of >70% with experimental monomer structures and >60% with predicted monomer structures for the top 10 predicted contacts on the test sets and outperformed the other eight methods. moreover, even the version without using structure information, named deephomoseq, still achieved a good precision of >55% for the top 10 predicted contacts. integrating the predicted contacts into protein docking significantly improved the structure prediction of realistic critical assessment of protein structure prediction homodimeric complexes. deephomo2.0 and deephomoseq are available at http://huanglab.phys.hust.edu.cn/deephomo2/.",AB_0028
"microrna (mirna)-target interaction (mti) plays a substantial role in various cell activities, molecular regulations and physiological processes. published biomedical literature is the carrier of high -confidence mti knowledge. however, digging out this knowledge in an efficient manner from large-scale published articles remains challenging. to address this issue, we were motivated to construct a deep learning -based model. we applied the pre -trained language models to biomedical text to obtain the representation, and subsequently fed them into a deep neural network with gate mechanism layers and a fully connected layer for the extraction of mti information sentences. performances of the proposed models were evaluated using two datasets constructed on the basis of text data obtained from mirtarbase. the validation and test results revealed that incorporating both pubmedbert and scibert for sentence level encoding with the long short-term memory (lstm)-based deep neural network can yield an outstanding performance, with both f1 and accuracy being higher than 80% on validation data and test data. additionally, the proposed deep learning method outperformed the following machine learning methods: random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression and bidirectional lstm. this work would greatly facilitate studies on mti analysis and regulations. it is anticipated that this work can assist in large-scale screening of mirnas, thereby revealing their functional roles in various diseases, which is important for the development of highly specific drugs with fewer side effects. source code and corpus are publicly available at https://github.com/qi29.",AB_0028
"social relationships help to model user's potential preferences and improve recommendation accuracy. in social recommendation, user decision-making will be affected by his own historical interaction items and social friends. most social recommendations consider these two aspects separately, but users are also driven by both when making decisions. to address the above issue, this paper proposes an adaptive social recommendation method based on attention mechanism, adaptive social recommendation combine with multi-domain influence (asrm). specifically, we defined three domains, item domain, social domain, and common domain to measure the possible impact of social relations and item interactions on users. we propose an adaptive attention module to simulate users being influenced by social relations and historical interaction items in these three domains, and obtain user's potential preferences. in addition, we jointly optimize by calculating the loss of each domain, resulting in more accurate recommendations. a large number of experiments on three real datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. the code is available at https://github.com/qinkaili/asrm.",AB_0028
"multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (kgqa) aims to pinpoint answer entities by reasoning across multiple triples in knowledge graphs (kgs). to enhance model inter-pretability, reinforcement learning (rl) based methods are proposed. however, rl-based solutions suffer from two major issues. the first is aimless exploration due to the limited observation information. the second is delayed and sparse rewards caused by weak super-vision. to bridge the gap, we propose an interpretable model based on rl for multi-hop kgqa with weak supervision, which we refer to as anticipation reasoning network (arn) that incorporates kg embeddings as anticipation information into rl framework to avoid aimlessly traversing in kg. arn achieves the goal via three steps. (1) kg embed-ding models represent the entities and relations as low-dimensional vectors. (2) we pro-pose a knowledge embedding based question answering (keqa) framework to measure the plausibility of the triple in embedding space. (3) a policy-guided agent is designed to perform effective path reasoning by selecting the most promising action at each step. moreover, we utilize reward shaping strategy and actor-critic optimization to alleviate the problem of low-quality rewards. extensive experiments well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method footnotefor reproducibil-ity, we publicly release the code at https://github.com/idylancui/arn.(c) 2022 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0028
"to fully exploit the strong exploitation of differential evolution (de) and the strong exploration of the estimation-of-distribution algorithm (eda), an improved differential evolution by hybridizing the estimation-of-distribution algorithm named ide-eda is proposed in the study. firstly, a novel cooperative evolutionary framework is proposed to hybridize lshade-rsp, a state-of-the-art de variant incorporating de-based effective improvement strategies, with eda. secondly, the dominant individuals generated by lshade-rsp are used to establish the probability distribution model for eda to enhance its exploitation in each generation, and a new control parameter is introduced to balance exploitation and exploration. then, the use of greed strategy works via eda to fully retain highquality solutions to the next generation to improve the convergence speed. finally, the greedy strategy is used to shrink the external archive when its size decreases due to the reduction of the population size. a comparison of ide-eda with cutting-edge de-based and eda-based variants, including aavs-eda, eb-lshade, elshade-spacma, jso, lshade-rsp, rwgeda, hses, and apgsk-imode, was implemented to verify its efficiency. the statistical test results on the ieee cec 2018 and ieee cec 2021 test suites demonstrate that ide-eda is an excellent hybrid algorithm. the matlab source code of ide-eda can be downloaded from https://github.com/yintong-li/ide-eda.
