"background:short-term forecasts of infectious disease burden can contribute to situational awareness and aid capacity planning. based on best practice in other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are combined into an ensemble. here, we report on the performance of ensembles in predicting covid-19 cases and deaths across europe between 08 march 2021 and 07 march 2022.methods:we used open-source tools to develop a public european covid-19 forecast hub. we invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for covid-19 cases and deaths reported by a standardised source for 32 countries over the next 1-4 weeks. teams submitted forecasts from march 2021 using standardised quantiles of the predictive distribution. each week we created an ensemble forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th july the median) of all individual models' predictive quantiles. we measured the performance of each model using the relative weighted interval score (wis), comparing models' forecast accuracy relative to all other models. we retrospectively explored alternative methods for ensemble forecasts, including weighted averages based on models' past predictive performance.results:over 52 weeks, we collected forecasts from 48 unique models. we evaluated 29 models' forecast scores in comparison to the ensemble model. we found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance across countries over time. across all horizons and locations, the ensemble performed better on relative wis than 83% of participating models' forecasts of incident cases (with a total n=886 predictions from 23 unique models), and 91% of participating models' forecasts of deaths (n=763 predictions from 20 models). across a 1-4 week time horizon, ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting cases, but remained stable over 4 weeks for incident death forecasts. in every forecast across 32 countries, the ensemble outperformed most contributing models when forecasting either cases or deaths, frequently outperforming all of its individual component models. among several choices of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of methods of weighting component forecast models.conclusions:our results support the use of combining forecasts from individual models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics. our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better predictive performance more than ones based on means. our findings also highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death forecasts than incident case forecasts at forecast horizons greater than 2 weeks.funding:aa, bh, bl, lwa, mma, pp, sv funded by national institutes of health (nih) grant 1r01gm109718, nsf big data grant iis-1633028, nsf grant no.: oac-1916805, nsf expeditions in computing grant ccf-1918656, ccf-1917819, nsf rapid cns-2028004, nsf rapid oac-2027541, us centers for disease control and prevention 75d30119c05935, a grant from google, university of virginia strategic investment fund award number sif160, defense threat reduction agency (dtra) under contract no. hdtra1-19-d-0007, and respectively virginia dept of health grant vdh-21-501-0141, vdh-21-501-0143, vdh-21-501-0147, vdh-21-501-0145, vdh-21-501-0146, vdh-21-501-0142, vdh-21-501-0148. af, ama, gl funded by smige - modelli statistici inferenziali per governare l'epidemia, fisr 2020-covid-19 i fase, fisr2020ip-00156, codice progetto: prj-0695. am, bk, fd, fr, jk, jn, jz, kn, mg, mr, ms, rb funded by ministry of science and higher education of poland with grant 28/wfsn/2021 to the university of warsaw. bre, cpe, jlaz funded by ministerio de sanidad/isciii. bt, pg funded by periscope european h2020 project, contract number 101016233. cp, dl, ea, mc, sa funded by european commission - directorate-general for communications networks, content and technology through the contract lc-01485746, and ministerio de ciencia, innovacion y universidades and feder, with the project pgc2018-095456-b-i00. de., mgu funded by spanish ministry of health / react-ue (feder). do, gf, imi, lc funded by laboratory directed research and development program of los alamos national laboratory (lanl) under project number 20200700er. ds, elr, gg, ngr, nw, yw funded by national institutes of general medical sciences (r35gm119582;

"for many real world applications, such as stock price prediction and video frame synthesis, sequential data prediction is a fundamental and challenging task. considering the temporal features of sequential data, existing approaches generally adopt recurrent neural network and its variants for the prediction. however, for sequences with complex structure, these approaches cannot guarantee to obtain promising results. in this paper, to address the above issue, we formulate sequential data prediction as a self-supervised generative learning problem. concretely, we design a generator to learn the distribution of the sequential data and generate the predicted values, as well as a discriminator to judge whether or not the input sequential data are real or fake. based on this proposed framework and the adversarial learning scheme, we develop the corresponding networks for vector inputs and high-order tensor inputs, respectively, which are respectively named vector generative network (vgn) and high-order tensor generative network (htgn). extensive experiments on five stock price prediction datasets and two video frame prediction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, and its advantages over the state-of-the-art approaches. our main code and the used data have been shared at https://github.com/xsavagek/ssgl.",AB_0107
"bacterial phylogenetic analyses are commonly performed to explore the evolutionary relationships among various bacterial species and genera based on their 16s rrna gene sequences; however, these results are limited by mosaicism, intragenomic heterogeneity, and difficulties in distinguishing between related species. in this study, we aimed to perform genome-wide comparisons of different bacterial species, namely escherichia coli, shigella, yersinia, klebsiella, and neisseria spp., based on their k-mer profiles to construct phylogenetic trees. pentanucleotide frequency analyses (512 patterns of 5 nucleotides each) were performed to distinguish between highly similar species. moreover, escherichia albertii strains were clearly distinguished from e. coli and shigella, despite being closely related to enterohemorrhagic e. coli in the phylogenetic tree. in addition, our phylogenetic tree of ipomoea species based on pentamer frequency in chloroplast genomes was correlated with previously reported morphological similarities. furthermore, a support vector machine clearly classified e. coli and shigella genomes based on their pentanucleotide profiles. these results suggest that phylogenetic analyses based on penta- or hexamer profiles are a useful methodology for microbial phylogenetic studies. in addition, we introduced an r application, phy5, which generates a phylogenetic tree based on genome-wide comparisons of pentamer profiles. the online version of phy5 can be accessed at https://phy5.shinyapps.io/phy5r/ and its command line version phy5cli can be downloaded at https://github.com/yoshionakano2021/phy5.",AB_0107
"background: nighttime blood pressure (bp) and an abnormal nocturnal bp dipping profile are important cardiovascular risk factors in patients with hypertension. this post hoc analysis investigated the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on 24-hour bp in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and in patient subgroups based on nocturnal bp dipping status. methods and results: data from a randomized clinical trial comparing the bp-lowering effects of 8 weeks of treatment with sacubitril/valsartan (200 or 400 mg/d) and olmesartan (20 mg/d) in japanese patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were analyzed. the primary end point was change in 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime bp in patient subgroups based on nocturnal bp dipping status (dipper, nondipper). six hundred thirty-two patients with baseline and follow-up ambulatory bp data were included. both sacubitril/valsartan dosages reduced 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime systolic bp, and 24-hour and daytime diastolic bp, to a significantly greater extent than olmesartan in the dipper and nondipper groups. however, between-group differences in nighttime systolic bp were more significant in the nondipper group (difference [95% ci] for sacubitril/valsartan 200 and 400 mg/d versus olmesartan 20 mg/d: -4.6 [95% ci, -7.3 to -1.8] and -6.8 [95% ci, -9.5 to -4.1] mm hg, respectively; p<0.01 and p<0.001). between-group differences in the bp control rate were greatest in the nondipper subgroup (systolic bp control rate of 34.4% and 42.6% with sacubitril/valsartan 200 and 400 mg/d versus 23.1% with olmesartan 20 mg/d). conclusions: this analysis highlights the value of sacubitril/valsartan therapy in patients with a nondipper profile of nocturnal bp and confirms this agent's potent 24-hour bp-lowering effect in japanese populations with hypertension. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct01599104.",AB_0107
"deep reinforcement learning with domain randomization learns a control policy in various simulations with randomized physical and sensor model parameters to become transferable to the real world in a zero-shot setting. however, a huge number of samples are often required to learn an effective policy when the range of randomized parameters is extensive due to the instability of policy updates. to alleviate this problem, we propose a sample-efficient method named cyclic policy distillation (cpd). cpd divides the range of randomized parameters into several small sub-domains and assigns a local policy to each one. then local policies are learned while cyclically transitioning to sub-domains. cpd accelerates learning through knowledge transfer based on expected performance improvements. finally, all of the learned local policies are distilled into a global policy for sim-to-real transfers. cpd's effectiveness and sample efficiency are demonstrated through simulations with four tasks (pendulum from openaigym and pusher, swimmer, and halfcheetah from mujoco), and a real-robot, ball-dispersal task. we published code and videos from our experiments at https://github.com/yuki-kadokawa/cyclicpolicy-distillation.",AB_0107
"prevalent paradigms for edge detection tend to use extra data in a mixed training manner, which can increase the data diversity of training samples; however, a part of extra data may improve their performances, while the other will degrade their performances. this paper first proposes a selective training method to select positive data for improving the corresponding performance. secondly, to properly use the negative data which may degrade the performance in previous schemes, an adaptive training method is also proposed by introducing a similarity-preserving self-distillation mechanism based on a teacher-student network, which can maintain equivalent performance to the selective one, and simultaneously achieves better generalization ability. compared with the state-of-the-art method in cvpr 2022, our schemes achieve 0.5% and 7.6% improvement of the ods f-scores for the data sets bsds and pascal, respectively. experimental results on the benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. our source code and model parameters will be released at https://github. com/wenya1994/boosting-ed.",AB_0107
"weeds can give negative effects for plant growth, and effectively controlling them is a significant challenge. traditional methods, such as herbicides, may not be environmentally friendly, and manual weeding can be costly. the laser-based weeding is a potentially alternative way of weeding in an environmentally friendly way. growing point detection and their pin-point striking would be more desirable in the laser-based weeding technology. in this study, we propose an encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network with a dual decoder branch to detect the growing point of weeds. the decoder incorporates spatial and channel attention, as well as a novel activation gate mechanism to control the attention. we also present a simple yet effective strategy for combining the outputs of the decoder branches. the proposed method was tested on a real field dataset containing various growing stages of weeds and was compared to state-of-the-art methods using point -based metrics. the results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, with a detection rate of 0.8505, precision of 0.8641, miss rate of 0.1391, rmse of 22.68, and mae of 17.95. the implementation code can be accessed at https://github.com/dewamsa/wgpdetection.git.",AB_0107
"robotic cutting of soft materials is critical for applications such as food processing, household automation, and surgical manipulation. as in other areas of robotics, simulators can facilitate controller verification, policy learning, and dataset generation. moreover, differentiable simulators can enable gradient-based optimization, which is invaluable for calibrating simulation parameters and optimizing controllers. in this work, we present disect: the first differentiable simulator for cutting soft materials. the simulator augments the finite element method with a continuous contact model based on signed distance fields, as well as a continuous damage model that inserts springs on opposite sides of the cutting plane and allows them to weaken until zero stiffness, enabling crack formation. through various experiments, we evaluate the performance of the simulator. we first show that the simulator can be calibrated to match resultant forces and deformation fields from a stateof-the-art commercial solver and real-world cutting datasets, with generality across cutting velocities and object instances. we then show that bayesian inference can be performed efficiently by leveraging the differentiability of the simulator, estimating posteriors over hundreds of parameters in a fraction of the time of derivative-free methods. next, we illustrate that control parameters in the simulation can be optimized to minimize cutting forces via lateral slicing motions. finally, we conduct experiments on a real robot arm equipped with a slicing knife to infer simulation parameters from force measurements. by optimizing the slicing motion of the knife, we show on fruit cutting scenarios that the average knife force can be reduced by more than 40% compared to a vertical cutting motion. we publish code and additional materials on our project website at https://diff-cutting-sim.github.io.",AB_0107
"satellite radar backscatter contains unique information on land surface moisture, vegetation features, and surface roughness and has thus been used in a range of earth science disciplines. however, there is no single global radar data set that has a relatively long wavelength and a decades-long time span. we here provide the first long-term (since 1992), high-resolution ( similar to 8 :9 km instead of the commonly used similar to 25 km resolution) monthly satellite radar backscatter data set over global land areas, called the long-term, high-resolution scatterometer (lhscat) data set, by fusing signals from the european remote sensing satellite (ers; 1992-2001; c-band; 5.3 ghz), quick scatterometer (qscat, 1999-2009; ku-band; 13.4 ghz), and the advanced scatterometer (ascat; since 2007; c-band; 5.255 ghz). the 6-year data gap between c-band ers and ascat was filled by modelling a substitute c-band signal during 1999-2009 from ku-band qscat signals and climatic information. to this end, we first rescaled the signals from different sensors, pixel by pixel. we then corrected the monthly signal differences between the c-band and the scaled ku-band signals by modelling the signal differences from climatic variables (i.e. monthly precipitation, skin temperature, and snow depth) using decision tree regression. the quality of the merged radar signal was assessed by computing the pearson r, root mean square error (rmse), and relative rmse (rrmse) between the c-band and the corrected ku-band signals in the overlapping years (1999-2001 and 2007-2009). we obtained high pearson r values and low rmse values at both the regional ( r >= 0 :92, rmse <= 0.11 db, and rrmse <= 0.38) and pixel levels (median r across pixels >= 0.64, median rmse <= 0.34 db, and median rrmse <= 0.88), suggesting high accuracy for the data-merging procedure. the merged radar signals were then validated against the european space agency (esa) ers-2 data, which provide observations for a subset of global pixels until 2011, even after the failure of on-board gyroscopes in 2001. we found highly concordant monthly dynamics between the merged radar signals and the esa ers-2 signals, with regional pearson r values ranging from 0.79 to 0.98. these results showed that our merged radar data have a consistent c-band signal dynamic. the lhscat data set (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20407857; tao et al., 2023) is expected to advance our understanding of the long-term changes in, e.g., global vegetation and soil moisture with a high spatial resolution. the data set will be updated on a regular basis to include the latest images acquired by ascat and to include even higher spatial and temporal resolutions.",AB_0107
"the number of leaves at a given time is important to characterize plant growth and development. in this work, we developed a high-throughput method to count the number of leaves by detecting leaf tips in rgb images. the digital plant phenotyping platform was used to simulate a large and diverse dataset of rgb images and corresponding leaf tip labels of wheat plants at seedling stages (150,000 images with over 2 million labels). the realism of the images was then improved using domain adaptation methods before training deep learning models. the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method evaluated on a diverse test dataset, collecting measurements from 5 countries obtained under different environments, growth stages, and lighting conditions with different cameras (450 images with over 2,162 labels). among the 6 combinations of deep learning models and domain adaptation techniques, the faster-rcnn model with cycle-consistent generative adversarial network adaptation technique provided the best performance (r2 = 0.94, root mean square error = 8.7). complementary studies show that it is essential to simulate images with sufficient realism (background, leaf texture, and lighting conditions) before applying domain adaptation techniques. furthermore, the spatial resolution should be better than 0.6 mm per pixel to identify leaf tips. the method is claimed to be self-supervised since no manual labeling is required for model training. the self-supervised phenotyping approach developed here offers great potential for addressing a wide range of plant phenotyping problems. the trained networks are available at https:// github.com/yinglunli/wheat-leaf-tip-detection.",AB_0107
