"inactivated aluminum-adsorbed hepatitis a vaccines such as havrix, vaqta, and avaxim are commonly used worldwide. these vaccines are typically administered in a two-dose series (at 0 and 6-12 months). however, a lyophilized inactivated aluminum-free hepatitis a vaccine, aimmugen, which is approved in japan, is typically administered in a three-dose series (at 0, 2-4, and 24 weeks). hence, individuals vis-iting endemic hepatitis a areas receive the primary two doses of aimmugen before traveling and the third booster dose much later. it is currently uncertain whether boosting with a delayed third dose of aimmugen is effective, or whether a new vaccination schedule should instead be initiated. therefore, we investigated the anti-hepatitis-a viral immune response of adult travelers who received the third dose of aimmugen more than 24 weeks after the first dose.participants were vaccinated with the third dose of aimmugen more than 2 years after the first two doses. antibody titers were measured at day 0 (prevaccination) and at 28-42 days after the third dose of aimmugen. twenty-nine adult participants were enrolled in the study (14 men and 15 women; mean age & plusmn; standard deviation age, 36.2 & plusmn; 8.1 years). the interval between the first two doses and the third dose was 3-14 years. the seroprotection rate (i.e., the percentage of participants with anti-hepatitis a virus antibody titers > 10 miu/ml) was 96.6 % (28/29) at day 0 and increased to 100% (29/29) at days 28- 42. geometric mean concentration increased from 105 to 4,013 miu/ml. we demonstrated that delaying the third dose of aimmugen still elicited effective immune responses after priming with two doses of the vaccine.trial registration: umin clinical trials registry (umin-ctr): min000013624. registered 03 april 2014. https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi-bin/ctr/ctr_view_reg.cgi?recptno=r000015906. & copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0095
"elucidation of activation barriers is essential to understand the energetics of chemical reactions. transition states (tss) are the key information necessary to evaluate activation barriers. among various methods, the multicoordinate driven (mcd) method is particularly useful for searching tss because it requires simple inputs but shows high reliability with reasonable computation costs. this method starts from reactants and generates a reaction path by scanning multiple active coordinates until it arrives at the products, eventually leading to a ts and the corresponding activation barrier. despite its high reliability, however, the source code is not publicly available. herein, we present a python package, hereafter referred to as pymcd that searches for tss using the mcd method. we slightly revised the original mcd method proposed by berente and coworkers [1] to improve its computational efficiency while minimizing loss of accuracy. the package is extremely user-friendly, requiring minimal effort from users for input preparation. moreover, it is well organized, so users can readily customize it for their purposes. the current version has been interfaced with gaussian and orca, but can be interfaced with any quantum chemistry package by slightly modifying the source code. we demonstrated the high reliability of the revised method by testing it with various chemical reactions.program summary program title: pymcdcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /wb6r97mb5s .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /kyunghoonlee777 /pymcd .gitlicensing provisions: bsd-3-clauseprogramming language: pythonsupplementary material:1. input files for the results section (input_files.tar)2. output files of the results section (output_files.tar)3. manual for installing and running pymcd (manual.pdf)nature of problem: rapid and reliable transition state (ts) exploration is challenging because tss are saddle points on the potential energy surface of chemical reactions. the multicoordinate driven (mcd) method was proposed as a powerful approach for ts searching with various advantages, including high reliability and convenience of its use. unfortunately, neither the source code nor any executable version of it is publicly available.solution method: we provide a python package, namely, pymcd, that can search tss using the mcd method. the method was implemented in python with high-performance and user-friendly environments. our test study demonstrated the high reliability of our implementation. the code structure is well organized, so users can easily customize it for their purposes. moreover, it can be readily interfaced with any quantum chemistry software with minimal effort. at present, it has been interfaced with gaussian and orca.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0095
"background: collecting blood cultures from indwelling arterial catheters is an attractive option in critically ill adult patients when peripheral venipuncture is difficult. however, whether the contamination proportion of blood cultures from arterial catheters is acceptable compared with that from venipuncture is inconclusive. research question: is contamination of blood cultures from arterial catheters noninferior to that from venipuncture in critically ill adult patients with suspected bloodstream infection?study design and methods: in this multicenter prospective diagnostic study conducted at five hospitals, we enrolled episodes of paired blood culture collection, each set consisting of blood drawn from an arterial catheter and another by venipuncture, were obtained from critically ill adult patients with cilinical indication. the primary measure was the proportion of contami-nation, defined as the number of false-positive results relative to the total number of procedures done. the reference standard for true bloodstream infection was blinded assessment by infectious disease specialists. we examined the noninferiority hypothesis that the contamination proportion of blood cultures from arterial catheters did not exceed that from venipuncture by 2.0%.results: of 1,655 episodes of blood culture from december 2018 to july 2021, 590 paired blood culture episodes were enrolled, and 41 of the 590 episodes (6.9%) produced a true bloodstream infection. in blood cultures from arterial catheters, 33 of 590 (6.0%) were positive, and two of 590 (0.3%) were contaminated; in venipuncture, 36 of 590 (6.1%) were positive, and four of 590 (0.7%) were contaminated. the estimated difference in contami-nation proportion (arterial catheter - venipuncture) was -0.3% (upper limit of one-sided 95% ci, +0.3%). the upper limit of the 95% ci did not exceed the predefined margin of +2.0%, establishing noninferiority (p for noninferiority < .001). interpretation: obtaining blood cultures from arterial catheters is an acceptable alternative to venipuncture in critically ill patients. clinical trial registration: university hospital medical information network center (umin-ctr); no.: umin000035392; url: https://center6.umin.ac.jp/",AB_0095
"background: we evaluated heart rate (hr) and blood pressure (bp) trends when nicardipine (ncd) was co-administered during dexmedetomidine (dex) sedation after spinal anesthesia. methods: sixty patients aged 19 to 65 were randomly assigned to the dex or dex-ncd groups. five minutes after infusion of the loading dose of dex, the ncd was administered intravenously at a rate of 5 mu g/kg for 5 minutes in the dex-ncd group. the study starting point was set at 0 minute when the dex loading dose was initiated. the primary outcomes were the differences in hr and bp between the 2 groups during the study drug administration. secondary outcomes included the number of patients whose hr was < 50 beats per minute (bpm) after the dex loading dose infusion, and associated factors were evaluated. the incidence of hypotension in the postanesthesia care unit, postanesthesia care unit length of stay, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative urinary retention, time to first urination after spinal anesthesia, acute kidney injury, and postoperative hospital length of stay were evaluated. results: the hr was significantly higher at 14 minutes, and the mean bp was significantly lower at 10 minutes in the dex-ncd group than in the dex group. the number of patients with an hr < 50 bpm during surgery was significantly higher in the dex group than in the dex-ncd group at 12, 16, 24, 26, and 30 minutes. the dex group and a low initial hr were independently associated with the occurrence of an hr < 50 bpm after dex loading dose infusion. postoperative outcomes were not significantly different between the 2 groups. conclusions: simultaneous administration of ncd during the administration of a loading dose of dex prevented severe bradycardia. co-administration of ncd may be considered in patients with a low initial hr when severe bradycardia is expected during the dex loading dose infusion. ncd and dex may be safely infused simultaneously without affecting postoperative complications (see figure s1, supplemental digital content, http://links.lww.com/md/j241, graphical abstract).",AB_0095
"structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural networks, making them suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices. this study presents an efficient loss-aware automatic selection of structured pruning (laasp) criteria for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks. the majority of pruning methods employ a sequential process consisting of three stages, 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. the automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of training data. to mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of floating-point operations (flops). the optimal pruning rates for each layer in the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. experiments on the vggnet, resnet, and mobilenet models on the cifar-10 and imagenet benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. in particular, the resnet56 and resnet110 models on the cifar-10 dataset significantly improve the top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network flops by 52%. furthermore, pruning the resnet50 model on the imagenet dataset reduces flops by more than 42% with a negligible 0.33% drop in the top-5 accuracy. the source code of this study is publicly available on github: https://github.com/ghimiredhikura/laasp.",AB_0095
"since many future energy technologies, such as power generation with carbon-free hydrogen, biogas, and carbon capture, require sophisticated gas separation processes, many studies have investigated pressure swing adsorption (psa) processes due to their low cost and good energy efficiency. in the investigation of the psa processes, process simulations based on commercial software tools and in-house models have been conducted with different approaches. although these approaches have good simulation performances in particular cases, the use of software and in-house models is limited owing to certain drawbacks. the primary drawbacks include the high barriers to entry because of the need for excessive prior knowledge and non-compatibility with other software tools. thus, in this study, an open-source python-based adsorption process evaluation package (pyapep) was proposed for the simulation of psa process. the pyapep comprises three modules: isofit, simide, and simsep. the isofit module determines the optimal isotherm models for process simulations from the given adsorption equilibrium data. simide and simsep are the modules for ideal and actual psa process simulations, respectively, and they help users perform the process simulations easily using simple prior knowledge. this study also introduces the theories and methods in pyapep package, and it summarizes the example codes for each module. finally, the applicability of the proposed package is demonstrated through practical example problems. source code: https://github .com /sebygaa /pyapep or https://github .com /nahyeonan /pyapep documentation: https://sebygaa .github .io /pyapep or https://nahyeonan .github .io /pyapep & copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( .org /licenses /by-nc -nd /4 .0/).",AB_0095
"background organelle motility is essential for the correct cellular function of various eukaryotic cells. in plant cells, chloroplasts move towards the intracellular area irradiated by a weak light to maximise photosynthesis. to initiate this process, an unknown signal is transferred from the irradiated area to distant chloroplasts. quantification of this chloroplast movement has been performed using visual estimations that are analyst-dependent and labour-intensive. therefore, an objective and faster method is required. results in this study, we developed the cellssm package of r (https://github.com/hnishio/cellssm.git), which is a user-friendly tool for state-space modelling to statistically analyse the directional movement of cells or organelles. our method showed a high accuracy in estimating the start time of chloroplast movement in the liverwort marchantia polymorpha over a short period. the tool indicated that chloroplast movement accelerates during transport to the irradiated area and that signal transfer speed is uneven within a cell. we also developed a method to estimate the common dynamics among multiple chloroplasts in each cell, which clarified different characteristics among cells. conclusions we demonstrated that state-space modelling is a powerful method to understand organelle movement in eukaryotic cells. the cellssm package can be applied to various directional movements (both accumulation and avoidance) at cellular and subcellular levels to estimate the true transition of states behind the time-series data.",AB_0095
"lichen planus (lp) is an autoimmune disorder diagnosed based on physical symptoms and lab tests. examples of symptoms include flat bumps, and itchy and purplish skin while lab tests include a shave biopsy of the lesion. when the pathology report shows consistency with lp and is negative for potential triggers for an allergy test and hepatitis c, a dermatologist typically prescribes corticosteroid in the form of pills or injection into the lesion to treat the symptoms. to understand the molecular mechanism of the disease and thereby overcome issues associated with disease treatment, there is a need to identify potential effective drugs, drug targets, and therapeutic targets associated the lp. hence, we propose a novel computational framework based on new constrained optimization to support vector machines coupled with enrichment analysis. first, we downloaded three gene expression datasets (gse63741, gse193351, gse52130) pertaining to healthy and lp patients from the gene expression omnibus (geo) database. we then processed each dataset and entered it into our computational framework to select important genes. finally, we performed enrichment analysis of selected genes, reporting the following results. our methods outperformed baseline methods in terms of identifying disease and skin tissue. moreover, we report 5 drugs (including, dexamethasone, retinoic acid, and quercetin), 45 unique genes (including psmb8, krt31, krt16, krt19, krt17, col3a1, lce2d, lce2a), and 23 unique tfs (including nfkb1, stat1, stat3), reportedly related to lp pathogenesis, treatments, and therapeutic targets. our methods are publicly available in the genevarx web server at https://aibio.shinyapps.io/genevarx/.",AB_0095
"background: the identification of human epithelial type-2 mitotic cell patterns in the indirect immunofluores-cence images (iif hep-2) is a critical step for autoimmune diseases computer-aided diagnosis (cad) systems. recognition of hep-2 cells in the mitotic phase is clinically vital for validating the hep-2 samples and assisting in diagnosing specimens with mixed patterns. typically, mitotic cells are rarely observed in the hep-2 specimen images, resulting in a significant skewness of the available medical datasets towards the majority of interphase (non-mitotic) patterns. methods: in this paper, a deep learning framework is proposed based on a self-attention deep cross-residual network with an efficient generative adversarial network (gan). the proposed framework consists of two consecutive steps. first, the problem of imbalanced data of minority mitotic against the majority interphase cells is remedied using info-wgangp approach in combination with the conventional data augmentation methods. second, a downstream end-to-end deep learning att-dcrnet is developed to classify the mitotic and interphase cell patterns of the iif hep-2 medical images. a comprehensive experimental study is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework against other state-of-the-art methods over the public medical dataset of uq-snp_hep-2 task-3. results: the proposed framework demonstrates competitive classification results attaining a maximum perfor-mance of 84.10% f1-score, 84.70% matthew's correlation coefficient (mcc), and 99.0% balanced class accuracy (bca), which proves its applicability for automatically supporting an accurate diagnosis decision regarding the hep-2 mitotic and interphase cell patterns. the source code is available at this link: https://github.com/anaam-dl/attdcrnet_with_infowgangp.",AB_0095
"background: third-generation nanopore sequencers offer selective sequencing or read until that allows genomic reads to be analyzed in real time and abandoned halfway if not belonging to a genomic region of interest. this selective sequencing opens the door to important applications such as rapid and low-cost genetic tests. the latency in analyzing should be as low as possible for selective sequencing to be effective so that unnecessary reads can be rejected as early as possible. however, existing methods that employ a subsequence dynamic time warping (sdtw) algorithm for this problem are too computationally intensive that a massive workstation with dozens of cpu cores still struggles to keep up with the data rate of a mobile phone-sized minion sequencer. results: in this article, we present hardware accelerated read until (haru), a resource-efficient hardware-software codesign-based method that exploits a low-cost and portable heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chip platform with on-chip field-programmable gate arrays (fpga) to accelerate the sdtw-based read until algorithm. experimental results show that haru on a xilinx fpga embedded with a 4-core arm processor is around 2.5x faster than a highly optimized multithreaded software version (around 85x faster than the existing unoptimized multithreaded software) running on a sophisticated server with a 36-core intel xeon processor for a sars-cov-2 dataset. the energy consumption of haru is 2 orders of magnitudes lower than the same application executing on the 36-core server. conclusions: haru demonstrates that nanopore selective sequencing is possible on resource-constrained devices through rigorous hardware-software optimizations. the source code for the haru sdtw module is available as open source at https://github.com/beebdev/haru, and an example application that uses haru is at https://github.com/beebdev/sigfish-haru.",AB_0095
