"background: neoadjuvant immunotherapy with anti-pd-1 was proved promising in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). immune-related adverse events (iraes) have been preliminarily implicated their association with treatment efficacy. here we elucidated the early onset of iraes associated with better clinical outcomes in a prospective study (renaissance study). methods: we conducted the prospective study of nsclc patients treated by neoadjuvant toripalimab (240mg, every 3 weeks) plus double platinum-based chemotherapy from december 2020 to march 2022 at peking university cancer hospital. patients were enrolled if they have resectable iib-iiib nsclc without egfr/alk mutation. data were analyzed to explore the relationship between clinical outcome and iraes after neoadjuvant treatment. a multidisciplinary team including physicians, surgeons, and radiologists, confirmed the iraes according to the clinical manifestation. the relationship between iraes and pathological outcomes was analyzed. the renaissance study was approved by the peking university ethic board (2020yjz58) and registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ as nct04606303. results: fifty-five consecutive patients were enrolledwithamale-to-female ratio of 10:1, the median age was 62 years old (iqr: 45-76), of which 44 patients (80%) were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. forty-eight of 55 patients finally received thoracic surgery with a median preoperative waiting time of 67 days (iqr 39-113 days). pathological results demonstrated that 31 (64.6%) patients achieved major pathological response (mpr) and 24 (50.0%) achieved complete pathological response (pcr). among 48 patients who received r0 resection, immunotherapy-related thyroid dysfunction, rash/pruritus and enteritis occurred in 11 patients (22.9%), 7 patients (14.6%), and 1 patient (2.1%), respectively. six patients (54.5%) with thyroid dysfunction achieved mpr with 5 (45.5%) achieved pcr, and a median time to onset was 45 days (iqr 21-91 days). six patients (85.7%) with rash or pruritus achieved mpr and 5 patients (71.4%) achieved pcr, with median time to onset being 8 days (iqr 6-29 days). furthermore, iraes had no significant influence on operation time (170.6min vs 165.7 min, p=0.775), intraoperative blood loss (67.4ml vs 64.3ml, p=0.831) and preoperative waiting time (93 days vs 97 days, p=0.630) when comparing with patients without iraes (figure 1). conclusion: the immunotherapy-related rash is potentially associated with pathological outcomes in nsclc patients after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, suggesting easy-to-find iraes, such as rash, can be used as indicators to predict response to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy.",AB_0173
"methylation is a major dna epigenetic modification for regulating the biological processes without altering the dna sequence, and multiple types of dna methylations have been discovered, including 6ma, 5hmc, and 4mc. multiple computational approaches were developed to automatically identify the dna methylation residues using machine learning or deep learning algorithms. the machine learning (ml) based methods are difficult to be transferred to the other predicting tasks of the dna methylation sites using additional knowledge. deep learning (dl) may facilitate the transfer learning of knowledge from similar tasks, but they are often ineffective on small datasets. this study proposes an integrated feature representation framework epiteamdna based on the stra-tegies of transfer learning and ensemble learning, which is evaluated on multiple dna methylation types across 15 species. epiteamdna integrates convolutional neural network (cnn) and conventional machine learning methods, and shows improved performances than the existing dl-based methods on small datasets when no additional knowledge is available. the experimental data suggests that the epiteamdna models may be further improved via transfer learning based on additional knowledge. the evaluation experiments on the independent test datasets also suggest that the proposed epiteamdna framework outperforms the existing models in most prediction tasks of the 3 dna methylation types across 15 species. the source code, pre-trained global model, and the epiteamdna feature representation framework are freely available at http://www.healthinformat icslab.org/supp/.",AB_0173
"digital mammography is currently the most common imaging tool for breast cancer screening. although the benefits of using digital mammography for cancer screening outweigh the risks associated with the x-ray exposure, the radiation dose must be kept as low as possible while maintaining the diagnostic utility of the generated images, thus minimizing patient risks. many studies investigated the feasibility of dose reduction by restoring low-dose images using deep neural networks. in these cases, choosing the appropriate training database and loss function is crucial and impacts the quality of the results. in this work, we used a standard residual network (resnet) to restore low-dose digital mammography images and evaluated the performance of several loss functions. for training purposes, we extracted 256,000 image patches from a dataset of 400 images of retrospective clinical mammography exams, where dose reduction factors of 75% and 50% were simulated to generate low and standard-dose pairs. we validated the network in a real scenario by using a physical anthropomorphic breast phantom to acquire real low-dose and standard full-dose images in a commercially available mammography system, which were then processed through our trained model. we benchmarked our results against an analytical restoration model for low-dose digital mammography. objective assessment was performed through the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) and the mean normalized squared error (mnse), decomposed into residual noise and bias. statistical tests revealed that the use of the perceptual loss (pl4) resulted in statistically significant differences when compared to all other loss functions. additionally, images restored using the pl4 achieved the closest residual noise to the standard dose. on the other hand, perceptual loss pl3, structural similarity index (ssim) and one of the adversarial losses achieved the lowest bias for both dose reduction factors. the source code of our deep neural network is available at https://github.com/wang-axis/lddmdenoising.",AB_0173
"hand-eye calibration is a vital step in the laser profilometer integrated measurement system. however, the widely applied standard sphere calibration process requires extensive laborious human work and expertise. to standardize and streamline the hand-eye calibration process for industry 4.0, a semi-automatic calibration process was proposed, containing a calibration postures generation model and an intelligent circle detection method based on machine learning. with the proposed process, the measurement system can collect required data with minimal human participation and automatically processes them, which can significantly improve hand-eye calibration accuracy and efficiency. additionally, an exhaustive study of the influence of the number of postures on the calibration accuracy of the industrial robot and automated fibre placement (afp) machine demonstrates the proposed model's effectiveness. moreover, the current study's results can also be excellent tools for further hand-eye calibration research. our code and dataset are made publicly at: https://github.com/tang yipeng100/hand_eye_cali_circle_segmentation.",AB_0173
"rail-guided vehicle is a logistics management device widely used to perform various material handling operations instead of manual labor. in processing scenarios, the dimensions of the material transfer path of a rail-guided vehicle are typically very large, which makes the optimization of the material transfer path very difficult. the transdifferentiation behavior of lower organisms was introduced into the evolutionary algorithm, and a large-scale differential evolution algorithm based on the transdifferentiation strategy was proposed, for achieving high-efficiency processing. this strategy makes it possible for some individuals with poor fitness to reach maturity again and be selected for the next iteration after losing some information and returning to their juvenile stage, which helps maintain the diversity of the population. simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only achieves an average 25.68% higher output rate than the comparison algorithms on the test cases but also has an excellent and stable effect distribution level on the extended problem space, which shows that the superiority of the proposed algorithm is not affected by the processing parameters. this research is expected to provide technical guidance for the processing of key components in the ship and aviation manufacturing industries. the code with a 31-page manual is available on our project homepage https://github.com/mlnst-just/de-ts.",AB_0173

"an early form of eurypterids (chelicerata), archopterus anjiensis n. gen. n. sp., is described from the uppermost ordovician wenchang formation of anji county, zhejiang province, south china. it is the earliest record of eurypterids in china and likely the oldest representative of the adelophthalmidae. the species, represented by a single specimen, is diagnosed by a ventrally preserved prosoma with a parabolic carapace, hughmilleria-type prosomal appendages, a short vase-shaped metastoma, and a three-segmented type a (female) genital appendage. the specimen is preserved, together with diverse sponges, graptolites and occasional nautiloids, in a 10 m thick shale of marine deep-water setting. this finding extends the stratigraphic range of adelophthalmids from the previously recorded early silurian into the late ordovician (some 10 million years older) and supports an earlier cryptic phase of eurypterid evolution in gondwana.uuid: http://zoobank.org/a2d090e5-1a15-40b6-8e2a-dda45b01e94d",AB_0173
"ethnopharmacological relevance: traditional chinese medicine (tcm) has saved countless lives and maintained human health over its long history, especially in respiratory infectious diseases. the relationship between the intestinal flora and the respiratory system has been a popular research topic in recent years. according to the theory of the gut-lung axis in modern medicine and the idea that the lung stands in an interior-exterior relationship with the large intestine in tcm, gut microbiota dysbiosis is a contributing factor to respiratory infectious diseases, and there is potential means for manipulation of the gut microbiota in the treatment of lung diseases. emerging studies have indicated intestinal escherichia coli (e. coli) overgrowth in multiple respiratory infectious diseases, which could exacerbate respiratory infectious diseases by disrupting immune homeostasis, the gut barrier and metabolic balance. tcm is an effective microecological regulator, that can regulate the in-testinal flora including e. coli, and restore the balance of the immune system, gut barrier, and metabolism. aim of the review: this review discusses the changes and effects of intestinal e. coli in respiratory infection, as well as the role of tcm in the intestinal flora, e. coli and related immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism, thereby suggesting the possibility of tcm therapy regulating intestinal e. coli and related immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism to alleviate respiratory infectious diseases. we aimed to make a modest contribution to the research and development of new therapies for intestinal flora in respiratory infectious diseases and the full utilization of tcm resources. relevant information about the therapeutic potential of tcm to regulate in-testinal e. coli against diseases was collected from pubmed, china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki), and so on. the plants of the world online (https://wcsp.science.kew.org) and the plant list (www.theplantlist.org) databases were used to provide the scientific names and species of plants. results: intestinal e. coli is a very important bacterium in respiratory infectious diseases that affects the respi-ratory system through immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism. many tcms can inhibit the abundance of e. coli and regulate related immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism to promote lung health. conclusion: tcm targeting intestinal e. coli and related immune, gut barrier, and metabolic dysfunction could be a potential therapy to promote the treatment and prognosis of respiratory infectious diseases.",AB_0173
"stereo image super-resolution aims to exploit the complementary information between image pairs and generate images with high resolution and rich details. however, existing methods explicitly calculate the similarity between image patches or pixels to build correspondence between different views. these hard -matching methods leave deep semantic information between image pairs unexplored. in this paper, a stereo image super-resolution method with interactive memory learning is designed to take advantage of the complementary information of different views in an implicit way. specifically, we propose an interactive memory learning strategy to implicitly capture the semantic similarity between different views and design a feature dual-aggregation module for feature refinement. extensive experiments on different datasets achieve state-of-the-art results, demonstrating that our method effectively boosts the quantitative and qualitative results of stereoscopic image pairs. code can be found at: https://github.com/zhuxiangyuan1/imlnet.",AB_0173
"self-attention modules have shown dominance in image captioning. however, current self-attention modules insufficiently consider spatial correlations between objects in an image and easily suffer from distribution shifts. in this work, we aim to improve self-attention modules in two ways to solve the above problems. we first propose a spatial-enhanced attention (sea) module, which incorporates dual spatial encodings to enhance geometric correlations between visual instances. we further introduce a gated-normalized attention (gna) module to fix the distributions inside self-attention module. gna module also smooths gradients and reduces misleading information. to prove our designs, we apply sea module and gna module to the standard transformer to construct a novel dual-spatial normalized transformer (dsnt), which captures a more accurate spatial representations and improves performance of image captioning. extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposal. compared to non-pretrained state-of-the-art methods, quantitative results on the mscoco dataset show that our dsnt achieves competitive performance on both the offline and online test sets, i.e., 134.8% cider score on the karpathy split and 134.0% cider score on the official split. our source code is available at https://github.com/tbi805/dsnt.",AB_0173
