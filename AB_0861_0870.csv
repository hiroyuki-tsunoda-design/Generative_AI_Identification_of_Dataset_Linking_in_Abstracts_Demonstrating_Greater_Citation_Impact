"designing a transcranial electrical stimulation (tes) strategy requires considering multiple objectives, such as intensity in the target area, focality, stimulation depth, and avoidance zone. these objectives are often mutually exclusive. in this paper, we propose a general framework, called multi-objective optimization via evolutionary algorithm (movea), which solves the non-convex optimization problem in designing tes strategies without a predefined direction. movea enables simultaneous optimization of multiple targets through pareto optimization, generating a pareto front after a single run without manual weight adjustment and allowing easy expansion to more targets. this pareto front consists of optimal solutions that meet various requirements while respecting trade-off relationships between conflicting objectives such as intensity and focality. movea is versatile and suitable for both transcranial alternating current stimulation (tacs) and transcranial temporal interference stimulation (ttis) based on high definition (hd) and two-pair systems. we comprehensively compared tacs and ttis in terms of intensity, focality, and steerability for targets at different depths. our findings reveal that ttis enhances focality by reducing activated volume outside the target by 60%. hd-ttis and hd-tdcs can achieve equivalent maximum intensities, surpassing those of two-pair ttis, such as 0.51 v/m under hd-tacs/hd-ttis and 0.42 v/m under two-pair ttis for the motor area as a target. analysis of variance in eight subjects highlights individual differences in both optimal stimulation policies and outcomes for tacs and ttis, emphasizing the need for personalized stimulation protocols. these findings provide guidance for designing appropriate stimulation strategies for tacs and ttis. movea facilitates the optimization of tes based on specific objectives and constraints, advancing ttis and tacs-based neuromodulation in understanding the causal relationship between brain regions and cognitive functions and treating diseases. the code for movea is available at https://github.com/ncclabsustech/movea.",AB_0087
"most deepfake detection methods focus on detecting spatial and/or spatio-temporal changes in facial attributes and are centered around the binary classification task of detecting whether a video is real or fake. this is because available benchmark datasets contain mostly visual-only modifications present in the entirety of the video. however, a sophisticated deepfake may include small segments of audio or audio-visual manipulations that can completely change the meaning of the video content. to addresses this gap, we propose and benchmark a new dataset, localized audio visual deepfake (lav-df), consisting of strategic content-driven audio, visual and audio-visual manipulations. the proposed baseline method, boundary aware temporal forgery detection (ba-tfd), is a 3d convolutional neural network-based architecture which effectively captures multimodal manipulations. we further improve (i.e. ba-tfd+) the baseline method by replacing the backbone with a multiscale vision transformer and guide the training process with contrastive, frame classification, boundary matching and multimodal boundary matching loss functions. the quantitative analysis demonstrates the superiority of ba-tfd+ on temporal forgery localization and deepfake detection tasks using several benchmark datasets including our newly proposed dataset. the dataset, models and code are available at https://github.com/controlnet/lav-df.",AB_0087
"neurotensin (nt) is a linear disordered peptide that activates two different class a gpcrs, neurotensin receptor 1 (nts1) and nts2. resolved structures of the complex of the c-terminal fragment of nt, nt8-13, with nts1 shows the peptide takes a well-defined structure in the bound state. however, the mechanisms underlying nt recognition of nts1, and the conformational transition of nt upon binding nts1 is an open question that if answered may aid discovery of highly selective drugs and reveal potential secondary binding sites on the surface of the receptor. herein we investigated the interactions guiding nt to the orthosteric binding pocket of nts1 by combining nmr experiments with kinetic analysis of the binding pathway using stopped-flow fluorescence and mutagenesis on both nt and nts1. we show the presence of transient structures in the middle part of nt that kinetically regulate the binding of nt to nts1. moreover, our results indicate that the binding pathway of nt onto nts1 is mediated via electrostatic interactions between the n-terminal region of nt with the extracellular loop 2 of nts1. these interactions induce backbone conformational changes in neurotensin similar to the bound-state neurotensin, suggesting that the n-terminal region of nt and these interactions should be considered for development of selective drugs against nts1.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0087
"this paper proposes a meta heuristic optimization algorithm, called crayfish optimization algorithm (coa), which simulates crayfish's summer resort behavior, competition behavior and foraging behavior. the three behaviors are divided into three different stages to balance the exploration and exploitation of algorithm. the three stages are summer resort stage, competition stage and foraging stage. the summer resort stage represents the exploration stage of the coa. the competition stage and foraging stage represent the exploitation stage of the coa. exploration and exploitation of coa are regulated by temperature. when the temperature is too high, crayfish will enter the cave for summer vacation or compete for the same cave. when the temperature is appropriate, crayfish have different foraging behaviors according to the size of food. among them, the amount of food eaten by crayfish is related to food intake. through temperature regulate exploration and exploitation process in coa, the coa has higher randomness and global optimization effect. to verify the optimization effect of coa, in the experimental part, 23 standard benchmark functions and cec2014 benchmark functions are used to test, and 9 algorithms are selected for comparative experiments. the experimental results show that coa can balance the exploration and exploitation, and achieve good optimization effect. finally, the coa is tested in five engineering problems, and finally achieves better results. the source code website for coa is https://github.com/rao12138/coa-s-code.",AB_0087
"unsupervised cross-modal hashing has attracted considerable attention to support large-scale cross-modal retrieval. although promising progresses have been made so far, existing methods still suffer from limited capability on excavating and preserving the intrinsic multi-modal semantics. in this paper, we propose a correlation-identity reconstruction hashing (cirh) method to alleviate this challenging problem. we develop a new unsupervised deep cross-modal hash learning framework to model and preserve the heterogeneous multi-modal correlation semantics into both hash codes and functions, and simultaneously, we involve both the hash codes and functions with the descriptive identity semantics. specifically, we construct a multi-modal collaborated graph to model the heterogeneous multi-modal correlations, and jointly perform the intra-modal and cross-modal semantic aggregation on homogeneous and heterogeneous graph networks to generate a multi-modal complementary representation with correlation reconstruction. furthermore, an identity semantic reconstruction process is designed to involve the generated representation with identity semantics by reconstructing the input modality representations. finally, we propose a correlation-identity consistent hash function learning strategy to transfer the modelled multi-modal semantics into the neural networks of modality-specific deep hash functions. experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method on both retrieval accuracy and efficiency. we provide our source codes and experimental datasets at https://github.com/xizewu/cirh",AB_0087
"despite the remarkable results achieved by deep convolutional neural networks (cnns) in single image super-resolution (sisr), their computational cost increase exponentially as cnn models get deeper and wider. consequently, depthwise separable convolutions (dsconvs) have emerged as the fundamental building basis for various contemporary lightweight network architectures. however, depthwise convolution is sub-optimal for restoring missing high-frequency details. in this paper, we commence with the vanilla depthwise convolution and progressively develop it to alleviate the above problem. specifically, we introduce an effective method, kernel attention injection, to integrate intra-kernel correlation into the depthwise convolution layer by incorporating the learned kernel attention into the depthwise kernel. we find that the determinant is capable of capturing the correlation between diagonal elements of the depthwise kernel by summing the products of the diagonals. therefore, we utilize the determinant as the kernel pooling method. furthermore, we propose to remove the non-linear activation function behind the depthwise convolution (i.e., linear depthwise convolution) to preserve informative features for reconstructing faithful high-resolution (hr) images. built on this recipe, we introduce kernel-attentive linear depthwise separable convolutions (kdsconvs), which exhibits promising super-resolution performance. our experimental results underline the potential of depthwise convolution in super-resolution tasks by demonstrating that the proposed kdsconvs significantly outperforms dsconvs in terms of both quantitative measurements and visual quality. the code will be released at https://github.com/awesomehwang/kaldn.",AB_0087
"as a simple yet effective model compression method, knowledge distillation (or kd) is used to learn a small lightweight student network by transferring valuable knowledge from a pretrained cumbersome teacher network. however, existing kd methods usually consider the feature knowledge either in different layers or individual samples, failing to explore more detailed information in different channels from the perspective of sample relationships. meanwhile, the negative influences contained in the teacher knowledge are also not well investigated, especially, when using the response-based knowledge. to address the above-mentioned issues, we devise a novel kd approach entitled channel correlation-based selective kd (or ccskd). specifically, to distill rich knowledge from feature representations, we not only consider the feature knowledge from different channels for individual samples but also take into account the relational knowledge based on per-channel features for different samples. furthermore, to further distill positive response-based knowledge, a selective strategy is developed, i.e., selective kd, to progressively correct the negative influences from the teacher knowledge during the distillation process. we perform extensive experiments on three image classification data sets, cifar-100, stanford cars, and tiny-imagenet, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ccskd, which outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods with a clear margin. our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/gjplab/ ccskd.",AB_0087
"egocentric early action prediction, which aims to recognize the on-going action in the video captured in the first-person view as early as possible before the action is fully executed, is a new yet challenging task due to the limited partial video input. pioneer studies focused on solving this task with lstms as the backbone and simply compiling the observed video segment and unobserved video segment into a single vector, which hence suffer from two key limitations: lack the non-sequential relation modeling with the video snippet sequence and the correlation modeling between the observed and unobserved video segment. to address these two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal transformer-based dual action prediction (mtrace) model for the task of egocentric early action prediction, which consists of two key modules: the early (observed) segment action prediction module and the future (unobserved) segment action prediction module. both modules take transformer encoders as the backbone for encoding all the potential relations among the input video snippets, and involve several single-modal and multi-modal classifiers for comprehensive supervision. different from previous work, each of the two modules outputs two multi-modal feature vectors: one for encoding the current input video segment, and the other one for predicting the missing video segment. for optimization, we design a two-stage training scheme, including the mutual enhancement stage and end-to-end aggregation stage. the former stage alternatively optimizes the two action prediction modules, where the correlation between the observed and unobserved video segment is modeled with a consistency regularizer, while the latter seamlessly aggregates the two modules to fully utilize the capacity of the two modules. extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed model. we have released the codes and the corresponding parameters to benefit other researchers at https://trace729.wixsite.com/trace.",AB_0087
"in this article, we utilize the advantages of an event camera to tackle the visual place recognition (vpr) problem. the event camera's high measurement rate, low latency, and high dynamic range make it well-suited to overcome the limitations of conventional vision sensors. however, to apply the existing convolutional neural network (cnn)-based algorithms such as netvlad, the asynchronous event stream should be converted to a synchronous image frame, which causes a loss in temporal information. to address this problem, this article proposes a method that employs the asynchronous characteristic of spiking neural networks (snns) to leverage the temporal nature of event streams. the event stream is converted to event images and tensors in our preprocessing module. the snn-based reconstruction networks, which are converted from cnns, reconstruct edge images from event tensors regardless of external environment changes. vpr is conducted by matching features of the database and those from netvlad, which we used as a feature extraction network in this study. to evaluate the performance of vpr by comparing the previous methods for ddd17 and the brisbane-event-vpr dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the matching accuracy of the proposed method is better than previous methods, especially for datasets with adverse weather conditions. we also verify that the performance and energy efficiency are improved with snns over cnns. our code is available for download on https://github.com/airlabkhu/evreconnet.",AB_0087
"pantoea stewartii, a plant pathogen, is primarily transmitted through contaminated seeds and insect vectors, with the corn flea beetle (chaetocnema pulicaria) being the primary carrier. p. stewartii is a bacterium belonging to the order enterobacterales and can lead to crop diseases that have a significant economic impact worldwide. due to its high potential for spread, p. stewartii is classified as a quarantine organism in numerous countries. despite its impact on agriculture, the limited genome sequences of p. stewartii hamper understanding of its pathogenicity and host specificity, and the development of effective control strategies. in this study, a p. stewartii strain (c10109_jinnung) was discovered in the faecal matter of the critically endangered western ground parrot/kyloring (pezoporus flaviventris) in australia, which to our knowledge is the first reported p. stewartii genome from a bird source. whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomic analysis of strain c10109_jinnung, obtained from a captive psittacine, provides new insights into the genetic diversity and potential transmission route for the spread of p. stewartii beyond insects and plants, where p. stewartii is typically studied. our findings provide new insights into the potential transmission route for spread of p. stewartii and expand the known transmission agents beyond insects and plants. expanding the catalogue of p. stewartii genomes is fundamental to improving understanding of the pathogenicity, evolution and dissemination, and to develop effective control strategies to reduce the substantial economic losses associated with p. stewartii in various crops and the potential impact of endangered animal species.data summarythe study sequences are available in the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) under bioproject accession number prjna967810. the raw illumina sequence read data generated in this study have been deposited at the ncbi sequence read archive [sra (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)] under accession number srr24455997. the draft assembly has been deposited in genbank under accession number jascym000000000. the software used to analyse raw sequence reads for polymorphism discovery and whole-genome sequencing -based phylogenetic reconstruction are available as described in the methods. the authors confirm that all supporting data protocols have been provided in the article or supplementary data files.",AB_0087
