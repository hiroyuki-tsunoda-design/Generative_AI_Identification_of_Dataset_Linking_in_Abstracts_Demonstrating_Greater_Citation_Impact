"antiviral drugs are important for the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) response, as vaccines and antibodies may have reduced efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) variants. antiviral drugs that have been made available for use, albeit with questionable efficacy, include remdesivir (veklury (r)), nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (paxlovidtm), and molnupiravir (lagevrio (r)). to expand the options available for covid-19 and prepare for future pandemics, there is a need to investigate new uses for existing drugs and design novel compounds. to support these efforts, we have created a comprehensive library of 750 molecules that have been sourced from in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies. it is publicly available at our dedicated website (https://epimedlab.org/crl/). the epimed coronabank chemical collection consists of compounds that have been divided into 10 main classes based on antiviral properties, as well as the potential to be used for the management, prevention, or treatment of covid-19 related complications. a detailed description of each compound is provided, along with the molecular formula, canonical smiles, and u.s. food and drug administration approval status. the chemical structures have been obtained and are available for download. moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of the ligands have been characterised. to demonstrate an application of the epimed coronabank chemical collection, molecular docking was used to evaluate the binding characteristics of ligands against sars-cov-2 nonstructural and accessory proteins. overall, our database can be used to aid the drug repositioning process, and for gaining further insight into the molecular mechanisms of action of potential compounds of interest.",AB_0090
"graph representation learning methods have gained great popularity in tackling various analytics tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. however, most of graph representation learning methods merely consider the local information around the nodes. in addition, information about the global relative position information of each node is not fully taken into account. recently, position-aware graph neural networks have been proposed to capture positions of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes and embed this position information into the feature representation, which aims to distinguish nodes which are locally structurally similar. this network aggregates position information from the randomly sampled anchor set nodes to the given target node. with such randomness, the sampled nodes lack particularity, and not all of them are significant enough in the graph to be used as position reference points. to address these issues, we propose a position and structure-aware graph learning framework (psgl). the proposed psgl extracts local topology information of nodes through the structure representation module, obtains anchor set nodes through graph pooling and further calculates global position information of the nodes to each anchor set node. the attention mechanism is used to weigh the obtained local topology and the global position information adaptively. our proposed psgl is capable of learning structural and positional information adaptively and encoding more informative characteristics in real-world networks. our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed psgl outperforms the state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods. our code is available at https://github.com/leaf-ygq/psgl.",AB_0090
"the folding and stability of transmembrane proteins (tmps) are governed by the insertion of secondary structural elements into the cell membrane followed by their assembly. understanding the important features that dictate the stability of tmps is important for elucidating their functions. in this work, we related sequence and structurebased parameters with free energy (& udelta;g0) of & alpha;-helical membrane proteins. our results showed that the free energy transfer of hydrophobic peptides, relative contact order, total interaction energy, number of hydrogen bonds and lipid accessibility of transmembrane regions are important for stability. further, we have developed multipleregression models to predict the stability of & alpha;-helical membrane proteins using these features and our method can predict the stability with a correlation and mean absolute error (mae) of 0.89 and 1.21 kcal/mol, respectively, on jack-knife test. the method was validated with a blind test set of three recently reported experimental & udelta;g0, which could predict the stability within an average mae of 0.51 kcal/mol. further, we developed a webserver for predicting the stability and it is freely available at (https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/tmhs/). the importance of selected parameters and limitations are discussed.",AB_0090
"phosphoproteomicsis nowadays the method of choice to comprehensivelyidentify and quantify thousands of phosphorylated peptides and theirassociated proteins with the goal of interrogating changes in signaltransduction pathways and other cellular processes. one of the mostpopular software suites to analyze phosphoproteomic data sets is maxquant,which converts mass spectrometric raw data into quantitative informationon phosphopeptides and proteins. however, despite the increased utilizationof phosphoproteomics in biomedical research, simple and user-friendlytools supporting downstream statistical analysis and interpretationof these highly complex outputs are still lacking. we have thereforedeveloped phospho-analyst, which similar to its sibling lfq-analyst isan easy-to-use, interactive web application specifically designedto reproducibly perform differential expression analyses with oneclick and to visualize phosphoproteomic results in a meaningfuland practical manner. furthermore, if quantitative total proteomicinformation is available for the same samples, phospho-analyst automaticallynormalizes all phosphoproteomic results to underlying protein abundancelevels, thereby ensuring that only genuine changes in phosphorylationevents are considered. as such, phospho-analyst can not only be usedby experienced proteomic veterans but also by researchers withoutany prior knowledge in (phospho)proteomics, statistics, or bioinformatics.phospho-analyst, including a detailed manual, is freely availableat https://analyst-suites.org/apps/phospho-analyst/.",AB_0090
"marine diazotrophs convert dinitrogen (n-2) gas into bioavailable nitrogen (n), supporting life in the global ocean. in 2012, the first version of the global oceanic diazotroph database (version 1) was published. here, we present an updated version of the database (version 2), significantly increasing the number of in situ diazotrophic measurements from 13 565 to 55 286. data points for n-2 fixation rates, diazotrophic cell abundance, and nifh gene copy abundance have increased by 184 %, 86 %, and 809 %, respectively. version 2 includes two new data sheets for the nifh gene copy abundance of non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs and cell-specific n2 fixation rates. the measurements of n-2 fixation rates approximately follow a log-normal distribution in both version 1 and version 2. however, version 2 considerably extends both the left and right tails of the distribution. consequently, when estimating global oceanic n-2 fixation rates using the geometric means of different ocean basins, version 1 and version 2 yield similar rates (43-57 versus 45-63 tgnyr (-1); ranges based on one geometric standard error). in contrast, when using arithmetic means, version 2 suggests a significantly higher rate of 223 +/- 30 tgnyr (-1) (mean +/- standard error; same hereafter) compared to version 1 (74 +/- 7 tgnyr (-1)). specifically, substantial rate increases are estimated for the south pacific ocean (88 +/- 23 versus 20 +/- 2 tgnyr 1), primarily driven by measurements in the southwestern subtropics, and for the north atlantic ocean (40 +/- 9 versus 10 +/- 2 tgnyr (-1)). moreover, version 2 estimates the n-2 fixation rate in the indian ocean to be 35 +/- 14 tgnyr (-1), which could not be estimated using version 1 due to limited data availability. furthermore, a comparison of n-2 fixation rates obtained through different measurement methods at the same months, locations, and depths reveals that the conventional n-15(2) bubble method yields lower rates in 69% cases compared to the new n-15(2) dissolution method. this updated version of the database can facilitate future studies in marine ecology and biogeochemistry. the database is stored at the figshare repository (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21677687; shao et al., 2022).",AB_0090
"the application of visual tracking to the performance analysis of sports players in dynamic competitions is vital for effective coaching. in doubles matches, coordinated positioning is crucial for maintaining control of the court and minimizing opponents' scoring opportunities. the analysis of such teamwork plays a vital role in understanding the dynamics of the game. however, previous studies have primarily focused on analyzing and assessing singles players without considering occlusion in broadcast videos. these studies have relied on discrete representations, which involve the analysis and representation of specific actions (e.g., strokes) or events that occur during the game while overlooking the meaningful spatial distribution. in thiswork, we present the first annotated drone dataset from top and back views in badminton doubles and propose a framework to estimate the control area probability map, which can be used to evaluate teamwork performance. we present an efficient framework of deep neural networks that enables the calculation of full probability surfaces. this framework utilizes the embedding of a gaussian mixture map of players' positions and employs graph convolution on their poses. in the experiment, we verify our approach by comparing various baselines and discovering the correlations between the score and control area. additionally, we propose a practical application for assessing optimal positioning to provide instructions during a game. our approach offers both visual and quantitative evaluations of players' movements, thereby providing valuable insights into doubles teamwork. the dataset and related project code is available at https:// github.com/ning- d/ drone_bd_controlarea",AB_0090
"introduction: seminal emotion socialization theories classify parents according to two patterns of parent emotion socialization processes: 'emotion coaching' (i.e., parents validate and teach children about emotions) versus 'emotion dismissing' parenting (i.e., parents minimize and dismiss their children's emotions). however, empirical evidence supporting this binary distinction of parents remains limited. our objective was to investigate whether parents can be differentiated by distinct patterns in their (1) beliefs about children's emotions, (2) emotion regulation, and (3) emotion-related parenting practices. method: participants were parents of children aged 4-10 years from the child and parent emotion study (n=869) (https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/10/e038124). parents completed self-reported measures of emotion socialization processes via an online survey, which took 20-30 min to complete. data included in the current study were collected may-august 2019. we conducted a latent profile analysis of parents' emotion socialization (13 indicators). to assess reliability of the profiles, we examined stability of the profiles across (1) parents of children in early versus middle childhood, and (2) fathers versus mothers, via measurement invariance testing. further, to assess for construct validity of the profiles, we examined concurrent associations between six criterion constructs and parents' emotion socialization profiles. results: a three-profile model emerged characterizing parents by: (1) emotion coaching; (2) emotion dismissing; (3) emotion disengaged. there was strong support for construct validity and reliability. discussion: our study provides empirical support for distinct differentiated classifications of emotion coaching and emotion dismissing parenting, aligned with emotion socialization theories. we further extend on extant theory and suggest a third 'emotion disengaged' classification, describing parents with moderate levels of emotion dismissing parenting and low levels of emotion coaching parenting. it should be noted that the profiles were derived with self-report data, therefore, data may have been biased by contextual factors. furthermore, the study sample consisted of western families from affluent backgrounds. the field should focus efforts on conducting person-centered studies with more diverse samples in future.",AB_0090
"objective: we explore the framing of literature-based discovery (lbd) as link prediction and graph embedding learning, with alzheimer's disease (ad) as our focus disease context. the key link prediction setting of prediction window length is specifically examined in the context of a time-sliced evaluation methodology. methods: we propose a four-stage approach to explore literature-based discovery for alzheimer's disease, creating and analyzing a knowledge graph tailored to the ad context, and predicting and evaluating new knowledge based on time-sliced link prediction. the first stage is to collect an ad-specific corpus. the second stage involves constructing an ad knowledge graph with identified ad-specific concepts and relations from the corpus. in the third stage, 20 pairs of training and testing datasets are constructed with the time-slicing methodology. finally, we infer new knowledge with graph embedding-based link prediction methods. we compare different link prediction methods in this context. the impact of limiting prediction evaluation of lbd models in the context of short-term and longer-term knowledge evolution for alzheimer's disease is assessed. results: we constructed an ad corpus of over 16 k papers published in 1977-2021, and automatically annotated it with concepts and relations covering 11 ad-specific semantic entity types. the knowledge graph of alzheimer's disease derived from this resource consisted of & sim;11 k nodes and & sim;394 k edges, among which 34% were genotype-phenotype relationships, 57% were genotype-genotype relationships, and 9% were phenotype -phenotype relationships. a structural deep network embedding (sdne) model consistently showed the best performance in terms of returning the most confident set of link predictions as time progresses over 20 years. a huge improvement in model performance was observed when changing the link prediction evaluation setting to consider a more distant future, reflecting the time required for knowledge accumulation. conclusion: neural network graph-embedding link prediction methods show promise for the literature-based discovery context, although the prediction setting is extremely challenging, with graph densities of less than 1%. varying prediction window length on the time-sliced evaluation methodology leads to hugely different results and interpretations of lbd studies. our approach can be generalized to enable knowledge discovery for other diseases. availability: code, ad ontology, and data are available at https://github.com/read-biomed/readbiomed-lbd.",AB_0090
"greedy routing efficiently achieves routing solutions for vehicular networks due to its simplicity and reliability. however, the existing greedy routing algorithms have mainly considered simple routing metrics only, e.g., distance based on the local view of an individual vehicle. this consideration is insufficient for analysing dynamic and complicated vehicular communication scenarios which inevitably degrades the overall routing performance. software-defined vehicular network (sdvn) and graph convolutional network (gcn) can overcome these limitations. thus, this paper presents a novel gcn-based greedy routing algorithm (nggra) in the hybrid sdvn. the sdvn control plane trains the gcn decision model based on the globally collected data. vehicles with transmission requirements can adopt this model for inferring and making the routing decisions. the proposed node-importance-based graph convolutional network (nigcn) model analyses multiple correlated metrics to accurately evaluate the dynamic vehicular network is available at: https://github.com/a824899245/nigcn. meanwhile, the sdvn architecture offers a global view for model training and routing computation. extensive simulation results demonstrate that nigcn outperforms popular gcn models in training efficiency and accuracy. in addition, nggra can improve the packet delivery ratio and substantially reduce delay compared with its counterparts.",AB_0090
"lakes and reservoirs are ubiquitous across global landscapes, functioning as the largest repository of liquid surface freshwater, hotspots of carbon cycling, and sentinels of climate change. although typically considered lentic (hydrologically stationary) environments, lakes are an integral part of global drainage networks. through perennial and intermittent hydrological connections, lakes often interact with each other, and these connections actively affect water mass, quality, and energy balances in both lacustrine and fluvial systems. deciphering how global lakes are hydrologically interconnected (or the so-called lake drainage topology) is not only important for lake change attribution but also increasingly critical for discharge, sediment, and carbon modeling. despite the proliferation of river hydrography data, lakes remain poorly represented in routing models, partially because there has been no global-scale hydrography dataset tailored to lake drainage basins and networks. here, we introduce the global lake drainage topology and catchment database (lake-topocat), which reveals detailed lake hydrography information with careful consideration of possible multifurcation. lake-topocat contains the outlet(s) and catchment(s) of each lake; the interconnecting reaches among lakes; and a wide suite of attributes depicting lake drainage topology such as upstream and downstream relationship, drainage distance between lakes, and a priori drainage type and connectivity with river networks. using the hydrolakes v1.0 (messager et al., 2016) global lake mask, lake-topocat identifies similar to 1.46 million outlets for similar to 1.43 million lakes larger than 10 ha and delineates 77.5 x 10(6) km(2) of lake catchments covering 57% of the earth's landmass except antarctica. the global lakes are interconnected by similar to 3 million reaches, derived from merit hydro v1.0.1 (yamazaki et al., 2019), stretching a total distance of similar to 10 x 10(6) km, of which similar to 80% are shorter than 10 km. with such unprecedented lake hydrography details, lake-topocat contributes towards a globally coupled lake-river routing model. it may also facilitate a variety of limnological applications such as attributing water quality from lake scale to basin scale, tracing inter-lake fish migration due to changing climate, monitoring fluvial-lacustrine connectivity, and improving estimates of terrestrial carbon fluxes. lake-topocat is freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7916729 (sikder et al., 2023).",AB_0090
