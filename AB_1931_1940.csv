"backgroundin the absence of effective measures to predict steroid responsiveness, patients with nonhereditary steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (srns) have a significantly increased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. in view of the poor outcomes of srns, it is urgent to identify the steroid responsiveness of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (ins) early. methodsto build a prediction model for srns, we collected 91 subjects; 57 of them had steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, and the others had srns. for each subject, 87 clinical variables were measured. in general, only a small part of these variables is informative to srns. thus, we proposed a new variable selection framework including a penalized regression approach (named mlr+tlp) to select variables having a linear effect on the srns and a nonparametric screening method (mac) to select variables having a nonlinear marginal (joint) effect on the srns. thereafter, considering the correlation between selected clinical variables, we used a stepwise method to build our final model for predicting srns. in addition, a statistical testing procedure is proposed to test the overfitting of the proposed model. resultstwenty-six clinical variables were selected to be informative to srns, and an svm model was built to predict srns with a leave-one-out cross-validation (loo-cv) accuracy of 95.2% (overfitting p value<0.005). to make the model more useful, we incorporate prior medical information into the model and consider the correlation between selected variables. then, a reduced svm model including only eight clinical variables (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urine occult blood, percentage of neutrophils, immunoglobulin a, cholesterol, vinculin autoantibody, aspartate aminotransferase, and prolonged prothrombin time) was built to have a loo-cv accuracy of 92.8% (overfitting p value<0.005). the validation cohort showed that the reduced model obtained an accuracy of 94.0% (overfitting p value<0.005), with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 96.7%. notably, vinculin autoantibody is the only podocyte autoantibody included in this model. it is linearly related to steroid responsiveness. finally, our model is freely available as a user-friendly web tool at https://datalinkx.shinyapps.io/srns/. conclusionthe srns prediction model constructed in this study comprehensively and objectively evaluates the internal conditions and disease status of ins patients and will provide scientific guidance for selecting treatment methods for children with nonhereditary srns.",AB_0194
"identifying disease-related biomarkers from high-dimensional dna methylation data helps in reducing early screening costs and inferring pathogenesis mechanisms. good discovery results have been achieved through spatial correlation methods of methylation sites, group-based regularization, and network constraints. however, these methods still have some key limitations as they cannot exclude isolated differential sites and only consider adjacent site ordering. therefore, we propose a group-shrinkage feature selection algorithm to encourage the selection of clustered sites and discourage the selection of isolated differential sites. specifically, a network -guided group-shrinkage strategy is developed to penalize weakly-correlated isolated methylation sites through a network structure constraint. the spatial network is constructed based on spatial correlation information of dna methylation sites, where this information accounts for the uneven site distribution. the experimental simulations and applications demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the advanced regularization methods, especially in rejecting isolated methylation sites; hence this study provides an efficient and clinical -valuable method for biomarker candidate discovery in dna methylation data. additionally, the proposed method exhibits enhanced reliability due to introducing biological prior knowledge into a regularization -based feature selection framework and could promote more research in the integration between biological prior knowledge and classical feature selection methods, thus facilitating their clinical application. our source codes will be released at https://github.com/sjtubme-qianlab/group-shrinkage-spatial-network once this manuscript is accepted for publication.",AB_0194
"video anomaly detection, which is weakly supervised by video-level annotations, is a frequent yet challenging task in computer vision owing to its unexpectedness, equivocality, rarity, irregularity, and diversity. although previous seminal works successfully leveraged graph convolutions to assist in the detection of anomalies, they failed to subsequently explore the potential of this approach. in this study, we developed a spatial-temporal graph attention network (stga), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first effort to combine graph convolutions with a multi-head graph attention mechanism for video anomaly detection. specifically, a spatial correlation graph and temporal dependence graph were devised to learn distinguishable representations with the complementation of graph attention techniques. furthermore, stga was incorporated within the multiple instance learning (mil) pipeline, and optimized via top-k mil ranking loss after a sparse continuous sampling strategy was put into effect. we conducted experiments using four multi-scale datasets to validate the efficacy of our model. quantitatively, our method performs equivalently to the current best result on shanghaitech with a frame-level area under the curve (auc) of 97.21%, obtains the second-best result on ucsd-ped2 with a frame-level auc of 97.4%, gains a frame-level auc of 80.28% on ucf-crime, and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on tad with a frame-level auc of 91.42%. additionally, our false alarm rate results outperform those obtained in previous studies on shanghaitech and ucf-crime, which demonstrates the robustness of our approach. all relevant code has been made available at https://github.com/hychen96/stga-vad. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0194
"backgroundthe leucine rich repeat containing 3b (lrrc3b) gene is a tumor suppressor gene involved in the anti-tumor immune microenvironment. expression of lrrc3b and dna methylation at the lrrc3b promoter region may serve as a useful marker to predict response to anti-pd-1 therapy. however, no studies have yet systematically explored the protective role of lrrc3b methylation in tumor progression and immunity. methodsexpression of lrrc3b of 33 cancer types in the cancer genome atlas (tcga) was downloaded from ucsc xena (http://xena.ucsc.edu/). and, we evaluated the differential expression of lrrc3b according to tumor stage, overall survival, and characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. the immunotherapeutic cohorts included imvigor21, gse119144, and gse72308 which were obtained from the gene expression omnibus database. we conducted pearson correlation analysis of lrrc3b and tumor microenvironment (tme) in pan-cancer. also, six immune cell types (b cells, cd8+ t cells, cd4+ t cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) and tumor purity were analyzed using the tumor immune estimation resource (timer1.0) (tumor immune estimation resource (timer2.0). and, a silencing score model base on lrrc3b promoter methylation to predict overall survival (os) by multivariate cox regression analysis was constructed. finally, the model was applied to predict anti-pd-1 therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) and breast cancer (brca). resultslrrc3b expression associated with less tumor invasion, less severe tumor stage, and decreased metastasis. the inactivation of lrrc3b promoted the enrichment of immuneosuppressive cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (cafs), m2 subtype of tumor-associated macrophages (m2-tams), m1 subtype of tumor-associated macrophages (m1-tams), and regulatory t (treg) cells. a high silencing score was significantly associated with immune inhibition, low expression of lrrc3b, poor patient survival, and activation of cancer-related pathways. conclusionour comprehensive analysis demonstrated the potential role of lrrc3b in the anti-tumor microenvironment, clinicopathological features of cancer, and disease prognosis. it suggested that lrrc3b methylation could be used as a powerful biomarker to predict immunotherapy responses in nsclc and brca.",AB_0194
"hypopharyngeal cancer (hpc) is a rare disease. therefore, it is a challenge to automatically segment hpc tumors and metastatic lymph nodes (hpc risk areas) from medical images with the small-scale dataset. combining low-level details and high-level semantics from feature maps in different scales can improve the accuracy of seg-mentation. herein, we propose a multi-modality transfer learning network with hybrid bilateral encoder (twist-net) for hypopharyngeal cancer segmentation. specifically, we propose a bilateral transition (bt) block and a bilateral gather (bg) block to twist (fuse) high-level semantic feature maps and low-level detailed feature maps. we design a block with multi-receptive field extraction capabilities, m block, to capture multi-scale in-formation. to avoid overfitting caused by the small scale of the dataset, we propose a transfer learning method that can transfer priors experience from large computer vision datasets to multi-modality medical imaging datasets. compared with other methods, our method outperforms other methods on hpc dataset, achieving the highest dice of 82.98%. our method is also superior to other methods on two public medical segmentation datasets, i.e., the chase_db1 dataset and brats2018 dataset. on these two datasets, the dice of our method is 79.83% and 84.87%, respectively. the code is available at: https://github.com/zhongqiu1245/twistnet.",AB_0194
"antioxidant peptides can protect against free radical-mediated diseases, especially food-derived antioxidant peptides are considered as potential competitors among synthetic antioxidants due to their safety, high activity and abundant sources. however, wet experimental methods can not meet the need for effectively screening and clearly elucidating the structure-activity relationship of antioxidant peptides. therefore, it is particularly important to build a reliable prediction platform for antioxidant peptides. in this work, we developed a platform, anoxpp, for prediction of antioxidant peptides using the bidirectional long short-term memory (bilstm) neural network. the sequence characteristics of peptides were converted into feature codes based on amino acid de-scriptors (aads). our results showed that the feature conversion ability of the combined-aads optimized by the forward feature selection method was more accurate than that of the single-aads. especially, the model trained by the optimal descriptor sdpz27 significantly outperformed the existing predictor on two independent test sets (accuracy = 0.967 and 0.819, respectively). the sdpz27-based anoxpp learned four key structure-activity features of antioxidant peptides, with the following importance as steric properties > hydrophobic properties > electronic properties > hydrogen bond contributions. anoxpp is a valuable tool for screening and design of peptide drugs, and the web-server is accessible at http://www.cqudfbp.net/anoxpp/index.jsp.",AB_0194
"deep multi-view clustering (mvc) is to mine and employ the complex relationships among views to learn the compact data clusters with deep neural networks in an unsupervised manner. the more recent deep contrastive learning (cl) methods have shown promising performance in mvc by learning cluster-oriented deep feature representations, which is realized by contrasting the positive and negative sample pairs. however, most existing deep contrastive mvc methods only focus on the one-side contrastive learning, such as feature-level or cluster-level contrast, failing to integrating the two sides together or bringing in more important aspects of contrast. additionally, most of them work in a separate two-stage manner, i.e., first feature learning and then data clustering, failing to mutually benefit each other. to fix the above challenges, in this paper we propose a novel joint contrastive triple-learning framework to learn multi-view discriminative feature representation for deep clustering, which is threefold, i.e., feature-level alignment-oriented and commonality-oriented cl, and cluster-level consistency-oriented cl. the former two submodules aim to contrast the encoded feature representations of data samples in different feature levels, while the last contrasts the data samples in the cluster-level representations. benefiting from the triple contrast, the more discriminative representations of views can be obtained. meanwhile, a view weight learning module is designed to learn and exploit the quantitative complementary information across the learned discriminative features of each view. thus, the contrastive triple-learning module, the view weight learning module and the data clustering module with these fused features are jointly performed, so that these modules are mutually beneficial. the extensive experiments on several challenging multi-view datasets show the superiority of the proposed method over many state-of-the-art methods, especially the large improvement of 15.5% and 8.1% on caltech-4v and ccv in terms of accuracy. due to the promising performance on visual datasets, the proposed method can be applied into many practical visual applications such as visual recognition and analysis. the source code of the proposed method is provided at https://github.com/shizhehu/joint-contrastive-triple-learning.",AB_0194
"soil moisture (sm) is a key variable of the regional hydrological cycle and has important applications for water resource and agricultural drought management. various global soil moisture products have been mostly retrieved from microwave remote sensing data. however, currently there is rarely spatially explicit and time-continuous soil moisture information with a high resolution at the national scale. in this study, we generated a 1 km soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize in china (chinacropsm1 km) over 1993-2018 through a random forest (rf) algorithm based on numerous in situ daily observations of soil moisture. we independently used in situ observations (181 327 samples) from the agricultural meteorological stations (amss) across china for training (164 202 samples) and others for testing (17 125 samples). an irrigation module was first developed according to crop type (i.e., wheat, maize), soil depth (0-10, 10-20 cm) and phenology. we produced four daily datasets separately by crop type and soil depth, and their accuracies were all satisfactory (wheat r 0.93, ubrmse 0.033 m(3) m(-3); maize r 0.93, ubrmse 0.035 m(3) m(-3)). the spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy of chinacropsm1 km were significantly better than those of global soil moisture products (e.g., r increased by 116 %, ubrmse decreased by 64 %), including the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (rsssm) and the european space agency (esa) climate change initiative (cci) sm. the approach developed in our study could be applied to other regions and crops in the world, and our improved datasets are very valuable for many studies and field management, such as agricultural drought monitoring and crop yield forecasting. the data are published in zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6834530 (wheat(0-10)) (cheng et al., 2022a), https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6822591 (wheat(10-20)) (cheng et al., 2022b), https://doi/org/10.5281/zenodo.6822581 (maize(10)) (cheng et al., 2022c) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6820166 (maize(10-20)) (cheng et al., 2022d).",AB_0194
"this study explored the role of transient receptor potential channel melastatin 2 (trpm2)-mediated activation of nod-, lrr-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (nlrp3) inflammasome in osteo-genesis during healing of tooth extraction sockets. tooth extraction socket tissue samples were collected from patients with or without periodontitis. in a trpm2 knockout mouse model of socket healing, mice with or without periodontitis and their wild-type littermates were used for comparing the socket healing phenotypes. micro-computed tomography imaging, three-dimensional reconstruction of the sockets, and hematoxylin and eosin staining for histopathologic analysis were performed. immu-nofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis were used for evaluation of protein expression; the mrna levels were evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr. osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation potential of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bmmscs) was evaluated. calcium deposition was evaluated using alizarin red s staining. nlrp3 and casp1 were up-regulated in tooth sockets of periodontitis patients. nlrp3 knockdown promoted the osteogenic dif-ferentiation of maxillary bmmscs under inflammatory conditions. trpm2 was up-regulated in the tooth extraction socket tissue of periodontitis. inhibiting trpm2 expression mitigated the nlrp3 inflam-masome and its deleterious effect on osteogenesis. activation of the trpm2 ion channel regulated osteogenesis of bmmscs under inflammatory conditions via ca2 thorn influx, the mitochondrial dynamics, and pyroptosis. targeting the trpm2/ca2 thorn /nlrp3 axis could be beneficial in the healing process of the tooth extraction sockets of patients with periodontitis.(am j pathol 2023, 193: 213-232; https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2022.10.009)",AB_0194
"in general stereo matching methods, there are mainly two kinds of weaknesses: the interior of large objects with unclear texture; object boundaries and small objects. one of the reasons for the first case is the underuse of inter -feature and intra-feature contexts, leading to the lack of discriminability of feature representations. and the sec-ond case could be caused result from the loss of fine-grained structural information in the features. in this work, we present a novel stereo matching network to enhance the feature representations, which contains two prom-inent components: pyramid context enhancement module and cross-modal enhancement module. pyramid con-text enhancement module first constructs multi-scale pyramid features to promote global representation, and then exploits the inter-feature and intra-feature contextual information to improve the discriminability of fea-tures. cross-modal enhancement module proactively degrades features of rgb image and disparity map to im-plicitly extract structures, and fuses both structures to recover the modal consistent structural information of features. moreover, we design a disparity weight loss function which can calculates the adaptive weight accord-ing to prediction error to balance the loss response. extensive experiments demonstrate that our method boosts the performance, and achieves better results on five challenging datasets than other typical methods. code is available at: https://github.com/csl1994/fenet.
