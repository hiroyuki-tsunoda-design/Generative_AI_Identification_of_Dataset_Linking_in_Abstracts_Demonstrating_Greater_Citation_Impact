"alternative splicing (as) is a fundamental process that governs almost all aspects of cellular functions, and dysregulation in this process has been implicated in tumor initiation, progression and treatment resistance. with accumulating studies of carcinogenic mis-splicing in cancers, there is an urgent demand to integrate cancer-associated splicing changes to better understand their internal crosstalks and functional consequences from a global view. however, a resource of key functional as events in human cancers is still lacking. to fill the gap, we developed ascancer atlas (https://ngdc. cncb.ac.cn/ascancer), a comprehensive knowledgebase of aberrant splicing in human cancers. compared to extant databases, ascancer atlas features a high-confidence collection of 2006 cancerassociated splicing events experimentally proved to promote tumorigenesis, a systematic splicing regulatory network, and a suit of multi-scale online analysis tools. for each event, we manually curated the functional axis including upstream splicing regulators, splicing event annotations, downstream oncogenic effects, and possible therapeutic strategies. ascancer atlas also houses about 2 million computationally putative splicing events. additionally, a user-friendly web interface was built to enable users to easily browse, search, visualize, analyze, and download all splicing events. overall, ascancer atlas provides a unique resource to study the func- tional roles of splicing dysregulation in human cancers.",AB_0031
"it is a challenge to efficiently integrate and present the tremendous amounts of single-cell data generated from multiple tissues of various species. here, we create a new database named speed for single-cell pan-species atlas in the light of ecology and evolution for development and diseases (freely accessible at http://8.142.154.29 or http://speedatlas.net ). speed is an online platform with 4 data modules, 7 function modules and 2 display modules. the 'pan' module is applied for the interactive analysis of single cell sequencing datasets from 127 species, and the 'evo', 'devo', and 'diz' modules provide comprehensive analysis of single-cell atlases on 18 evolution datasets, 28 development datasets, and 85 disease datasets. the 'c2c', 'g2g' and 's2s' modules explore intercellular communications, genetic regulatory networks, and cross-species molecular evolution. the 'ssearch', 'shmarker, 'sup, and 'sdown' modules allow users to retrieve specific data information, obtain common marker genes for cell types, freely upload, and download single-cell datasets, respectively. two display modules ('home' and 'help') offer easier access to the speed database with informative statistics and detailed guidelines. all in all, speed is an integrated platform for single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) and single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scwgs) datasets to assist the deep-mining and understanding of heterogeneity among cells, tissues, and species at multi-levels, angles, and orientations, as well as provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of biological development and pathogenesis.",AB_0031
"ferroptosis is a mode of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation. it is closely linked to the pathophysiological processes in many diseases. since our publication of the first ferroptosis database in 2020 (ferrdb v1), many new findings have been published. to keep up with the rapid progress in ferroptosis research and to provide timely and high-quality data, here we present the successor, ferrdb v2. it contains 1001 ferroptosis regulators and 143 ferroptosis-disease associations manually curated from 3288 articles. specifically, there are 621 gene regulators, of which 264 are drivers, 238 are suppressors, 9 are markers, and 110 are unclassified genes; and there are 380 substance regulators, with 201 inducers and 179 inhibitors. compared to ferrdb v1, curated articles increase by >300%, ferroptosis regulators increase by 175%, and ferroptosis-disease associations increase by 50.5%. circular rna and pseudogene are novel regulators in ferrdb v2, and the percentage of non-coding rna increases from 7.3% to 13.6%. external gene-related data were integrated, enabling thought-provoking and gene-oriented analysis in ferrdb v2. in conclusion, ferrdb v2 will help to acquire deeper insights into ferroptosis. ferrdb v2 is freely accessible at http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/.",AB_0031
"commitment to specific cell lineages is critical for mammalian embryonic development. lineage determination, differentiation, maintenance, and organogenesis result in diverse life forms composed of multiple cell types. to understand the formation and maintenance of living individuals, including human beings, a comprehensive database that integrates multi-omic information underlying lineage differentiation across multiple species is urgently needed. here, we construct lineage landscape, a database that compiles, analyzes and visualizes transcriptomic and epigenomic information related to lineage development in a collection of species. this landscape draws together datasets that capture the ongoing changes in cell lineages from classic model organisms to human beings throughout embryonic, fetal, adult, and aged stages, providing comprehensive, open-access information that is useful to researchers of a broad spectrum of life science disciplines. lineage landscape contains single-cell gene expression and bulk transcriptomic, dna methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility profiles. using this database, users can explore genes of interest that exhibit dynamic expression patterns at the transcriptional or epigenetic levels at different stages of lineage development. lineage landscape currently includes over 6.6 million cells, 15 million differentially expressed genes and 36 million data entries across 10 species and 34 organs. lineage landscape is free to access, browse, search, and download at http://data.iscr.ac.cn/lineage/#/home.",AB_0031
"doric was first launched in 2007 as a database of replication origins (orics) in bacterial genomes and has since been constantly updated to integrate the latest research progress in this field. the database was subsequently extended to include the orics in archaeal genomes as well as those in plasmids. this latest release, doric 12.0, includes the orics in both draft and complete prokaryotic genomes. at the same time, the number of orics in the database has also increased significantly and currently contains over 200 000 bacterial entries distributed in more than 40 phyla. among them, a large number are from bacteria in new phyla whose orics were not explored before. additionally, new oric features and improvements have been introduced, especially in the visualization and analysis of orics. currently, doric is considered as an important database in the fields of bioinformatics, microbial genomics, and even synthetic biology, providing a valuable resource as well as a comprehensive platform for the research on orics. doric 12.0 can be accessed at https://tubic.org/doric/ and http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/.",AB_0031
"rna modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by a series of writers, erasers and readers (wers). abnormal changes of wers will disrupt the rna modification homeostasis of their target genes, leading to the dysregulation of rna metabolisms such as rna stability and translation, and consequently to diseases such as cancer. a public repository hosting the regulatory relationships between wers and their target genes will help in understanding the roles of rna modifications in various physiological and pathological conditions. previously, we developed a database named 'm6a2target' to host targets of wers in m6a, one of the most prevalent rna modifications in eukaryotic cells. to host all rna modification (rm)-related wer-target associations, we hereby present an updated database, named 'rm2target' (http://rm2target.canceromics.org/) . in this update, rm2target encompasses 1 619 653 wer-target associations for nine rna modifications in human and mouse, including m6a, m6arn, m5c, m5u, ml a, m7g, pseudouridine, 2'-o-me and a-to-i. extensive annotations of target genes are available in rm2target, including but not limited to basic gene information, rna modifications, rna-rna/rna-protein interactions and related diseases. altogether, we expect that rm2target will facilitate further downstream functional and mechanistic studies in the field of rna modification research.",AB_0031
"single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) as the most important type of genetic variation are widely used in describing population characteristics and play vital roles in animal genetics and breeding. large amounts of population genetic variation resources and tools have been developed in human, which provided solid support for human genetic studies. however, compared with human, the development of animal genetic variation databases was relatively slow, which limits the genetic researches in these animals. to fill this gap, we systematically identified similar to 499 million high-quality snps from 4784 samples of 20 types of animals. on that basis, we annotated the functions of snps, constructed high-density reference panels and calculated genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (ld) matrixes. we further developed animal-snpatlas, a user-friendly database (http://gong_lab.hzau.edu. cn/animal_snpatlas/) which includes high-quality snp datasets and several support tools for multiple animals. in animal-snpatlas, users can search the functional annotation of snps, perform online genotype imputation, explore and visualize ld information, browse variant information using the genome browser and download snp datasets for each species. with the massive snp datasets and useful tools, animal-snpatlas will be an important fundamental resource for the animal genomics, genetics and breeding community.",AB_0031
"proteolysis targeting chimeras (protacs), which harness the ubiquitin-proteasome system to selectively induce targeted protein degradation, represent an emerging therapeutic technology with the potential to modulate traditional undruggable targets. over the past few years, this technology has moved from academia to industry and more than 10 protacs have been advanced into clinical trials. however, designing potent protacs with desirable drug-like properties still remains a great challenge. here, we report an updated online database, protac-db 2.0, which is a repository of structural and experimental data about protacs. in this 2nd release, we expanded the number of protacs to 3270, which corresponds to a 96% expansion over the first version. meanwhile, the numbers of warheads (small molecules targeting the proteins of interest), linkers, and e3 ligands (small molecules recruiting e3 ligases) have increased to over 360, 1500 and 80, respectively. in addition, given the importance and the limited number of the crystal target-protac-e3 ternary complex structures, we provide the predicted ternary complex structures for protacs with good degradation capability using our protac-model method. to further facilitate the analysis of protac data, a new filtering strategy based on the e3 ligases is also added. protac-db 2.0 is available online at http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/protacdb/.",AB_0031
