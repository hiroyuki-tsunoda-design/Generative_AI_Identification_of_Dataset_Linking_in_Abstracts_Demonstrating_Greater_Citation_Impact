"in the lower mekong river basin floodplains, rice cultivation is highly crucial for regional and global food se-curity. however, prolonged flooding can pose damage to rice cultivation and other socio-economic aspects. yet, there is no rapid operational inundation forecasting system that can help decision-makers proactively mitigate flood damages. here, we integrated the so-called forecasting inundation extents using rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis (fier) framework with an altimetry-based operational mekong river level fore-casting system and built an operational web application, fier-mekong, (https://fier-mekong.streamlit.app/) that generates daily skillful forecasted inundation extents (>70% of critical success index) and depths in about 3 and 30 s, respectively, with up to 18-day lead times. one of its applications, predicting flood-induced rice economic losses, is also presented. had fier-mekong being adopted, we estimated that the rice damages, up to 87 and 53 million us dollars during the 2020 and 2021 harvest time, respectively, could have been avoided.",AB_0115
"the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has seen multiple anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies being generated globally. it is difficult, however, to assemble a useful compendium of these biological properties if they are derived from experimental measurements performed at different sites under different experimental conditions. the coronavirus immunotherapeutic consortium (covic) circumvents these issues by experimentally testing blinded antibodies side by side for several functional activities. to collect these data in a consistent fashion and make it publicly available, we established the covic database (covic-db, https://covicdb.lji.org/). this database enables systematic analysis and interpretation of this large-scale dataset by providing a comprehensive view of various features such as affinity, neutralization, in vivo protection and effector functions for each antibody. interactive graphs enable direct comparisons of antibodies based on select functional properties. we demonstrate how the covic-db can be utilized to examine relationships among antibody features, thereby guiding the design of therapeutic antibody cocktails.",AB_0115
"the protein rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (raf) is a kinase downstream of the membrane protein ras in the cellular signal transduction system. in the structure of raf, the n-and c-terminus domains are connected with a flexible linker. the open/close dynamics and dimerization of raf are thought to reg-ulate its activity, although the details of these conformations are unknown, especially in live cells. in this work, we used alternating laser excitation to measure cytosolic craf in live hela cells and obtained single-molecule fo spacing diaeresis rster resonance energy transfer (smfret) distributions of the structural states. we compared the results for wild-type (wt)-craf before and after epidermal growth factor (egf) stimula-tion, with mutations of the 14-3-3 binding sites and cysteine-rich domain, and an n-terminus truncation. the smfret distributions of full-length crafs were analyzed by global fitting with three beta distribu-tions. our results suggested that a 14-3-3 dimer bound to two sites on a single craf molecule and induced the formation of the autoinhibitory closed conformation. there were two closed conformations, which the majority of wt-craf adopted. these two conformations showed different responsiveness to egf stimulation.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0115
"although transformer can be powerful for modeling visual relations and describing complicated patterns, it could still perform unsatisfactorily for video-based facial expression recognition, since the expression movements in a video can be too small to reflect meaningful spatial-temporal relations. to this end, we propose to decompose the modeling of expression movements of a video into the modeling of a series of expression snippets, each of which contains a few frames, and then boost the transformer's ability for intra-snippet and inter-snippet visual modeling, respectively, obtaining the expression snippet trans-former (est). for intra-snippet modeling, we devise an attention-augmented snippet feature extractor to enhance the encoding of subtle facial movements of each snippet. for inter-snippet modeling, we in-troduce a shuffled snippet order prediction head and a corresponding loss to improve the modeling of subtle motion changes across subsequent snippets. the est obtains state-of-the-art performance, demon-strating its superiority to other cnn-based methods. our code and the trained model are available at https://github.com/dreammr/est (c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0115
"t cells expressing either alpha-beta or gamma-delta t cell receptors (tcr) are critical sentinels of the adaptive immune system, with receptor diversity being essential for protective immunity against a broad array of pathogens and agents. programs available to profile tcr clonotypic signatures can be limiting for users with no coding expertise. current analytical pipelines can be inefficient due to manual processing steps, open to data entry errors and have multiple analytical tools with unique inputs that require coding expertise. here we present a bespoke webtool designed for users irrespective of coding expertise, coined 'tcr_explore', enabling analysis either derived via sanger sequencing or next generation sequencing (ngs) platforms. further, tcr_explore incorporates automated quality control steps for sanger sequencing. the creation of flexible and publication ready figures are enabled for different sequencing platforms following universal conversion to the tcr_explore file format. tcr_explore will enhance a user's capacity to undertake in-depth tcr repertoire analysis of both new and pre-existing datasets for identification of t cell clonotypes associated with health and disease. the web application is located at https://tcr-explore.erc.monash.edu for users to interactively explore tcr repertoire datasets.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0115
"recent convolutional detectors learn strong semantic features by generating and combining multi-scale features via feature interpolation. however, simple interpolation incurs often noisy and blurred features. to resolve this, we propose a novel adversarially-trained interpolator which can substitute for the tra-ditional interpolation effortlessly. in specific, we design afi-gan consisting of an af interpolator and a feature patch discriminator. in addition, we present a progressive adversarial learning and afi-gan losses to generate multi-scale features for downstream detection tasks. however, we can also finetune the pro-posed afi-gan with the recent multi-scale detectors without the adversarial learning once a pre-trained af interpolator is provided. we prove the effectiveness and flexibility of our af interpolator, and achieve the better box and mask aps by 2.2% and 1.6% on average compared to using other interpolation. more -over, we achieve an impressive detection score of 57.3% map on the mscoco dataset. code is available at https://github.com/inhavl-shlee/afi- gan .(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0115
"high-order methods are being recognized as powerful tools for handling scale-resolving simulations over complex geometry. however, several obstacles still block their complete applications to practical engineering problems: a compromise between accuracy and efficiency on mixed-curved meshes, inherent vulnerability to numerical oscillations, and lack of open-source high-performance solvers for researchers. to address these issues, we present deneb, an open-source high-order accurate numerical solver that enables high-performance scale-resolving simulations on pde-based flow systems. deneb uses the physical domain-based modal discontinuous galerkin (dg) method; thus, it can provide an arbitrary high -order accurate solution on mixed-curved meshes and has the potential for handling polyhedral meshes as well. the direct reconstruction method (drm) efficiently executes the numerical integration of dg volume and surface integrals without accuracy loss on non-affine elements where mapping functions are high-degree. the resulting drm-dg method eliminates the severe cost of a quadrature-based approach on mixed-curved meshes. deneb offers explicit and implicit runge-kutta methods as well to achieve high-order accuracy in time. in addition, krylov subspace methods and preconditioners are available for high-performance linear system solving in parallel. deneb possesses a strong capability to resolve multi -physical shocks without numerical instabilities with the aid of multi-dimensional limiting and artificial viscosity methods. in particular, the hierarchical multi-dimensional limiting process enables efficient computations of supersonic flows without time-step restriction. the current release of deneb covers the simulations of hypersonic equilibrium and magneto-hydrodynamic flows as well as compressible navier- stokes equations, but it has the potential to solve any pde-based multi-physical flow systems. several benchmark problems are presented to highlight deneb's capability to perform scale-resolving and multi -physical flow simulations. a scalability test is also presented to verify the scaling characteristics of deneb for high-performance computing.program summary program title: denebcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /723n5r797n .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /hojunyoukr /deneblicensing provisions: bsd-3-clauseprogramming language: c++17nature of problem: the physical domain-based modal dg method can achieve the expected order of accuracy with the optimal number of polynomial bases even on non-affine elements. however, the dg method becomes significantly expensive on high-order curved elements when using quadrature rules, blocking its applicability to practical engineering problems. the numerical integration should be much more efficient without compromising accuracy. in addition, the less diffusive nature of high-order methods makes them susceptible to producing spurious numerical oscillations near flow discontinuities, potentially leading to numerical instabilities. thus, an accurate and robust shock-capturing method is essential to simulate multi-physical flows under compressible regimes. finally, the solver needs high scalability to perform large-scale computations in parallel.solution method: drm is applied to the dg volume and surface integrals to perform efficient numerical integration on non-affine elements without accuracy loss. the resulting method, drm-dg, provides arbitrary high-order accurate solutions to various pde-based flow problems on mixed-curved meshes. the solution is also high-order accurate in time due to high-order explicit and implicit runge-kutta methods implemented. the external library enables high-performance linear system solving with various preconditioners in parallel. both multi-dimensional limiting and artificial viscosity methods suppress unwanted subcell oscillations across physical discontinuities. in particular, the limiting methods simulate complex supersonic flows efficiently without time-step restriction. the solver is highly scalable on parallel computing with the aid of non-blocking communications and latency hiding.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( .org /licenses /by-nc -nd /4 .0/).",AB_0115
"environmental factors affect the growth of microorganisms and therefore alter the composition of microbiota. correlative analysis of the relationship between metagenomic composition and the environmental gradient can help elucidate key environmental factors and establishment principles for microbial communities. however, a reasonable method to quantitatively compare whole metagenomic data and identify the primary environmental factors for the establishment of microbiota has not been reported so far. in this study, we developed a method to compare whole proteomes deduced from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data, and quantitatively display their phylogenetic relationships as metagenomic trees. we called this method metagenomic phylogeny by average sequence similarity (mpass). we also compared one of the metagenomic trees with dendrograms of environmental factors using a comparison tool for phylogenetic trees. the mpass method correctly constructed metagenomic trees of simulated metagenomes and soil and water samples. the topology of the metagenomic tree of samples from the kirishima hot springs area in japan was highly similarity to that of the dendrograms based on previously reported environmental factors for this area. the topology of the metagenomic tree also reflected the dynamics of microbiota at the taxonomic and functional levels. our results strongly suggest that mpass can successfully classify metagenomic shotgun sequencing data based on the similarity of whole protein-coding sequences, and will be useful for the identification of principal environmental factors for the establishment of microbial communities. custom perl script for the mpass pipeline is available at https://github.com/s0sat/mpass.",AB_0115
"multi-object tracking (mot) is among crucial applications in modern advanced driver assistance systems (adas) and autonomous driving (ad) systems. the global nearest neighbor (gnn) filter, as the earliest random vector-based bayesian tracking framework, has been adopted in most of state-of-the-arts trackers in the automotive industry. the development of random finite set (rfs) theory facilitates a mathematically rigorous treatment of the mot problem, and different variants of rfs-based bayesian filters have then been proposed. however, their effectiveness in the real adas and ad application is still an open problem. in this paper, it is demonstrated that the latest rfs-based bayesian tracking frame-work could be superior to typical random vector-based bayesian tracking framework via a systematic comparative study of both traditional random vector-based bayesian filters with rule-based heuristic track maintenance and rfs-based bayesian filters on the nuscenes validation dataset. an rfs-based tracker, namely poisson multi-bernoulli filter using the global nearest neighbor (gnn-pmb), is proposed to lidar-based mot tasks. this gnn-pmb tracker is simple to use, and it achieves competitive results on the nuscenes dataset. specifically, the proposed gnn-pmb tracker outperforms most state-of-the-art lidar-only trackers and lidar and camera fusion-based trackers, ranking the 3rd among all lidar-only trackers on nuscenes 3d tracking challenge leader board (https://bit.ly/3bqj2cp) at the time of submission.",AB_0115
"video person retrieval aims at matching video clips of the same person across non-overlapping camera views, where video sequences contain more comprehensive information, e.g., temporal cues. how to extract useful temporal cues is the key to the success of a video person retrieval system. gait, as a unique biometric modality indicating the way people walk, contains informative temporal information. to date, it is not clear how to fully utilize gait to boost the performance of video person retrieval. in this paper, to validate whether gait could help retrieve person in videos, we build a two-stream architecture, named appearance-gait network (agnet), to jointly learn the appearance features and gait features from rgb video clips and silhouette video clips. we further explore how to fully utilize gait features to enhance the video feature representation. specifically, we propose an appearance-gait attention module (aga) to fuse a discriminative feature representation for the person retrieval task. furthermore, to eliminate the requirement of silhouette video clips during inference, we propose a simple yet effective appearance-gait distillation module (agd) which transfers the gait knowledge to appearance stream. as such, we are able to perform the enhanced video person retrieval without silhouette video clips, which makes the inference more flexible and practical. to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to successfully introduce such appearance-gait knowledge distillation design for video person retrieval. we verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods on two large-scale challenging benchmarks of mars and dukemtmc-videoreid. extensive experiments demonstrate superior or comparable performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods while being much simpler. source code is publicly available at https://github.com/yangyangkiki/gait-assisted-video-reid.",AB_0115
