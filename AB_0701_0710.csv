"we propose a simulation framework for generating instance-dependent noisy labels via a pseudo-labeling paradigm. we show that the distribution of the synthetic noisy labels generated with our framework is closer to human labels compared to independent and class-conditional random flipping. equipped with controllable label noise, we study the negative impact of noisy labels across a few practical settings to understand when label noise is more problematic. we also benchmark several existing algorithms for learning with noisy labels and compare their behavior on our synthetic datasets and on the datasets with independent random label noise. additionally, with the availability of annotator information from our simulation framework, we propose a new technique, label quality model (lqm), that leverages annotator features to predict and correct against noisy labels. we show that by adding lqm as a label correction step before applying existing noisy label techniques, we can further improve the models' performance. the synthetic datasets that we generated in this work are released at https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/noisy_label.",AB_0071
"real causal processes may contain cycles, evolve over time or differ between populations. however, many graphical models cannot accommodate these conditions. we propose to model causation using a mixture of directed cyclic graphs (dags); each sample follows a joint distribution that factorizes according to a dag, but the dag may differ between samples due to multiple independent factors. we then introduce an algorithm called causal inference over mixtures that uses longitudinal data to infer a graph summarizing the causal relations generated from a mixture of dags even when cycles, non-stationarity, latent variables or selection bias exist. experiments demonstrate improved performance in inferring ancestral relations as compared to prior approaches. r code is available at https://github.com/ericstrobl/cim.",AB_0071
"patients with acute coronary syndromes caused by plaque erosion might be managed conservatively without stenting. currently, the diagnosis of plaque erosion requires an invasive imaging procedure. we sought to develop a deep learning (dl) model that enables an accurate diagnosis of plaque erosion using coronary computed tomography angiography (cta). a total of 532 cta scans from 395 patients were used to develop a dl model: 426 cta scans from 316 patients for training and internal validation, and 106 separate scans from 79 patients for validation. momentum distillation-enhanced composite transformer attention (md-cta), a novel dl model that can effectively process the entire set of cta scans to diagnose plaque erosion, was developed. the novel dl model, compared to the convolution neural network, showed significantly improved auc (0.899 [0.841-0.957] vs. 0.724 [0.622-0.826]), sensitivity (87.1 [70.2-96.4] vs. 71.0 [52.0-85.8]), and specificity (85.3 [75.3-92.4] vs. 68.0 [56.2-78.3]), respectively, for the patient-level prediction. similar results were obtained at the slice-level prediction auc (0.897 [0.890-0.904] vs. 0.757 [0.744-0.770]), sensitivity (82.2 [79.8-84.3] vs. 68.9 [66.2-71.6]), and specificity (80.1 [79.1-81.0] vs. 67.3 [66.3-68.4]), respectively. this newly developed dl model enables an accurate ct diagnosis of plaque erosion, which might enable cardiologists to provide tailored therapy without invasive procedures.clinical trial registration:http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, nct04523194.",AB_0071
"motivation cell fate is commonly studied by profiling the gene expression of single cells to infer developmental trajectories based on expression similarity, rna velocity, or statistical mechanical properties. however, current approaches do not recover microenvironmental signals from the cellular niche that drive a differentiation trajectory.results we resolve this with environment-aware trajectory inference (entrain), a computational method that integrates trajectory inference methods with ligand-receptor pair gene regulatory networks to identify extracellular signals and evaluate their relative contribution towards a differentiation trajectory. the output from entrain can be superimposed on spatial data to co-localize cells and molecules in space and time to map cell fate potentials to cell-cell interactions. we validate and benchmark our approach on single-cell bone marrow and spatially resolved embryonic neurogenesis datasets to identify known and novel environmental drivers of cellular differentiation.availability and implementation entrain is available as a public package at https://github.com/theimagelab/entrain and can be used on both single-cell and spatially resolved datasets.",AB_0071
"introduction transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) has shown positive but inconsistent results in stroke rehabilitation. this could be attributed to inter-individual variations in brain characteristics and stroke lesions, which limit the use of a single tdcs protocol for all post-stroke patients. optimizing the electrode location in tdcs for each individual using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to generate three-dimensional computer models and calculate the electric field (e-field) induced by tdcs at a specific target point in the primary motor cortex may help reduce these inconsistencies. in stroke rehabilitation, locating the optimal position that generates a high e-field in a target area can influence motor recovery. therefore, this study was designed to determine the effect of personalized tdcs electrode positions on hand-knob activation in post-stroke patients. method this is a crossover study with a sample size of 50 participants, who will be randomly assigned to one of six groups and will receive one session of either optimized-active, conventional-active, or sham tdcs, with 24 h between sessions. the tdcs parameters will be 1 ma (5 x 5 cm electrodes) for 20 min. the motor-evoked potential (mep) will be recorded before and after each session over the target area (motor cortex hand-knob) and the mep hotspot. the mep amplitude at the target location will be the primary outcome. discussion we hypothesize that the optimized-active tdcs session would show a greater increase in mep amplitude over the target area in patients with subacute and chronic stroke than conventional and sham tdcs sessions. clinical trial registration: https://cris.nih.go.kr, identifier kct0007536.discussion we hypothesize that the optimized-active tdcs session would show a greater increase in mep amplitude over the target area in patients with subacute and chronic stroke than conventional and sham tdcs sessions. clinical trial registration: https://cris.nih.go.kr, identifier kct0007536.",AB_0071
"background: recognizing the early signs of cancer risk is vital for informing prevention, early detection, and survival. methods: to investigate whether changes in circulating metabolites characterize the early stages of colorectal cancer (crc) development, we examined the associations between a genetic risk score (grs) associated with crc liability (72 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and 231 circulating metabolites measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (n = 6221). linear regression models were applied to examine the associations between genetic liability to crc and circulating metabolites measured in the same individuals at age 8 y, 16 y, 18 y, and 25 y. results: the grs for crc was associated with up to 28% of the circulating metabolites at fdr-p < 0.05 across all time points, particularly with higher fatty acids and very-low- and low-density lipoprotein subclass lipids. two-sample reverse mendelian randomization (mr) analyses investigating crc liability (52,775 cases, 45,940 controls) and metabolites measured in a random subset of uk biobank participants (n = 118,466, median age 58 y) revealed broadly consistent effect estimates with the grs analysis. in conventional (forward) mr analyses, genetically predicted polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations were most strongly associated with higher crc risk. conclusions: these analyses suggest that higher genetic liability to crc can cause early alterations in systemic metabolism and suggest that fatty acids may play an important role in crc development. funding: this work was supported by the elizabeth blackwell institute for health research, university of bristol, the wellcome trust, the medical research council, diabetes uk, the university of bristol nihr biomedical research centre, and cancer research uk. the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. this work used the computational facilities of the advanced computing research centre, university of bristol http://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/.",AB_0071
"backgroundup to 75% of residents from residential aged care facilities (racf) are transferred to emergency departments (ed) annually to access assessment and care for unplanned or acute health events. emergency department presentations of racf residents can be both expensive and risky, and many are unnecessary and preventable. processes or triage systems to assess residents with a health event, prior to transfer, may reduce unnecessary ed transfer. the aged care emergency (ace) service is a nurse-led ed outreach service that provides telephone support to racf nurses regarding residents' health events. this service is available monday to friday, 8am to 4 pm (ed ace hours). the primary objective of this study was to assess whether the augmentation of the phone-based ed ace service with the addition of a visual telehealth consultation (vtc) would reduce racf rate of ed presentations compared to usual care. the secondary objectives were to 1) monitor presentations to ed within 48 h post vtc to detect any adverse events and 2) measure racf staff perceptions of vtc useability and acceptability.methodsthis implementation study used a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial design. study settings were four public hospital eds and 16 racfs in two local health districts. each ed was linked to 4 racfs with approximately 350 racf beds, totalling 1435 beds across 16 participating racfs. facilities were randomised into eight clusters with each cluster comprising one ed and two racfs.resultsa negative binomial regression demonstrated a 29% post-implementation reduction in the rate of ed presentations (per 100 racf beds), within ed ace hours (irr [95% ci]: 0.71 [0.46, 1. 09]; p = 0.122). a 29% reduction, whilst not statistically significant, is still clinically important and impactful for residents and eds. a post-hoc logistic regression demonstrated a statistically significant 69% reduction in the probability that an episode of care resulted in an ed presentation within ed ace hours post-implementation compared to pre-implementation (or [95% ci]: 0.31 [0.11, 0.87]; p = 0.025).conclusionfindings have shown the positive impact of augmenting ace with a vtc. any reduction of resident presentations to a busy ed is beneficial to healthcare overall, but more so to the individual older person who can recover safely and comfortably in their own racf.trial registrationaustralian new zealand clinical trials registry (id actr n12619001692123) (02/12/2019) https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=378629andisreview=true",AB_0071
"heme participates in a wide range of biological functions such as oxygen transport, electron transport, oxygen reduction, transcriptional regulation and so on. while the mechanism of each function has been investigated for many heme proteins, the origin of the diversity of the heme functions is still unclear and a crucial scientific issue. we have constructed a database of heme proteins, named python-based database and analyzer for distortion of heme porphyrin (pydish), which also contains some analysis tools. the aim of pydish is to integrate the information on the structures of hemes and heme proteins and the functions of heme proteins. this database will provide the structure-function relationships focusing on heme porphyrin distortion and lead to the elucidation of the origin of the functional diversity of heme proteins. in addition, the insights obtained from the database can be used for the design of protein function. pydish contains the structural data of more than 13 000 hemes extracted from the protein data bank, including heme porphyrin distortion, axial ligands coordinating to the heme and the orientation of the propionate sidechains of heme. pydish also has information about the protein domains, including uniprot id, protein fold by cath id, organism, coordination distance and so on. the analytical tools implemented in pydish allow users to not only browse and download the data but also analyze the structures of heme porphyrin by using the analytical tools implemented in pydish. pydish users will be able to utilize the obtained results for the design of protein function.database url: http://pydish.bio.info.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/",AB_0071
"backgroundpregnancy, birth, and early parenthood are significant life experiences impacting women and their families. growing evidence suggests models of maternity care impact clinical outcomes and birth experiences. the aim of this study was to explore the strengths and limitations of different maternity models of care accessed by women in australia who had given birth in the past 5 years.methodsthe data analysed and presented in this paper is from the australian birth experience study (best), an online national survey of 133 questions that received 8,804 completed responses. there were 2,909 open-ended comments in response to the question on health care provider/s. the data was analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics.resultsin models of fragmented care, including standard public hospital care (sc), high-risk care (hrc), and gp shared care (gps), women reported feelings of frustration in being unknown and unheard by their health care providers (hcp) that included themes of exhaustion in having to repeat personal history and the difficulty in navigating conflicting medical advice. women in continuity of care (coc) models, including midwifery group practice (mgp), private obstetric (pob), and privately practising midwifery (ppm), reported positive experiences of healing past birth trauma and care extending for multiple births. compared across models of care in private and public settings, comments in hrc contained the lowest percentage of strengths (11.94%) and the highest percentage of limitations (88.06%) while comments in ppm revealed the highest percentage of strengths (95.93%) and the lowest percentage of limitations (4.07%).conclusionswomen across models of care in public and private settings desire relational maternity care founded on their unique needs, wishes, and values. the strengths of continuity of care, specifically private midwifery, should be recognised and the limitations for women in high risk maternity care investigated and prioritised by policy makers and managers in health services.trial registrationthe study is part of a larger project that has been retrospectively registered with osf registries registration doi https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/4kqxp.",AB_0071
"sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (sglt2) inhibitors have both glucose-lowering and diuretic effects. we recently reported that the sglt2 inhibitor dapagliflozin exerts short-term fluid homeostatic action in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd). however, the long-term effects of sglt2 inhibitors on body fluid status in patients with ckd remain unclear. this was a prospective, non-randomized, open-label study that included a dapagliflozin treatment group (n = 73) and a control group (n = 24) who were followed for 6 months. body fluid volume was measured using a bioimpedance analysis device. the extracellular water-to-total body water ratio (ecw/tbw), a predictor of renal outcomes, was used as a parameter for body fluid status (fluid retention, 0.400 <= ecw/tbw). six-month treatment with dapagliflozin significantly decreased ecw/tbw compared with the control group (-0.65% +/- 2.03% vs. 0.97% +/- 2.49%, p = 0.0018). furthermore, dapagliflozin decreased the ecw/tbw in patients with baseline fluid retention, but not in patients without baseline fluid retention (-1.47% +/- 1.93% vs. -0.01% +/- 1.88%, p = 0.0017). vasopressin surrogate marker copeptin levels were similar between the control and dapagliflozin groups at 6 months (32.3 +/- 33.4 vs. 30.6 +/- 30.1 pmol/l, p = 0.8227). however, dapagliflozin significantly increased the change in copeptin levels at 1 week (39.0% +/- 41.6%, p = 0.0010), suggesting a compensatory increase in vasopressin secretion to prevent hypovolemia. renin and aldosterone levels were similar between the control and dapagliflozin groups at 6 months, while epinephrine and norepinephrine (markers of sympathetic nervous system activity) were significantly lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the control group. in conclusion, the sglt2 inhibitor dapagliflozin ameliorated fluid retention and maintained euvolemic fluid status in patients with ckd, suggesting that sglt2 inhibitors exert sustained fluid homeostatic actions in patients with various fluid backgrounds.clinical trial registration: https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/, identifier [umin000048568].",AB_0071
