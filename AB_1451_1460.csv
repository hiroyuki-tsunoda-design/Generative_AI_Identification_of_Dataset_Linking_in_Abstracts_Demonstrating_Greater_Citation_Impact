"permafrost over the qinghai-tibet plateau (qtp) has received increasing attention due to its high sensitivity to climate change. numerous spatial modeling studies have been conducted on the qtp to assess the status of permafrost, project future changes in permafrost, and diagnose contributors to permafrost degradation. due to the scarcity of ground stations on the qtp, these modeling studies are often hampered by the lack of validation references, calibration targets, and model constraints; however, a high-quality permafrost distribution map would be a good option as a benchmark for spatial simulations. existing permafrost distribution maps for the qtp can poorly serve this purpose. an ideal benchmark map for spatial modeling should be methodologically sound, of sufficient accuracy, and based on observations from mapping years rather than all historical data spanning several decades. therefore, in this study, we created a new permafrost distribution map for the qtp in 2010 using a novel permafrost mapping approach with satellite-derived ground surface thawing and freezing indices as inputs and survey-based subregion permafrost maps as constraints. this approach accounted for the effects of local factors by incorporating (into the model) an empirical soil parameter whose values were optimally estimated through spatial clustering and parameter optimization constrained by survey-based subregion permafrost maps, and the approach was also improved to reduce parametric equifinality. this new map showed a total permafrost area of about 1.086x10(6) km(2) (41.2 % of the qtp area) and seasonally frozen ground of about 1.447x10(6) km(2) (54.9 %) in 2010, excluding glaciers and lakes. validations using survey-based subregion permafrost maps (kappa=0.74) and borehole records (overall accuracy =0.85 and kappa=0.43) showed a higher accuracy of this map compared with two other recent maps. inspection of regions with obvious distinctions between the maps affirms that the permafrost distribution on this map is more realistic than that on the zou et al. (2017) map. given the demonstrated excellent accuracy, this map can serve as a benchmark map for constraining/validating land surface simulations on the qtp and as a historical reference for projecting future permafrost changes on the qtp in the context of global warming. the dataset is available from the repository hosted on figshare (cao et al., 2022): https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19642362.",AB_0146
"backgroundmachine learning radiomics models are increasingly being used to predict gastric cancer prognoses. however, the methodological quality of these models has not been evaluated. therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the methodological quality of radiomics studies in predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer, summarize their methodological characteristics and performance.methodsthe pubmed and embase databases were searched for radiomics studies used to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer published in last 5 years. the characteristics of the studies and the performance of the models were extracted from the eligible full texts. the methodological quality, reporting completeness and risk of bias of the included studies were evaluated using the rqs, tripod and probast. the discrimination ability scores of the models were also compared.resultsout of 283 identified records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. the study endpoints included survival time, treatment response, and recurrence, with reported discriminations ranging between 0.610 and 0.878 in the validation dataset. the mean overall rqs value was 15.32 & plusmn; 3.20 (range: 9 to 21). the mean adhered items of the 35 item of tripod checklist was 20.45 & plusmn; 1.83. the probast showed all included studies were at high risk of bias.conclusionthe current methodological quality of gastric cancer radiomics studies is insufficient. large and reasonable sample, prospective, multicenter and rigorously designed studies are required to improve the quality of radiomics models for gastric cancer prediction.study registrationthis protocol was prospectively registered in the open science framework registry (https://osf.io/ja52b).",AB_0146
"the development of ion mobility-mass spectrometry (im-ms) has revolutionized the analysis of small molecules, such as metabolomics, lipidomics, and exposome studies. the curation of comprehensive reference collision cross-section (ccs) databases plays a pivotal role in the successful application of im-ms for small-molecule analysis. in this study, we presented allccs2, an enhanced version of allccs, designed for the universal prediction of the ion mobility ccs values of small molecules. allccs2 incorporated newly available experimental ccs data, including 10,384 records and 7713 unified values, as training data. by leveraging a neural network trained on diverse molecular representations encompassing mass spectrometry features, molecular descriptors, and graph features extracted using a graph convolutional network, allccs2 achieved exceptional prediction accuracy. allccs2 achieved median relative error (medre) values of 0.31, 0.72, and 1.64% in the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively, surpassing existing ccs prediction tools in terms of accuracy and coverage. furthermore, allccs2 exhibited excellent compatibility with different instrument platforms (dtims, twims, and tims). the prediction uncertainties in allccs2 from the training data and the prediction model were comprehensively investigated by using representative structure similarity and model prediction variation. notably, small molecules with high structural similarities to the training set and lower model prediction variation exhibited improved accuracy and lower relative errors. in summary, allccs2 serves as a valuable resource to support applications of im-ms technologies. the allccs2 database and tools are freely accessible at http://allccs.zhulab.cn/.",AB_0146
"motivation: accumulating clinical evidence shows that circular rna (circrna) plays an important regulatory role in the occurrence and development of human diseases, which is expected to provide a new perspective for the diagnosis and treatment of related diseases. using computational methods can provide high probability preselection for wet experiments to save resources. however, due to the lack of neighborhood structure in sparse biological networks, the model based on network embedding and graph embedding is difficult to achieve ideal results. results: in this paper, we propose biodgw-cmi, which combines biological text mining and wavelet diffusionbased sparse network structure embedding to predict circrna-mirna interaction (cmi). in detail, biodgwcmi first uses the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (bert) for biological text mining to mine hidden features in rna sequences, then constructs a cmi network, obtains the topological structure embedding of nodes in the network through heat wavelet diffusion patterns. next, the denoising autoencoder organically combines the structural features and gaussian kernel similarity, finally, the feature is sent to lightgbm for training and prediction. biodgw-cmi achieves the highest prediction performance in all three datasets in the field of cmi prediction. in the case study, all the 8 pairs of cmi based on circ-itch were successfully predicted. availability: the data and source code can be found at https://github.com/1axin/biodgw-cmi-model.",AB_0146
"background: the continued development of information technology has led to the emergence of online medical consultation platforms. online virtual doctor teams, a new model in online medical care, have received significant attention for their ability to provide increased social support to patients. many scholars have explored the role of social support in doctor-patient communication, usually focusing on a linear relationship between the impact of social support on medical outcomes. in the present study, we will explore the existence of a nonlinear relationship between the two. methods: in the present study, we use doctor teams from a leading online consultation platform in china-haodf online (https://www.haodf.com), as our research object. in total, 610 doctor teams and 413,778 consultation records spanning from june 2017 to november 2019 are collected and used to explore how social support supplied by doctor teams during interactive communication would affect the establishment of long-term doctor-patient relationships. we also explore the moderating role of team leadership type in this process. from the perspective of social support theory, we select representative factors of informational support and emotional support provided by doctor teams, namely, medical term use and emotional expression. we use text and sentiment analysis methods to extract social support contained in the texts of online doctor team-patient interactions and classify doctor teams into strong and weak leadership types based on leader-member status distance. further, we used a logistic regression model to empirically analyze the nonlinear relationship between social support and long-term doctor-patient relationship establishment and the moderating effects of team leadership types in this process. results: the present results show that inverted u-shaped relationships exist among medical term use, emotional expression, and long-term doctor-patient relationship establishment, respectively. doctor teams with strong leadership type make the inverted u-shaped curve between medical term use and long-term doctor-patient relationship establishment flatter than teams with weak leadership type. conclusion: in the present study, we enrich the application of social support theory in the field of online health consultation and provide suggestions for how different types of online doctor teams provide social support to patients.",AB_0146
"multi-model data can enhance brain tumor segmentation for the rich information it provides. however, it also introduces some redundant information that interferes with the segmentation estimation, as some modalitiesmay catch features irrelevant to the tissue of interest. besides, the ambiguous boundaries and irregulate shapes of different grade tumors lead to a non-confidence estimate of segmentation quality. given these concerns, we exploit an uncertainty-guided u-shaped transformer with multiple heads to construct drop-out format masks for robust training. specifically, our drop-out masks are composed of boundary mask, prior probability mask, and conditional probability mask, which can help our approach focus more on uncertainty regions. extensive experimental results show that our method achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation methods, achieving average dice coefficients of 91.37% and hausdorff distance of 4.91 on the brats2021 dataset. our code is freely available at https:// github.com/ chaineypung/bts-ugt",AB_0146
"the imaging quality of an uncooled long wave infrared camera suffers severely from time-drifted spatial noises if not regulated by a thermoelectric cooler (tec). these noises can be categorized within the frequency domain as either fixed pattern noise (fpn) or low-frequency noise (lpn). the time-drifted fpn is primarily governed by the temperature fluctuations of the focal plane array (fpa), whereas the lpn predominantly originates from nonuniform background radiations. most existing methods have been proposed to address the fpn or lpn independently rather than from a unified perspective. in this paper, a self-supervised convolution neural network (cnn) is proposed to remove these two types of noise simultaneously. because of the combination of the deep image prior (dip) architecture and the total variation (tv) regularizer, this method is named tv-dip. with the assumption that the spatial noises are constant in a short period of time, the spatial noise pattern is extracted directly from multiple continuous raw frames without ground-truth noise-free images. in this way, the noise pattern can be updated periodically during running time, without requiring the use of a mechanical shutter. besides, the original tv regularizer is extended with a variable step, which shows a significant enhancement on the lpn denoising task. furthermore, both simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that this approach achieves better performance in terms of the removal of spatial noise, the preservation of detail, and the suppression of artifacts. the source code and dataset are available on the website: https://github.com/brunolinux/tv-dip",AB_0146
"antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern. the lack of innovations in antibiotic development has led to renewed interest in antibiotic adjuvants. however, there is no database to collect antibiotic adjuvants. herein, we build a comprehensive database named antibiotic adjuvant database (aadb) by manually collecting relevant literature. specifically, aadb includes 3,035 combinations of antibiotics with adjuvants, covering 83 antibiotics, 226 adjuvants, and 325 bacterial strains. aadb provides user-friendly interfaces for searching and downloading. users can easily obtain these datasets for further analysis. in addition, we also collected related datasets (e.g., chemogenomic and metabolomic data) and proposed a computational strategy to dissect these datasets. as a test case, we identified 10 candidates for minocycline, and 6 of 10 candidates are the known adjuvants that synergize with minocycline to inhibit the growth of e. coli bw25113. we hope that aadb can help users to identify effective antibiotic adjuvants. aadb is freely available at http://www.acdb.plus/aadb.",AB_0146
