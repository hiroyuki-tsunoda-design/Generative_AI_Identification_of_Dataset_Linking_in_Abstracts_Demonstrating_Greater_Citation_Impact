"skeleton-based action sequences are widely used for human behaviour understanding due to their compact characteristics. most existing work designed graph convolutional networks and integrated multiple input channels rather than the original motion sequence to improve the final performance. however, few of them have been reported on the detailed effects of such multiple input channels. in contrast to them, we systemically study the impact of different input channels and construct a more efficient gcn framework. we have identified the complementary effect between the local frame channel and global sequence channel, which is essential to improve the action recognition accuracy. by coupling local frame and global sequence information with a classical spatial-temporal graph neural network, e.g. ms-g3d, it achieves competitive performance compared with sota methods on challeng-ing benchmark datasets. related code would be available at https://github.com/movearbitrarily/multi-stream.(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0013
"land surface temperature (ts) and near-surface air temperature (ta) are key parameters in multiple research fields. in this study, a global seamless (without missing values) and high-resolution (30 arcsecond spatial res-olution) temperature (for both ts and ta) dataset (gshtd) from 2001 to 2020 was developed. first, a method called the estimation of the temperature difference (etd) was proposed to reconstruct both clear-and cloudy-sky ts. a global seamless 8-day and monthly average all-and clear-sky ts data were then created using the modis ts data and the etd method. the seamless monthly average of the mean, maximum and minimum ta data were further developed using the seamless ts data, in situ ta data and cubist machine learning algorithm. gshtd has four main advantages. first, gshtd includes seven types of temperature data: clear-sky daytime and nighttime ts, all-sky daytime and nighttime ts, and mean, maximum and minimum ta. second, it has global coverage and high spatial resolution. third, using the etd method proposed in this study, gshtd has no missing values. fourth, the accuracy of gshtd is high; the average mean absolute errors (maes) of etd in reconstructing the 25 x 25 and 150 x 150 pixel clear-sky daytime (nighttime) ts data were 0.724 (0.552) and 1.024 (0.895) degrees c, respectively. the maes of etd were on average 23.2% and 23.7% lower than those of remotely sensed daily land surface temperature reconstruction (rsdast) and interpolation of the mean anomalies (imas). the maes of the estimated monthly average of the mean, maximum and minimum ta data were 0.797, 0.994 and 1.056 degrees c, respectively. the developed gshtd is freely available at middle yangtze river geoscience date center (https://cjgeodata.cug.edu.cn/#/pagedetail?id=97), which will be useful in many studies related to climate change, environmental science and ecology, and epidemiology and human health.",AB_0013
"the dictionary pair learning (dpl) model aims to design a synthesis dictionary and an analysis dictionary to accomplish the goal of rapid sample encoding. in this article, we propose a novel structured representation learning algorithm based on the dpl for image classification. it is referred to as discriminative dpl with scale-constrained structured representation (dpl-scsr). the proposed dpl-scsr utilizes the binary label matrix of dictionary atoms to project the representation into the corresponding label space of the training samples. by imposing a non-negative constraint, the learned representation adaptively approximates a block-diagonal structure. this innovative transformation is also capable of controlling the scale of the block-diagonal representation by enforcing the sum of within-class coefficients of each sample to 1, which means that the dictionary atoms of each class compete to represent the samples from the same class. this implies that the requirement of similarity preservation is considered from the perspective of the constraint on the sum of coefficients. more importantly, the dpl-scsr does not need to design a classifier in the representation space as the label matrix of the dictionary can also be used as an efficient linear classifier. finally, the dpl-scsr imposes the l(2,p)-norm on the analysis dictionary to make the process of feature extraction more interpretable. the dpl-scsr seamlessly incorporates the scale-constrained structured representation learning, within-class similarity preservation of representation, and the linear classifier into one regularization term, which dramatically reduces the complexity of training and parameter tuning. the experimental results on several popular image classification datasets show that our dpl-scsr can deliver superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art (sota) dictionary learning methods. the matlab code of this article is available at https://github.com/chenzhe207/dpl-scsr.",AB_0013
"tbplas is an open-source software package for the accurate simulation of physical systems with arbitrary geometry and dimensionality utilizing the tight-binding (tb) theory. it has an intuitive object-oriented python application interface (api) and cython/fortran extensions for the performance-critical parts, ensuring both flexibility and efficiency. under the hood, numerical calculations are mainly performed by both exact diagonalization and the tight-binding propagation method (tbpm) without diagonalization. especially, the tbpm is based on the numerical solution of the time-dependent schrodinger equation, achieving linear scaling with system size in both memory and cpu costs. consequently, tbplas provides a numerically cheap approach to calculate the electronic, optical, plasmon and transport properties of large tight-binding models with billions of atomic orbitals. current capabilities of tbplas include the calculations of band structure, density of states, local density of states, quasi-eigenstates, optical conductivity, electrical conductivity, hall conductivity, polarization function, dielectric function, plasmon dispersion, carrier mobility and velocity, localization length and free path, z2 topological invariant, wave-packet propagation, etc. all the properties can be obtained with only a few lines of code. other algorithms involving tight-binding hamiltonians can be implemented easily due to the extensible and modular nature of the code. in this paper, we discuss the theoretical framework, implementation details and common workflow of tbplas, and give a few demonstrations of its applications.program summary program title: tbplascpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /5cjmzj9jwm .1code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /8296734licensing provisions: bsd 3-clauseprogramming language: python, cython, fortrannature of problem: the tb method is a powerful tool for investigating the electronic structures and many other properties in condensed matter physics. however, the costs of memory and cpu time using standard diagonalization-based tb techniques scale as o (n2) and o (n3) with the model size n, severely limiting their applications in large complex systems. the development of numerical methods to solve tb problems without any diagonalization, as well as the implementation of these techniques in software packages, are urgently needed to promote the capability of tb methods to large systems with billions of atoms.solution method: we proposed the tbpm and implemented it in the tbplas package. in tbpm, the electronic properties of a tb model are calculated numerically by solving the time-dependent schrodinger equation without any diagonalization, which ensures a linear scaling of both memory and cpu costs with the system size. models with billions of atoms (orbitals) can be easily handled, with many properties available from the evolution of time-dependent correlation functions. the tbplas package features an intuitive object-oriented python api and cython/fortran extensions for performance-critical parts, ensuring both flexibility and efficiency. moreover, tbplas implements hybrid mpi+openmp parallelism, which can exploit the modern hardware of high-performance computers.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0013
"background anthropomorphic phantoms are used in surgical planning and intervention. ideal accuracy and high efficiency are prerequisites for its clinical application. we aimed to develop a fully automated artificial intelligence-based three-dimensional (3d) reconstruction system (ai system) to assist thoracic surgery and to determine its accuracy, efficiency, and safety for clinical use.methods this ai system was developed based on a 3d convolutional neural network (cnn) and optimized by gradient descent after training with 500 cases, achieving a dice coefficient of 89.2%. accuracy was verified by comparing virtual structures predicted by the ai system with anatomical structures of patients in retrospective (n = 113) and prospective cohorts (n = 139) who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy at the peking university cancer hospital. operation time and blood loss were compared between the retrospective cohort (without ai assistance) and prospective cohort (with ai assistance) for safety evaluation. the time consumption for reconstruction and the quality score were compared between the ai system and manual reconstruction software (mimics (r)) for efficiency validation. this study was registered at https://www.chictr.org.cn as chictr2100050985.findings the ai system reconstructed 13,608 pulmonary segmental branches from retrospective and prospective cohorts, and 1573 branches of interest corresponding to phantoms were detectable during the operation for verifi- cation, achieving 100% and 97% accuracy for segmental bronchi, 97.2% and 99.1% for segmental arteries, and 93.2% and 98.8% for segmental veins, respectively. with the assistance of the ai system, the operation time was shortened by 24.5 min for lobectomy (p < 0.001) and 20 min for segmentectomy (p = 0.007). compared to mimics (r), the ai system reduced the model reconstruction time by 14.2 min (p < 0.001), and it also outperformed mimics (r) in model quality scores (p < 0.001).interpretation the ai system can accurately predict thoracic anatomical structures with higher efficiency than manual reconstruction software. constant optimization and larger population validation are required.funding this study was funded by the beijing natural science foundation (no. l222020) and other sources.copyright (c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().keywords: artificial intelligence; three-dimensional reconstruction model; anatomy; accuracy; safety; efficiency",AB_0013
"the lack of representative features between benign nodules, especially level 3 of thyroid imaging reporting and data system (ti-rads), and malignant nodules limits diagnostic accuracy, leading to inconsistent interpre-tation, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary biopsies. we propose a vision-transformer-based (vit) thyroid nodule classification model using contrast learning, called tc-vit, to improve accuracy of diagnosis and specificity of biopsy recommendations. vit can explore the global features of thyroid nodules well. nodule images are used as roi to enhance the local features of the vit. contrast learning can minimize the representation distance between nodules of the same category, enhance the representation consistency of global and local features, and achieve accurate diagnosis of ti-rads 3 or malignant nodules. the test results achieve an accuracy of 86.9%. the evaluation metrics show that the network outperforms other classical deep learning-based networks in terms of classification performance. tc-vit can achieve automatic classification of ti-rads 3 and malignant nodules on ultrasound images. it can also be used as a key step in computer-aided diagnosis for comprehensive analysis and accurate diagnosis. the code will be available at https://github.com/jiawei217/tc-vit.",AB_0013
"motivation: post-translational modification (ptm) is an important biochemical process. which includes six most well-studied types: phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation and glycosylation. ptm is involved in various cell signaling pathways and biological processes. abnormal ptm status is closely associated with severe diseases (such as cancer and neurologic diseases) by regulating protein functions, such as protein-protein interactions (ppis). a set of databases was constructed separately for ptm sites and ppi; however, the resource of regulation for ptm on ppi is still unsolved. results: here, we firstly constructed a public accessible database of ptmint (ptms that are associated with ppis) ((https://ptmint.sjtu.edu.cn/) that contains manually curated complete experimental evidence of the ptm regulation on ppis in multiple organisms, including homo sapiens, arabidopsis thaliana, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe. currently, the first version of ptmint encompassed 2477 non-redundant ptm sites in 1169 proteins affecting 2371 protein-protein pairs involving 357 diseases. various annotations were systematically integrated, such as protein sequence, structure properties and protein complex analysis. ptmint database can help to insight into disease mechanism, disease diagnosis and drug discovery associated with ptm and ppi.",AB_0013
"multimodal sentiment analysis aims to judge the sentiment of multimodal data uploaded by the internet users on various social media platforms. on one hand, existing studies focus on the fusion mechanism of multimodal data such as text, audio and visual, but ignore the similarity of text and audio, text and visual, and the heterogeneity of audio and visual, resulting in deviation of sentiment analysis. on the other hand, multimodal data brings noise irrelevant to sentiment analysis, which affects the effectness of fusion. in this paper, we propose a polar-vector and strength-vector mixer model called ps-mixer, which is based on mlp-mixer, to achieve better communication between different modal data for multimodal sentiment analysis. specifically, we design a polar-vector (pv) and a strength-vector (sv) for judging the polar and strength of sentiment separately. pv is obtained from the communication of text and visual features to decide the sentiment that is positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. sv is gained from the communication between the text and audio features to analyze the sentiment strength in the range of 0 to 3. furthermore, we devise an mlp-communication module (mlp-c) composed of several fully connected layers and activation functions to make the different modal features fully interact in both the horizontal and the vertical directions, which is a novel attempt to use mlp for multimodal information communication. finally, we mix pv and sv to obtain a fusion vector to judge the sentiment state. the proposed ps-mixer is tested on two publicly available datasets, cmu-mosei and cmu-mosi, which achieves the state-of-the-art (sota) performance on cmu-mosei compared with baseline methods. the codes are available at: https://github.com/metaphysicser/ps-mixer.",AB_0013

"the widespread of sars-cov-2 presents a significant threat to human society, as well as public health and economic development. extensive efforts have been undertaken to battle against the pandemic, whereas effective approaches such as vaccination would be weakened by the continuous mutations, leading to considerable attention being attracted to the mutation prediction. however, most previous studies lack attention to phylo-genetics. in this paper, we propose a novel and effective model tempo for predicting the mutation of sars-cov-2 evolution. specifically, we design a phylogenetic tree-based sampling method to generate sequence evolution data. then, a transformer-based model is presented for the site mutation prediction after learning the high-level representation of these sequence data. we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of tempo, leveraging a large-scale sars-cov-2 dataset. experimental results show that tempo is effective for mutation prediction of sars-cov-2 evolution and outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods. we further perform mutation prediction experiments of other infectious viruses, to explore the feasibility and robustness of tempo, and experimental results verify its superiority. the codes and datasets are freely available at https://github. com/zjudataintelligence/tempo.",AB_0013
