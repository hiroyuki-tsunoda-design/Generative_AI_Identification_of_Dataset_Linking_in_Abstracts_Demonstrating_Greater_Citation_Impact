"fitevt is a fortran program designed to analyze recorded arrival times of nuclear-decay events affected by dead-time. the primary goal of the program is precise and accurate determination of half-lives. its method involves imposition of a known sufficiently long extending dead-time to the recorded event sequence, so that the original dead-time effects are completely obliterated and the remaining live-times of the survived events are known exactly. upon completion of the analysis, the arrival-time spectrum and the live-time spectrum are predicted and compared to those constructed from the survived events.program summaryprogram title: fitevtlicensing provisions: mitcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /scg6p9jxjk.1programming language: fortran (using double precision)nature of problem: accurate determination of the ideal event rate from the observed event rate in a nuclear decay can be a challenging task due to the inevitable presence of detection system's dead -time, whose nature and extent are typically unknown. consequently, the results of nuclear half-life measurements may depend on the method used to correct for event losses due to dead-time. therefore, there is a need for an exact method of data analysis and the means to apply it in order to ensure reproducibility, accuracy and optimized precision of the results.solution method: fitevt performs arrival-time analysis of the recorded events, in which a known, sufficiently large extending dead-time is imposed by means of software, so that in the resulting set of survived events the original dead-time effects are completely replaced by the effects of the imposed dead-time. as a result, the dead-time following each survived event and the remaining live-time preceding each surviving event are known exactly. this allows for application of the maximum-likelihood method of estimation, in which the half-lives as well as the other parameters of the ideal-decay-rate function can be accurately determined.additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: in its original form the program can handle contributions from a constant event rate (i.e., a typical background) plus up to 4 different exponentially -decaying event rates. one of these 4 contributions is allowed to be negative, so that the program can be applied to the general case involving a single two-component decay chain. the employed method of analysis produces accurate results even when the product of the ideal event rate (rho) and the extending dead-time parameter (& utau;e) is as large as 51.2 [1]. example used in the present paper involves simulated events having initial rate of 105 s-1, to which extending dead-time of 64 mu s is imposed. data analysis is based on maximum-likelihood principle, in which minimization of the deviance involves calculations in double precision and determination of its derivatives is based on analytical expressions. this is done in order to optimize precision and accuracy of the results as well as the program execution time.with the provided input data and a typical contemporary laptop computer, the program execution typically lasts about 5 minutes. reducing the imposed dead-time to zero increases the number of survived events approximately by a factor of 6, but the program execution time increases by about a factor of 3.references[1] v. horvat, j.c. hardy, nucl. instrum. methods phys. res., sect. a 713 (2013) 19.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0067
"rna sequencing (rna-seq) has been a widely used high-throughput method to characterize transcriptomic dynamics spatiotemporally. however, rna-seq data analysis pipelines typically depend on either a sequenced genome and/or corresponding reference transcripts. this limitation is a challenge for species lacking sequenced genomes and corresponding reference transcripts. the nile rat (arvicanthis niloticus) has two key features - it is daytime active, and it is prone to diet-induced diabetes, which makes it more similar to humans than regular laboratory rodents. however, at the time of this study, neither a nile rat genome nor a reference transcript set were available, making it technically challenging to perform large-scale rna-seq based transcriptomic studies. this genome-independent work progressed concurrently with our generation of a nile rat genome. a well -annotated genome requires several iterations of manually reviewing curated transcripts and takes years to achieve. here, we developed a comparative rna-seq pipeline (crsp), integrating a comparative species strategy independent of a specific sequenced genome or species-matched reference transcripts. we performed bench -marking to validate that our crsp tool can accurately quantify gene expression levels. in this study, we generated the first ultra-deep (2.3 billion x 2 paired-end) nile rat rna-seq data from 59 biopsy samples representing 22 major organs, providing a unique resource and spatial gene expression reference for nile rat researchers. importantly, crsp is not limited to the nile rat species and can be applied to any species without prior genomic knowledge. to facilitate a general use of crsp, we also characterized the number of rna-seq reads required for accurate estimation via simulation studies. crsp and documents are available at: https://github.com/pjiang 1105/crsp.",AB_0067
"an algebraic quantum field theory (aqft) may be expressed as a functor from a category of spacetimes to a category of algebras of observables. however, a generic category c whose objects admit interpretation as spacetimes is not necessarily viable as the domain of an aqft functor; often, additional constraints on the morphisms of c must be imposed. we introduce disjointness relations, a generalisation of the orthogonality relations of benini et al. (commun contemp math 23(2):2050007, 2021. https:// doi.org/10.1142/s0219199720500078. arxiv:1709.08657 [math-ph]). in any category c equipped with a disjointness relation, we identify a subcategory d-c which is suitable as the domain of an aqft. we verify that when c is the category of all globally hyperbolic spacetimes of dimension d + 1 and all local isometrics, equipped with the disjointness relation of spacelike separation, the specified subcategory d-c is the commonly-used domain loc(d )(+ 1) of relativistic aqfts. by identifying appropriate chiral disjointness relations, we construct a category x loc suitable as domain for chiral conformal field theories (cfts) in two dimensions. we compare this to an established aqft formulation of chiral cfts, and show that any chiral cft expressed in the established formulation induces one defined on chi loc.",AB_0067
"the recent advances in deep learning, generative modeling, and statistical learning have ushered in a renewed interest in traditional cheminformatics tools and methods. quantifying molecular similarity is essential in molecular generative modeling, exploratory molecular synthesis campaigns, and drug -discovery applications to assess how new molecules differ from existing ones. most tools target advanced users and lack general implementations accessible to the larger community. in this work, we introduce artificial intelligence molecular similarity (aimsim), an accessible cheminformatics platform for performing similarity operations on collections of molecules called molecular datasets. aimsim provides a unified platform to perform similarity-based tasks on molecular datasets, such as diversity quantification, out-lier and novelty analysis, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and inter-molecular comparisons. aimsim implements all major binary similarity metrics and molecular fingerprints and is provided as a python package that includes support for command-line use as well as a graphical user interface for code-free utilization with fully interactive plots. program summaryprogram title: aimsimcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /ydbmr9v3g3 .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /vlachosgroup /aimsimlicensing provisions: mit licenseprogramming language: pythonexternal routines: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, rdkit, plotly, scikit-learn, seaborn, mordred, pyyaml, padelpy, scipy, tabulate.nature of problem: calculating and visualizing structural similarity between chemical entities is challeng-ing and has a wide variety of approaches based on niche applications. an accessible tool which unifies these cheminformatics operations is lacking.solution method: python package with a modular, flexible, and interactive approach to molecular finger-printing, clustering, and more advanced cheminformatics operations. includes a graphic user interface (gui) for completely code-free utilization.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0067
"ab initio pseudopotentials are a linchpin of modern molecular and condensed matter electronic structure calculations. in this work, we employ multi-objective optimization to maximize pseudopotential softness while maintaining high accuracy and transferability. to accomplish this, we develop a formulation in which softness and accuracy are simultaneously maximized, with accuracy determined by the ability to reproduce all-electron energy differences between bravais lattice structures, whereupon the resulting pareto frontier is scanned for the softest pseudopotential that provides the desired accuracy in established transferability tests. we employ an evolutionary algorithm to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and apply it to generate a comprehensive table of optimized norm-conserving vanderbilt (oncv) pseudopotentials (https://github .com /sparc -x /spms -psps). we show that the resulting table is softer than existing tables of comparable accuracy, while more accurate than tables of comparable softness. the potentials thus afford the possibility to speed up calculations in a broad range of applications areas while maintaining high accuracy.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0067
"background & aims: metabolic reprogramming, in partic-ular, glycolytic regulation, supports abnormal survival and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and could serve as a therapeutic target. in this study, we sought to identify glycolytic regulators in hcc that could be inhibited to prevent tumor progression and could also be monitored in vivo, with the goal of providing a theragnostic alternative to existing therapies. methods: an orthotopic hcc rat model was used. tumors were stimulated into a high-proliferation state by use of off -target liver ablation and were compared with lower -proliferating controls. we measured in vivo metabolic alter-ation in tumors before and after stimulation, and between stimulated tumors and control tumors using hyperpolarized 13c magnetic resonance imaging (mri) (h(13)c mri). we compared metabolic alterations detected by h(13)c mri to metabolite levels from ex vivo mass spectrometry, mrna levels of key glycolytic regulators, and histopathology. results: glycolytic lactate flux increased within hcc tumors 3 days after tumor stimulation, correlating positively with tu-mor proliferation as measured with ki67. this was associated with a shift towards aerobic glycolysis and downregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway detected by mass spectrometry. mri-measured lactate flux was most closely coupled with pfkfb3 expression and was suppressed with direct inhibition using pfk15. conclusions: inhibition of pfkfb3 prevents glycolytic-mediated hcc proliferation, trackable by in vivo h13c mri.

"motivationmultiple sequence alignments (msas) of homologous sequences contain information on structural and functional constraints and their evolutionary histories. despite their importance for many downstream tasks, such as structure prediction, msa generation is often treated as a separate pre-processing step, without any guidance from the application it will be used for. resultshere, we implement a smooth and differentiable version of the smith-waterman pairwise alignment algorithm that enables jointly learning an msa and a downstream machine learning system in an end-to-end fashion. to demonstrate its utility, we introduce smurf (smooth markov unaligned random field), a new method that jointly learns an alignment and the parameters of a markov random field for unsupervised contact prediction. we find that smurf learns msas that mildly improve contact prediction on a diverse set of protein and rna families. as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by connecting our differentiable alignment module to alphafold2 and maximizing predicted confidence, we can learn msas that improve structure predictions over the initial msas. interestingly, the alignments that improve alphafold predictions are self-inconsistent and can be viewed as adversarial. this work highlights the potential of differentiable dynamic programming to improve neural network pipelines that rely on an alignment and the potential dangers of optimizing predictions of protein sequences with methods that are not fully understood.availability and implementationour code and examples are available at: https://githuub.com/spetti/smurf. supplementary informationare available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0067
"for more than 100 years, chemical, physical, and material scientists have proposed competing constitutive models to best characterize the behavior of natural and man-made materials in response to mechanical loading. now, computer science offers a universal solution: neural networks. neural networks are powerful function approximators that can learn constitutive relations from large data without any knowledge of the underlying physics. however, classical neural networks entirely ignore a century of research in constitutive modeling, violate thermodynamic considerations, and fail to predict the behavior outside the training regime. here we design a new family of constitutive artificial neural networks that inherently satisfy common kinematical, thermodynamical, and physical constraints and, at the same time, constrain the design space of admissible functions to create robust approximators, even in the presence of sparse data. towards this goal we revisit the non-linear field theories of mechanics and reverse-engineer the network input to account for material objectivity, material symmetry and incompressibility; the network output to enforce thermodynamic consistency; the activation functions to implement physically reasonable restrictions; and the network architecture to ensure polyconvexity. we demonstrate that this new class of models is a generalization of the classical neo hooke, blatz ko, mooney rivlin, yeoh, and demiray models and that the network weights have a clear physical interpretation in the form of shear moduli, stiffness-like parameters, and exponential coefficients. when trained with classical benchmark data for rubber under uniaxial tension, biaxial extension, and pure shear, our network autonomously selects the best constitutive model and learns its set of parameters. our findings suggest that constitutive artificial neural networks have the potential to induce a paradigm shift in constitutive modeling, from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery. our source code, data, and examples is available at https://github.com/livingmatterlab/cann.(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0067
"tetraoninae (grouse) and meleagridinae (turkeys) are conspicuous representatives of the modern north american avifauna. the pre-pleistocene fossil record of these clades has historically been limited to fragmentary remains, in some cases contributing to confusion rather than improving our understanding of how these charismatic landfowl evolved. we report an exquisitely preserved partial skeleton representing a new species of late miocene phasianid from the ash hollow formation of nebraska. centuriavis lioae n. gen. n. sp. is a phasianid species close in size to modern sage-grouse that diverged prior to the grouse-turkey split, and thus offers insight into the early history of this radiation. the cranial endocast resembles other north american phasianids and differs from odontophorids in exhibiting a strongly projected wulst bordered by a well-defined vallecula. phylogenetic analyses indicate that centuriavis lioae forms a clade with tetraoninae, meleagridinae, and pucrasia macrolopha (koklass pheasant). the new fossil species provides a late miocene minimum calibration for the divergence of these extant taxa from other galliformes and supports the hypothesis of a single dispersal from asia to north america by a lineage that later gave rise to grouse and turkeys. uuid: https://zoobank.org/34ecda2f-f2f2-4c92-a82f-292e23cf2da1",AB_0067
