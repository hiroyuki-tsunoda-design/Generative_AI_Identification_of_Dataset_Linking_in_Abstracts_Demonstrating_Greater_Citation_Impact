"this paper proposes an assessor-guided learning strategy for continual learning where an assessor guides the learning process of a base learner by controlling the direction and pace of the learning process thus allowing an efficient learning of new environments while protecting against the catastrophic interference problem. the assessor is trained in a meta-learning manner with a meta -objective to boost the learning process of the base learner. it performs a soft-weighting mechanism of every sample accepting positive samples while rejecting negative samples. the training objective of a base learner is to minimize a meta-weighted combination of the cross entropy loss function, the dark experience replay (der) loss function and the knowledge distillation loss function whose interactions are controlled in such a way to attain an improved performance. a compensated over-sampling (cos) strategy is developed to overcome the class imbalanced problem of the episodic memory due to limited memory budgets. our approach, assessor-guided learning approach (agla), has been evaluated in the class-incremental and task-incremental learning problems. agla achieves improved performances compared to its competitors while the theoretical analysis of the cos strategy is offered. source codes of agla, baseline algorithms and experimental logs are shared publicly in https://github .com /anwarmaxsum /agla for further study.",AB_0104
"motivation: to capture structural homology in rnas, alignment and folding (af) of rna homologs has been a fundamental framework around rna science. learning sufficient scoring parameters for simultaneous af (saf) is an undeveloped subject because evaluating them is computationally expensive. results: we developed constrain-a gradient-based machine learning method for rich saf scoring. we also implemented consalign-a saf tool composed of constrain's learned scoring parameters. to aim for better af quality, consalign employs (1) transfer learning from well-defined scoring models and (2) the ensemble model between the constrain model and a well-established thermodynamic scoring model. keeping comparable running time, consalign demonstrated competitive af prediction quality among current af tools. availability and implementation: our code and our data are freely available at https://github.com/heartsh/consalignandhttps://github.com/heartsh/consprob-trained.",AB_0104
"gene-set analysis (gsa) dominates the functional interpretation of omics data and downstream hypothesis generation. despite its ability to summarise thousands of measurements into semantically interpretable components, gsa often results in hundreds of significantly enriched gene-sets. however, summarisation and effective visualisation of gsa results to facilitate hypothesis generation is still lacking. while some webservers provide gene-set visualiza-tion tools, there is still a need for tools that can effectively summarize and guide exploration of gsa results. to enable versatility, webservers accept gene lists as input, however, none provide end-to-end solutions for emerging data types such as single-cell and spatial omics. here, we present visse.cloud, a webserver for end-to-end gene-set analysis, offering gene-set summarisation and highly interactive visu-alisation. visse.cloud uses algorithms from our ear-lier r package visse to summarise gsa results by identifying biological themes. we maintain versatility by allowing analysis of gene lists, as well as, analy-sis of raw single-cell and spatial omics data, includ-ing cosmx and xenium data, making visse.cloud the first webserver to provide end-to-end gene-set analysis of sub-cellular localised spatial data. struc-turing the results hierarchically allows swift interac-tive investigations of results at the gene, gene-set, and clusters level. visse.cloud is freely available at https://www.visse.cloud.

"motivation: many ophthalmic disease biomarkers have been identified through comprehensive multiomics profiling, and hold significant potential in advancing the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diseases. meanwhile, the eye itself serves as a natural biomarker for several systemic diseases including neurological, renal, and cardiovascular systems. we aimed to collect and standardize this eye biomarkers information and construct the eye biomarker database (ebd) to provide ophthalmologists with a platform to search, analyze, and download these eye biomarker data. results: in this study, we present the ebd < http://www.eyeseeworld.com/ebd/index.html >, a world-first online compilation comprising 889 biomarkers for 26 ocular diseases and 939 eye biomarkers for 181 systemic diseases. the ebd also includes the information of 78 nonbiomarkers-the objects that have been proven cannot be biomarkers. biological function and network analysis were conducted for these ocular disease biomarkers, and several hub pathways and common network topology characteristics were newly identified, which may promote future ocular disease biomarker discovery and characterizes the landscape of biomarkers for eye diseases at the pathway and network level. the ebd is expected to yield broader utility among developmental biologists and clinical scientists in and outside of the eye field by assisting in the identification of biomarkers linked to eye disorders and related systemic diseases. availability and implementation: ebd is available at http://www.eyeseeworld.com/ebd/index.html.",AB_0104
"a-to-i editing is the most prevalent rna editing event, which refers to the change of adenosine (a) bases to inosine (i) bases in double-stranded rnas. several studies have revealed that a-to-i editing can regulate cellular processes and is associated with various human diseases. therefore, accurate identification of a-to-i editing sites is crucial for understanding rna-level (i.e. transcriptional) modifications and their potential roles in molecular functions. to date, various computational approaches for a-to-i editing site identification have been developed; however, their performance is still unsatisfactory and needs further improvement. in this study, we developed a novel stacked-ensemble learning model, attic (a-to-i editing predictor), to accurately identify a-to-i editing sites across three species, including homo sapiens, mus musculus and drosophila melanogaster. we first comprehensively evaluated 37 rna sequence-derived features combined with 14 popular machine learning algorithms. then, we selected the optimal base models to build a series of stacked ensemble models. the final attic framework was developed based on the optimal models improved by the feature selection strategy for specific species. extensive cross-validation and independent tests illustrate that attic outperforms stateof-the-art tools for predicting a-to-i editing sites. we also developed a web server for attic, which is publicly available at http://web. unimelb-bioinfortools.cloud.edu.au/attic/. we anticipate that attic can be utilized as a useful tool to accelerate the identification of a-to-i rna editing events and help characterize their roles in post-transcriptional regulation.",AB_0104
"in this study, we propose aid-purifier that can boost the robustness of adversarially-trained networks by purifying their inputs. aid-purifier is an auxiliary network that works as an add-on to an already trained main classifier. to keep it computationally light, it is trained as a discriminator with a binary cross entropy loss. to obtain additionally useful information from the adversarial examples, the architecture design is closely related to the information maximization principle where two layers of the main classification network are piped into the auxiliary network. to assist the iterative optimization procedure of purification, the auxiliary network is trained with avmixup. aid-purifier can be also used together with other purifiers such as pixeldefend for an extra enhancement. because input purification has been studied relative less when compared to adversarial training or gradient masking, we conduct extensive attack experiments to validate aid-purifier's robustness. the overall results indicate that the best performing adversarially-trained networks can be enhanced further with aid-purifier. the code is available in https://github.com/yelobean/aidpurifier.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0104
"thanks to earth-level street view images from google maps, a visual image geo-localization can estimate the coarse location of a query image with a visual place recognition process. however, this can get very challenging when non-static objects change with time, severely degrading image retrieval accuracy. we address the problem of city-scale visual place recognition in complex urban environments crowded with non-static clutters. to this end, we first analyze what clutters degrade similarity matching between the query and database images. second, we design a self-supervised trainable de-attention module that pre-vents the network from focusing on non-static objects in an input image. in addition, we propose a novel triplet marginal loss called sharpened triplet marginal loss to make feature descriptors more discriminative. lastly, due to the lack of geo-tagged public datasets with a high density of non-static objects, we propose a clutter augmentation method to evaluate our approach. the experimental results show that our model has notably improved over the existing attention methods in geo-localization tasks on the public bench-mark datasets and on their augmented versions with high population and traffic. our code is available at https://github.com/ccsmm78/deattention _ with _ stml _ for _ vpr .(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd.this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (  )",AB_0104
"having a profound understanding of the surrounding environment is considered one of the crucial tasks for the reliable operation of future self-driving cars. light detection and ranging (lidar) sensor plays a critical role in achieving such understanding due to its capability to perceive the world in 3d. similar to 2d perception tasks, current state-of-the-art methods in 3d perception tasks rely on deep neural networks (dnns). however, the performance of 3d perception tasks, specially point-wise semantic segmentation, is not on par with their 2d counterparts. one of the main reasons is the lack of publicly available labelled 3d point cloud datasets (pcds) from 3d lidar sensors. in this work, we are introducing the voxelscape dataset, a large-scale simulated 3d pcd with 100k annotated point cloud scans. the annotations in the voxelscape dataset include both point-wise semantic labels and 3d bounding box labels. additionally, we used a number of baseline approaches to validate the transferability of voxelscape to real 3d pcd for two challenging 3d perception tasks. the promising results have shown that training dnns on voxelscape boosted the performance of the 3d perception tasks on the real pcd. furthermore, we are also releasing the proposed data generation pipeline for the research community to facilitate realistic simulation of 3d lidar point cloud data for different scenarios beyond those covered in our voxelscape dataset. the voxelscape dataset and the corresponding lidar simulation codes are publicly available at https://voxel-scape.github.io/dataset",AB_0104
"remote devonian exposures in central australia have produced significant but highly fragmentary remains of fish-grade tetrapodomorphs. we describe a new tetrapodomorph from the middle-late devonian (givetian-frasnian) harajica sandstone member of the amadeus basin, northern territory, which is represented by several nearly complete skulls along with much of the body and postcranial skeleton. the new form has a posteriorly broad postparietal shield, broad, triangular extratemporal bones, and a lanceolate parasphenoid. the spiracular openings are particularly large, a character also recorded in elpistostegalians and gogonasus, demonstrating that these structures, suggestive of spiracular surface air-breathing, appeared independently in widely differing nodes of the stem-tetrapod radiation. a phylogenetic analysis resolves the new form within a cluster of osteolepidid-grade taxa, either as part of a polytomy or as the most basally-branching representative of a clade containing 'osteolepidids,' canowindrids, and megalichthyids.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:a21e263e-9b2b-4c9b-9b1b-74b53c2cf535",AB_0104
"background: protein secondary structures that link simple 1d sequences to complex 3d structures can be used as good features for describing the local properties of protein, but also can serve as key features for predicting the complex 3d structures of protein. thus, it is very important to accurately predict the secondary structure of the protein, which contains a local structural property assigned by the pattern of hydrogen bonds formed between amino acids. in this study, we accurately predict protein secondary structure by capturing the local patterns of protein. for this objective, we present a novel prediction model, attsec, based on transformer architecture. in particular, attsec extracts self-attention maps corresponding to pairwise features between amino acid embeddings and passes them through 2d convolution blocks to capture local patterns. in addition, instead of using additional evolutionary information, it uses protein embedding as an input, which is generated by a language model. results: for the proteinnet dssp8 dataset, our model showed 11.8% better performance on the entire evaluation datasets compared with other no-evolutionary-information-based models. for the netsurfp-2.0 dssp8 dataset, it showed 1.2% better performance on average. there was an average performance improvement of 9.0% for the proteinnet dssp3 dataset and an average of 0.7% for the netsurfp-2.0 dssp3 dataset. conclusion: we accurately predict protein secondary structure by capturing the local patterns of protein. for this objective, we present a novel prediction model, attsec, based on transformer architecture. although there was no dramatic accuracy improvement compared with other models, the improvement on dssp8 was greater than that on dssp3. this result implies that using our proposed pairwise feature could have a remarkable effect for several challenging tasks that require finely subdivided classification. github package url is https://github.com/youjin-ddai/attsec.",AB_0104
