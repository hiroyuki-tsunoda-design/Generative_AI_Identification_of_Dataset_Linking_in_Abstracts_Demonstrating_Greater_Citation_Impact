"tunneling ionization is at the core of strong-field and attosecond science. in this paper, we present pystructurefactor - a general python code towards the calculation of the structure factor in the tunneling ionization rate of common molecules under intense laser fields. the numerical implementation is based on the well-developed weak-field asymptotic theory in the integral representation. the information of the electronic structure of the molecules is obtained via the pyscf quantum chemistry package. pystructurefactor is a general computational framework that can be utilized to compute the molecular structure factor of various types of molecules, including polar and nonpolar diatomic molecules, degenerate molecules, and open-shell molecules. examples are given that are benchmarked against known results with good agreements. the present pystructurefactor is implemented in an efficient manner and is easily applicable towards larger molecules. program summary program title: pystructurefactor cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /td88mhw2sg .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /thestaralight /pystructurefactor licensing provisions: apache-2.0 programming language: python 3 nature of problem: the structure factor of a molecule in intense laser fields determines its orientationdependent tunneling ionization rate, which is crucial for the studies of ultrafast molecular dynamics and its control. however, the strong-field community lacks an open-source code to calculate the molecular structure factor, and can only resort to known results of a few molecules. solution method: we developed the pystructurefactor program with the structure factor of arbitrary molecules calculated using the weak-field asymptotic theory in the integral representation. the underlying electronic structure necessary for the calculation is obtained using the pyscf quantum chemistry package. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: the accuracy of the molecular structure factor calculated by pystructurefactor is restricted by the level of precision of the electronic structure information extracted from the pyscf package. the running time depends on the size of the molecule, the basis set of the calculation, the level of precision of the electronic structure calculations, and other parameters passed to the program. the example in fig. 2 took 1.2 seconds to finish on an amd ryzen 9 7950x cpu on the wsl ubuntu 22.04 lts.",AB_0150
"vitiligo lesion segmentation is crucial for the assessment and treatment of vitiligo. there are two significant challenges in this problem, namely, the availability of dense segmentation annotations and the collection of large amounts of vitiligo images, which are also major challenges in medical image analysis (mia). however, most existing methods often heavily rely on the availability of large-scale labeled datasets and high-quality annotations. consequently, the performance of these models may not be easily reproducible or transferable to those domains with limited data availability. as a result, there is a need to develop alternative approaches that can leverage unlabeled datasets for segmentation with a small-scale training set. in this paper, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on image editing, which can synthesize a large number of samples using a small number of annotated data. the synthesized examples are of high visual quality and enforce the segmentation performance without any cost. besides, we also adapt the mean teacher framework for reliable predictions mining from unlabeled samples to alleviate the demands of densely annotated segmentations. we obtain pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples by utilizing highly confident pixels. on the other hand, we proposed a new bimodal vitiligo lesions segmentation (bvls) dataset containing fine-grain segmentation masks and bimodal images usually used for vitiligo diagnosis to mitigate the lack of a vitiligo segmentation dataset. extensive experiments conducted on the blvs dataset demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant improvements (+17.27%) compared with previous data augmentation methods on the unet backbone. furthermore, the semi-supervised framework can reach an iou of 49.71% with only 10% annotated images. our code and dataset are availabel at https://github.com/jcwang20/blvs.",AB_0150
"peak alignment is a crucial step in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms)-based large-scale untargeted metabolomics workflows, as it enables the integration of metabolite peaks across multiple samples, which is essential for accurate data interpretation. slight differences or fluctuations in chromatographic separation conditions, however, can cause the chromatographic retention time (rt) shift between consecutive analyses, ultimately affecting the accuracy of peak alignment between samples. here, we introduce a novel rt shift correction method based on the retention index (ri) and apply it to peak alignment. we synthesized a series of n-acyl glycine (c2-c23) homologues via the amidation reaction between glycine with normal saturated fatty acids (c2-c23) as calibrants able to respond proficiently in both mass spectrometric positive- and negative-ion modes. using these calibrants, we established an n-acyl glycine ri system. this ri system is capable of covering a broad chromatographic space and addressing chromatographic rt shift caused by variations in flow rate, gradient elution, instrument systems, and lc separation columns. moreover, based on the ri system, we developed a peak shift correction model to enhance peak alignment accuracy. applying the model resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of peak alignment from 15.5 to 80.9% across long-term data spanning a period of 157 days. to facilitate practical application, we developed a python-based program, which is freely available at https://github.com/whu-fenglab/ri-based-cpsc.",AB_0150
"the prediction of the drug-target affinity (dta) plays an important role in evaluating molecular druggability. although deep learning-based models for dta prediction have been extensively attempted, there are rare reports on multimodal models that leverage various fusion strategies to exploit heterogeneous information from multiple different modalities of drugs and targets. in this study, we proposed a multimodal deep model named mmdta, which integrated the heterogeneous information from various modalities of drugs and targets using a hybrid fusion strategy to enhance dta prediction. to achieve this, mmdta first employed convolutional neural networks (cnns) and graph convolutional networks (gcns) to extract diverse heterogeneous information from the sequences and structures of drugs and targets. it then utilized a hybrid fusion strategy to combine and complement the extracted heterogeneous information, resulting in the fused modal information for predicting drug-target affinity through the fully connected (fc) layers. experimental results demonstrated that mmdta outperformed the competitive state-of-the-art deep learning models on the widely used benchmark data sets, particularly with a significantly improved key evaluation metric, root mean square error (rmse). furthermore, mmdta exhibited excellent generalization and practical application performance on multiple different data sets. these findings highlighted mmdta's accuracy and reliability in predicting the drug-target binding affinity. for researchers interested in the source data and code, they are accessible at http://github.com/dldxzx/mmdta.",AB_0150
"monitoring-based traffic participant detection (tpd) is a highly desirable but challenging task. so far, deep learning-based methods have attained significant improvements on the tpd task, but oftentimes fail in urban mixed traffic due to the lack of relevant datasets and suitable detectors. in this study, we propose a large and detailed dataset named seu_pml specialized for monitoring-based tpd in urban mixed traffic. this dataset contains a total of 270,684 objects annotated with 2d bounding box and covers 13 sub-categories, having (i) high-resolution images (from 1920 x 1080 to 4096 x 2160 pixels), (ii) high-quality annotation (annotation accuracy reaches 98%), and (iii) rich traffic scenarios covering diverse traffic scenes as well as different weather and illumination conditions. the mixed traffic along with high-quality annotation bring about a variety of small objects. to further address the issue on small object detection, we propose a novel detector named yolo sod, which embeds a super-resolution feature extraction module and uses knowledge distillation to learn the knowledge how the detector with high-resolution inputs perceives small objects. moreover, a novel loss function named s-iou is designed to enable yolo sod to focus more on small objects. experimental results show that (1) the yolo sod detector has an increased map of 1.58% and operates approximately four times faster when compared to a state-of-art detector; (2) the detectors trained on the seu_pml dataset have a strong transferability and could be well applied to traffic participant detection in urban mixed traffic. our dataset is now available at https://github.com/vvgoder/seu_pml_dataset.",AB_0150
"background: autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction, repetitive behavior and language impairment, and its worldwide prevalence has been found to be increasing annually in recent years. till now, asd is uncurable as its pathogenesis remains unknown. however, studies on both animals and humans have demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) may ameliorate the symptoms of asd, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms. nonetheless, there is still no agreement regarding the optimal dosage or duration of fmt treatment for individuals with asd.methods: this clinical study is a double-blind, randomized, interventional trial conducted at a single center. the aim is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a pediatric formulation of fmt for asd. a total of 42 children between the ages of 3-9 with asd will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either an fmt treatment group (n = 28) or a placebo group (n = 14), forming cohort 1. additionally, 30 healthy children of similar age and gender will be recruited as the control group (cohort 2). cohort 1 will be assessed using a variety of scales, including the autism behavior checklist, childhood autism rating scale, social responsiveness scale, gastrointestinal symptom rating scale, children's sleep habits questionnaire, and psychoeducational profile (third edition). these assessments will evaluate the effectiveness of fmt in reducing core symptoms and comorbidities (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and sleep disturbances) in children with asd. the study will use metagenomic and metabolomic sequencing to assess changes in the composition and structure of the intestinal flora and its metabolites in blood, urine, and feces following treatment. furthermore, the study will evaluate the acceptability of the fmt formulation by participants' legal guardians and investigate differences in the intestinal flora and metabolism in the fmt group before and after treatment compared to 30 healthy children.clinical trial registration: https://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier chictr2200058459.",AB_0150
"liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) could provide a large amount of information to assist in metabolites identification. different liquid chromatographic methods (cms) could produce different retention times to the same metabolite. to predict the retention time of local dataset by online datasets has become a trend, but the datasets downloaded from different databases were differences in quantity levels. and the imbalanced data could produce bad influence in model prediction. thus, based on quantitative structure-retention relationships (qsrrs), an ensemble model, named rt-ensemble pred, has been successfully built to predict retention time of different lc-ms systems in this study. a total of 76, 807 metabolites (76, 909 retention times) have been collected across 9 cms, and 19 natural products and 1 antifungal drug (20 retention times) have been collected to test the model applicability. an ensemble sampling was applied for the preprocessing procedure to solve the problem of imbalanced data. based on the ensemble sampling, rt-ensemble pred could better utilize online datasets for the prediction of retention time. rt-ensemble pred was built based on the online datasets and tested by local dataset. the predictive accuracy of rt-ensemble pred was higher than the models without any sampling methods. the results showed that rt-ensemble pred could predict the metabolites which was not included in the database and the metabolites which were from new cms. it could also be used for the prediction of other compounds beside metabolites. furthermore, a tool of rt-ensemble pred was packed and can be freely downloaded at https://gitlab.com/mikic93/rt-ensemble-pred. it provides convenience for the users who need to predict the retention time of metabolites.",AB_0150
"a network based on complementary consistency training, cc-net, has been proposed for semi-supervised left atrium image segmentation. cc-net efficiently utilizes unlabeled data from the perspective of complementary information, addressing the limited ability of existing semi-supervised segmentation algorithms to extract information from unlabeled data. the complementary symmetrical structure of cc-net includes a main model and two auxiliary models. the complementary consistency is formed by the model-level perturbation between the main model and the auxiliary models, enforcing their consistency. the complementary information obtained by the two auxiliary models helps the main model effectively focus on ambiguous areas, while the enforced consistency between models facilitates the acquisition of low-uncertainty decision boundaries. cc-net has been validated in two public datasets. compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms under specific proportions of annotated data, cc-net demonstrates the best performance in semi-supervised segmentation. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cuthbert-huang/cc-net.",AB_0150
"predicting disease-related micrornas(mirnas) and longnoncodingrnas (lncrnas) is crucial to find new biomarkers for the prevention,diagnosis, and treatment of complex human diseases. computationalpredictions for mirna/lncrna-disease associations are of great practicalsignificance, since traditional experimental detection is expensiveand time-consuming. in this paper, we proposed a consensual machine-learningtechnique-based prediction approach to identify disease-related mirnasand lncrnas by high-order proximity preserved embedding (hope) andextreme gradient boosting (xgb), named hopexgb. by connecting lncrna,mirna, and disease nodes based on their correlations and relationships,we first created a heterogeneous disease-mirna-lncrna (dml) informationnetwork to achieve an effective fusion of information on similarities,correlations, and interactions among mirnas, lncrnas, and diseases.in addition, a more rational negative data set was generated basedon the similarities of unknown associations with the known ones, soas to effectively reduce the false negative rate in the data set formodel construction. by 10-fold cross-validation, hope shows betterperformance than other graph embedding methods. the final consensualhopexgb model yields robust performance with a mean prediction accuracyof 0.9569 and also demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity advantagescompared to lncrna/mirna-specific predictions. moreover, it is superiorto other existing methods and gives promising performance on the externaltesting data, indicating that integrating the information on lncrna-mirnainteractions and the similarities of lncrnas/mirnas is beneficialfor improving the prediction performance of the model. finally, casestudies on lung, stomach, and breast cancers indicate that hopexgbcould be a powerful tool for preclinical biomarker detection and bioexperimentpreliminary screening for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers.hopexgb is publicly available at https://github.com/airpamper/hopexgb.",AB_0150
"multiple cropping is a widespread agricultural intensification for increasing food production. national-scale cropping intensity (ci) mapping is important for achieving sustainable development goals. however, previous studies have largely relied on vegetation indices (vi) waves for detecting valid cropping cycles, which is challenged by the complexity of agricultural systems. i.e. winter crops with multiple vi waves and double rice with less distinctive waves. this study proposed a robust framework for mapping cropping intensity through bettercharacterizing crop life cycles based on combined considerations of vegetative and productive stages (mils). the number of cropping cycles was estimated by the frequency of valid coupled patterns of vegetation and brownness indices from sentinel-2 (s2) multispectral instrument (msi) time series and further improved through fusing sentinel-1 (s1) sar and s2 data to reduce the omission errors of double rice. the mils algorithm was implemented using the google earth engine platform and applied to china, which is dominated by smallholder farms with diverse cropping patterns. this study produced the first 10 m updated ci map over conterminous china (cichina10m) in 2020 by fusing s1 and s2 time series. the cichina10m had an overall accuracy of 93.93% when validated with 14,468 widely spread reference sites. the cropping intensity was 1.2769 on the national scale, which illustrated higher values in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river plain (ci = 1.5879) and south china (ci =1.5503). there were 1086,620, 412,620 and 1,441 km2 areas cultivated by single, double and triple cropping in china, which accounted for 72.4%, 27.5% and 0.1% of cropland, respectively. the proposed mils algorithm showed good performances in detecting complex agricultural systems, which can be further applied to generate continental or global 10-m ci products with good quality. codes of the mils algorithm are publicly available at https://code.earthengine.google.com/a7f24f76291bf901ee25a130025a7ce6, and the first 10m national ci data products in china with good accuracy (chinaci10m) are also publicly accessed at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23939505.",AB_0150
