"intrinsically disordered proteins (idps) play a vital role in various biological processes and have attracted increasing attention in the past few decades. predicting idps from the primary structures of proteins offers a rapid and facile means of protein analysis without necessitating crystal structures. in particular, machine learning methods have demonstrated their potential in this field. recently, protein language models (plms) are emerging as a promising approach to extracting essential information from protein sequences and have been employed in protein modeling to utilize their advantages of precision and efficiency. in this article, we developed a novel idp prediction method named idp-elm to predict the intrinsically disordered regions (idrs) as well as their functions including disordered flexible linkers and disordered protein binding. this method utilizes high-dimensional representations extracted from several state-of-the-art plms and predicts idrs by ensemble learning based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks. the performance of the method was evaluated on two independent test data sets from caid (critical assessment of protein intrinsic disorder prediction) and caid2, indicating notable improvements in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (auc), matthew's correlation coefficient (mcc), and f1 score. moreover, idp-elm requires solely protein sequences as inputs and does not entail a time-consuming process of protein profile generation, which is a prerequisite for most existing state-of-the-art methods, enabling an accurate, fast, and convenient tool for proteome-level analysis. the corresponding reproducible source code and model weights are available at https://github.com/xu-shi-jie/idp-elm.",AB_0080
"plants employ self-incompatibility (si) to promote cross-fertilization. in brassicaceae, this process is regulated by the formation of a complex between the pistil determinant s receptor kinase (srk) and the pollen determinant slocus protein 11 (sp11, also known as s-locus cysteine-rich protein, scr). in our previous study, we used the crystal structures of two esrk-sp11 complexes in brassica rapa s8 and s9 haplotypes and nine computationally predicted complex models to demonstrate that only the srk ectodomain (esrk) and sp11 pairs derived from the same s haplotype exhibit high binding free energy. however, predicting the esrk-sp11 complex structures for the other 100 + s haplotypes and genera remains difficult because of sp11 polymorphism in sequence and structure. although protein structure prediction using alphafold2 exhibits considerably high accuracy for most protein monomers and complexes, 46% of the predicted sp11 structures that we tested showed < 75 mean perresidue confidence score (plddt). here, we demonstrate that the use of curated multiple sequence alignment (msa) for cysteine-rich proteins significantly improved model accuracy for sp11 and esrk-sp11 complexes. additionally, we calculated the binding free energies of the predicted esrk-sp11 complexes using molecular dynamics (md) simulations and observed that some arabidopsis haplotypes formed a binding mode that was critically different from that of b. rapa s8 and s9. thus, our computational results provide insights into the haplotype-specific esrk-sp11 binding modes in brassicaceae at the residue level. the predicted models are freely available at zenodo, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8047768.",AB_0080
"images captured under low-light conditions often have various issues, such as low brightness and contrast, and also color distortion. the aim of low-light image enhancement is to improve the visual quality of such images to facilitate subsequent image processing and computer vision tasks. however, this task faces major challenges from the inherent limitations of the low-light environment. this paper proposes a novel low-light image enhancement network using a u-shaped enhanced lightening back-projection. the network architecture primarily comprises a series of lightening blocks and a color balance block. we construct the lightening block, which incorporates a ushaped enhanced lightening back-projection module and a saturation-guided fusion module, by assuming that the saturation levels of the low-light and the normal images are similar. additionally, a color balance block is included to address issues such as color fading or over-enhancement. the effectiveness of the proposed network is assessed via extensive experiments conducted on widely-used benchmarks. the simulation results confirm that the proposed low-light enhancement network outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. https://github. com/jyp-1317/.",AB_0080
"motivation the usefulness of supervised molecular property prediction (mpp) is well-recognized in many applications. however, the insufficiency and the imbalance of labeled data make the learning problem difficult. moreover, the reliability of the predictions is also a huddle in the deployment of mpp models in safety-critical fields.results we propose the evidential meta-model for molecular property prediction (em3p2) method that returns uncertainty estimates along with its predictions. our em3p2 trains an evidential graph isomorphism network classifier using multi-task molecular property datasets under the model-agnostic meta-learning (maml) framework while addressing the problem of data imbalance. our results showed better prediction performances compared to existing meta-mpp models. furthermore, we showed that the uncertainty estimates returned by our em3p2 can be used to reject uncertain predictions for applications that require higher confidence.availability and implementation source code available for download at https://github.com/ajou-dilab/em3p2.",AB_0080

"multi-target multi-camera tracking (mtmct) for vehicles, which aims to track multiple vehicles across multi-camera environments, is crucial in surveillance or intelligent transportation systems due to its broad applicability in real situations. however, the high inter-class similarity of vehicles and also their high intra-class variability due to the varying perspective, lighting, and video quality of each camera make it significantly challenging. various offline approaches have been proposed and dominated the field with further advantages over the online strategy, but they are hardly adopted in real-world applications that usually require an online operation. in this paper, we propose a novel fast online mtmct algorithm for vehicles considering better applicability in real applications. during the mtmct, we actively reflect online mtsct results, which is more reliable than clustering results in the multi-camera domain, on top of the object detection and feature extraction. to do so, we can effectively reduce the id switches of the tracks and computational costs by decreasing the number of feature comparisons. as a result, we achieve 77.3 idf1 on the s02 scenario of the cityflow dataset with 0.012 seconds of tracking speed with four camera inputs. the source code is released at https://github.com/kamkyu94/fast_online_mtmct.",AB_0080
"backgrounda simulated education, prior to surgery about postoperative nasal stuffiness and ease of breathing through the mouth may help patients tolerate discomfort after nasal surgery. this study aimed to investigate the effect of preoperative simulated education on immediate postoperative opioid requirements in patients undergoing elective nasal surgery.methodsthis randomized controlled trial of 110 patients undergoing nasal surgery randomly allocated patients into either a control (group c) or an education group (group e). one day before surgery, patients in group e were intensively trained to breathe through the mouth by using a nasal clip, with informative explanations about inevitable nasal obstruction and discomfort following surgery. patients in group c were provided with routine preoperative information. total intravenous anesthesia (tiva) with propofol and remifentanil was used for anesthesia. no further opioid was used for analgesia intraoperatively. the primary outcome was index opioid (fentanyl) requirements at the post-anesthesia recovery unit (pacu). secondary outcomes were emergence agitation, pain scores at the pacu, and postoperative recovery using the quality of recovery-15 (qor15-k).resultsthe rate of opioid use in the pacu was 51.0% in the group e and 39.6% in the group c (p = 0.242). additional request for analgesics other than index opioid was not different between the groups. emergence agitation, postoperative pain severity, and qor15-k scores were comparable between the groups.conclusionpreoperative education with simulated mouth breathing in patients undergoing nasal surgery did not reduce opioid requirements.trial registrationkct0006264; 16/09/2021; clinical research information services (https://cris.nih.go.kr).",AB_0080
"background:intravascular imaging-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with intravascular ultrasound (ivus) or optical coherence tomography (oct) showed superior clinical outcomes compared with angiography-guided pci. however, the comparative effectiveness of oct-guided and ivus-guided pci regarding clinical outcomes is unknown.methods:in this prospective, multicenter, open-label, pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned 2008 patients with significant coronary artery lesions undergoing pci in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either an oct-guided or ivus-guided pci. the primary end point was a composite of death from cardiac causes, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization at 1 year, which was powered for noninferiority of the oct group compared with the ivus group. safety outcomes were also assessed.results:at 1 year, primary end point events occurred in 25 of 1005 patients (kaplan-meier estimate, 2.5%) in the oct group and in 31 of 1003 patients (kaplan-meier estimate, 3.1%) in the ivus group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points; upper boundary of one-sided 97.5% ci, 0.97 percentage points; p<0.001 for noninferiority). the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy was similar (14 patients [1.4%] in the oct group versus 15 patients [1.5%] in the ivus group; p=0.85). the incidence of major procedural complications was lower in the oct group than in the ivus group (22 [2.2%] versus 37 [3.7%]; p=0.047), although imaging procedure-related complications were not observed.conclusions:in patients with significant coronary artery lesions, oct-guided pci was noninferior to ivus-guided pci with respect to the incidence of a composite of death from cardiac causes, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization at 1 year. the selected study population and lower-than-expected event rates should be considered in interpreting the trial.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique number: nct03394079.",AB_0080
