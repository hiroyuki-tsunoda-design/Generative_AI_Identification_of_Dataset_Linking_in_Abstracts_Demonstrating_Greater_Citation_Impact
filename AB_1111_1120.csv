"spinsim simulates the quantum dynamics of unentangled spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems evolving under time-dependent control. while other solvers for the time-dependent schrodinger equation optimize for larger state spaces but less temporally-rich control, spinsim is optimized for intricate time evolution of a minimalist system. efficient simulation of individual or ensemble quanta driven by adiabatic sweeps, elaborate pulse sequences, complex signals and non-gaussian noise is the primary target application. we achieve fast and robust evolution using a geometric integrator to bound errors over many steps, and split the calculation parallel-in-time on a gpu using the numba just-in-time compiler. speed-up is three orders of magnitude over qutip's sesolve and mathematica's ndsolve, and four orders over scipy's ivp_solve for equal accuracy. interfaced through python, spinsim should be useful for simulating robust state preparation, inversion and dynamical decoupling sequences in nmr and mri, and in quantum control, memory and sensing applications with two-and three-level quanta.program summaryprogram title: spinsim cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /f6rdk4gyxr.1developer's repository link: https://github .com /alexander-tritt -monash /spinsimlicensing provisions: bsd 3-clauseprogramming language: python (3.7 or greater)nature of problem: quantum sensing is a domain of quantum technology where the dynamics of quantum systems are used to infer properties of the systems' environments. the development of quantum sensing protocols is greatly sped-up by software simulations of the new techniques. quantum sensing simulation benefits from temporally-rich control of individual quanta. however, current specialized time-dependent schrodinger equation solvers are instead optimized only for simple pulses in large hilbert spaces. thus, there is a need for efficient simulation of individual or ensemble quanta driven by adiabatic sweeps, elaborate pulse sequences, complex signals and non-gaussian noise.solution method: spinsim simulates the quantum dynamics of spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems evolving under time-dependent control. we first speed up the integration of the time-dependent schrodinger equation by splitting the calculation parallel-in-time on a gpu using the numba [1] just-in-time compiler. we achieve fast and robust evolution using a geometric integrator to bound errors over many steps. a dynamic rotating frame transformation and lie-trotter decomposition are used to decrease effective step sizes on long and short time scales, respectively. hence, each individual step is more accurate. spinsim is interfaced via a python package, meaning it can be used by researchers inexperienced with geometric integrators and gpu parallelism.additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: to use the (default) nvidia cuda gpu parallelization, one needs to have a cuda compatible nvidia gpu [2]. for cuda mode to function, one also needs to install the nvidia cuda toolkit [3]. if cuda is not available on the system, the simulator will automatically parallelize over multicore cpus instead. developed and tested on windows 10; tested on windows 11. cpu functionality tested on macos 10.16 big sur (note that macos 10.14 mojave and higher are not compatible with cuda hardware and software). the package (including cuda functionality) is in principle compatible with linux, but functionality has not been tested. references [1] s.k. lam, a. pitrou, s. seibert, in: proceedings of the second workshop on the llvm compiler infrastructure in hpc -llvm'15, acm press, austin, tx, 2015, pp. 1-6, doi:10.1145/2833157.2833162, http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2833157.2833162.

"background: text messages are a feasible delivery channel for breastfeeding promotion, but only a few articles have examined their effectiveness.objective: to evaluate the impact of mobile phone text messages on breastfeeding practices.design: we implemented a 2-arm, parallel, individually randomized controlled trial with 353 pregnant participants at the central women's hospital, yangon. the intervention group (n = 179) received breastfeeding-promotion text messages, and the control group (n = 174) received other maternal and child health care messages. the primary outcome was the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 1-6 mo postpartum. secondary outcomes were other breast-feeding indicators, breastfeeding self-efficacy, and child morbidity. using the intention-to-treat approach, the available outcome data were analyzed with generalized estimation equation poisson regression models to estimate rr and 95% cis, adjusted for within-person correlation and time, and tested for treatment group-by-time interactions.results: exclusive breastfeeding prevalence was significantly higher in the intervention than in the control group for the 6 follow-up visits combined (rr: 1.48; 95%ci: 1.35, 1.63; p < 0.001) and at each monthly follow-up visit. at 6 mo, exclusive breastfeeding was 43.4% in the intervention compared with 15.3% in the control group (rr: 2.74; 95%ci: 1.79, 4.19; p < 0.001). also, at 6 mo, the intervention increased current breastfeeding (rr: 1.17; 95% ci: 1.07, 1.26; p < 0.001) and reduced bottle feeding (rr: 0.30; 95%ci: 0.17, 0.54; p < 0.001). exclusive breastfeeding was progressively higher in the intervention group than in the control group at each follow-up (p for interaction < 0.001) and similarly for current breastfeeding. the intervention increased the mean breastfeeding self-efficacy score (adjusted mean difference 4.0; 95%ci: 1.36, 6.64; p = 0.030). over the 6-month follow-up, the intervention significantly reduced diarrhea risk by 55% (rr: 0.45; 95%ci: 0.24, 0.82; p < 0.009).conclusions: regular, targeted text messages delivered to urban pregnant women and mothers via mobile phones significantly improve breastfeeding practices and reduce infant morbidity during the first 6 mo of life.trial registration: australian new zealand clinical trials registry actrn12615000063516; https://anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx? id=367704.",AB_0112
"gan inversion aims to invert a given image back into the latent space of a pretrained gan model so that the image can be faithfully reconstructed from the inverted code by the generator. as an emerging technique to bridge the real and fake image domains, gan inversion plays an essential role in enabling pretrained gan models, such as stylegan and biggan, for applications of real image editing. moreover, gan inversion interprets gan's latent space and examines how realistic images can be generated. in this paper, we provide a survey of gan inversion with a focus on its representative algorithms and its applications in image restoration and image manipulation. we further discuss the trends and challenges for future research. a curated list of gan inversion methods, datasets, and other related information can be found at https://github.com/weihaox/awesome-gan-inversion.",AB_0112
"the need for sensor fusion systems has grown, developing methods to find correspondences between images with different spectral ranges has become increasingly important. since most images do not share low-level information, such as textures and edges, existing matching approaches fail even with convolutional neural networks (cnns). in this paper, we propose an end-to-end metric learning method, called spimnet (spectral-invariant matching network) for robust cross- and multi-spectral image patch matching. while existing methods based on cnns learn matching features directly from cross- and multi-spectral image patches, spimnet transforms across spectral bands and discriminates for similarity in three steps. first, (1) spimnet is adjusted for a feature domain by introducing a domain translation network; then (2) two siamese networks learn to match the adjusted features with the same spectral domain; and (3) the matching features are fed to fully-connected layers to determine the identity of the patches as a classification task. by effectively incorporating each step, spimnet achieved competitive results on a variety of challenging datasets, including both vis-nir and vis-thermal image pairs. our code is available at https://github.com/koyeongmin/spimnet.",AB_0112
"in recent studies, pre-trained models and pseudo data have been key factors in improving the performance of the english grammatical error correction (gec) task. however, few studies have examined the role of pre-trained models and pseudo data in the chinese gec task. therefore, we develop chinese gec models based on three pre-trained models: chinese bert, chinese t5, and chinese bart, and then incorporate these models with pseudo data to determine the best configuration for the chinese gec task. on the natural language processing and chinese computing (nlpcc) 2018 gec shared task test set, all our single models outperform the ensemblemodels developed by the top team of the shared task. chinese bart achieves an f score of 37.15, which is a state-of-the-art result. we then combine our chinese gec models with three kinds of pseudo data: lang-8 (maskgec), wiki (maskgec), and wiki (backtranslation). we find that most models can benefit from pseudo data, and bart+lang-8 (maskgec) is the ideal setting in terms of accuracy and training efficiency. the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-trained models and pseudo data on the chinese gec task and provide an easily reproducible and adaptable baseline for future works. finally, we annotate the error types of the development data; the results show that word-level errors dominate all error types, and word selection errors must be addressed even when using pre-trained models and pseudo data. our codes are available at https://github.com/wang136906578/bert-encoder-chinesegec.",AB_0112
"metro origin-destination prediction is a crucial yet challenging time-series analysis task in intelligent transportation systems, which aims to accurately forecast two specific types of cross-station ridership, i.e., origin-destination (od) one and destination-origin (do) one. however, complete od matrices of previous time intervals can not be obtained immediately in online metro systems, and conventional methods only used limited information to forecast the future od and do ridership separately. in this work, we proposed a novel neural network module termed heterogeneous information aggregation machine (hiam), which fully exploits heterogeneous information of historical data (e.g., incomplete od matrices, unfinished order vectors, and do matrices) to jointly learn the evolutionary patterns of od and do ridership. specifically, an od modeling branch estimates the potential destinations of unfinished orders explicitly to complement the information of incomplete od matrices, while a do modeling branch takes do matrices as input to capture the spatial-temporal distribution of do ridership. moreover, a dual information transformer is introduced to propagate the mutual information among od features and do features for modeling the od-do causality and correlation. based on the proposed hiam, we develop a unified seq2seq network to forecast the future od and do ridership simultaneously. extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for online metro origin-destination prediction. our code is resealed at https://github.com/hcplab-sysu/hiam.",AB_0112
"recent deep face hallucination methods show stunning performance in super-resolving severely degraded facial images, even surpassing human ability. however, these algorithms are mainly evaluated on non-public synthetic datasets. it is thus unclear how these algorithms perform on public face hallucination datasets. meanwhile, most of the existing datasets do not well consider the distribution of races, which makes face hallucination methods trained on these datasets biased toward some specific races. to address the above two problems, in this paper, we build a public ethnically diverse face dataset, edface-celeb-1 m, and design a benchmark task for face hallucination. our dataset includes 1.7 million photos that cover different countries, with relatively balanced race composition. to the best of our knowledge, it is the largest-scale and publicly available face hallucination dataset in the wild. associated with this dataset, this paper also contributes various evaluation protocols and provides comprehensive analysis to benchmark the existing state-of-the-art methods. the benchmark evaluations demonstrate the performance and limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms. https://github.com/hdcvlab/edface-celeb-1m.",AB_0112
"the trilobite needmorella new genus, with type species n. simoni new genus new species from the late emsian to mid-eifelian needmore shale of west virginia, is a distinctive member of the subfamily synphoriinae. it also occurs in the same formation in pennsylvania and virginia. it is not very similar to other devonian representatives of the subfamily and is considered to have its origins in a morphologically less-derived ancestor because it shares certain similarities with silurian genera, including the very short anterior cephalic border unmodified by crenulations or spines, s2 that is not largely reduced to a deep pit adaxially, the relatively low inflation of l3, and the well-defined interpleural furrows on the pygidium. other particularly distinctive characters of the genus include the very long genal spines and the abaxially inflated and expanded posterior pleural bands on the thorax and pygidium that project slightly distally. the conventional concept of the devonian synphoriine anchiopsis delo, 1935 appears to be incompatible with the holotype of the type species, judging from the early illustrations of the specimen, and the genus could be a synonym of synphoria clarke, 1894. uuid: http://zoobank.org/4a820e27-54ec-4f7b-a408-675e62b75154",AB_0112
"phased dna methylation states within bisulfite sequencing reads are valuable source of information that can be used to estimate epigenetic diversity across cells as well as epigenomic instability in individual cells. various measures capturing the heterogeneity of dna methylation states have been proposed for a decade. however, in routine analyses on dna methylation, this heterogeneity is often ignored by computing average methylation levels at cpg sites, even though such information exists in bisulfite sequencing data in the form of phased methylation states, or methylation patterns. in this study, to facilitate the application of the dna methylation heterogeneity measures in downstream epigenomic analyses, we present a rust-based, extremely fast and lightweight bioinformatics toolkit called metheor. as the analysis of dna methylation heterogeneity requires the examination of pairs or groups of cpgs throughout the genome, existing softwares suffer from high computational burden, which almost make a large-scale dna methylation heterogeneity studies intractable for researchers with limited resources. in this study, we benchmark the performance of metheor against existing code implementations for dna methylation heterogeneity measures in three different scenarios of simulated bisulfite sequencing datasets. metheor was shown to dramatically reduce the execution time up to 300-fold and memory footprint up to 60-fold, while producing identical results with the original implementation, thereby facilitating a large-scale study of dna methylation heterogeneity profiles. to demonstrate the utility of the low computational burden of metheor, we show that the methylation heterogeneity profiles of 928 cancer cell lines can be computed with standard computing resources. with those profiles, we reveal the association between dna methylation heterogeneity and various omics features. source code for metheor is at https://github.com/dohlee/metheor and is freely available under the gpl-3.0 license.",AB_0112
"study objectives: to assess the association between psychotropic medications and sleep microstructure in large community-based cohorts of older people.methods: we analyzed overnight polysomnograms of 381 women from the study of osteoporotic fractures (sof) and 2,657 men from the osteoporotic fractures in men sleep study (mros), who either used no psychotropic medication (n = 2,819), only benzodiazepines (n = 112), or only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssri) (n = 107). sleep microstructure (cyclic alternating pattern, cap) was compared between the no medication group and psychotropic medication groups using the mann-whitney u test. significant differences were investigated using multivariable linear regression adjusted for confounders.results: cap rate, arousal index, apnea-hypopnea index, and the frequency of slow, low-amplitude electroencephalography activation phases were significantly lower in mros participants using benzodiazepines than participants not taking psychotropic medication. ssri users in mros experienced no altered sleep microstructure compared to those with no psychotropic use. sof participants using benzodiazepines did not show similar associations with sleep microstructure. however, ssri users from sof had a significantly higher frequency of rapid, high-amplitude electroencephalography activation phases (a2 + 3) and periodic limb-movement index than participants not taking psychotropic medication. multivariable linear regression adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, mood disorders, and health variables indicated additional significant associations between benzodiazepine usage and cap rate and a2 + 3 index, respectively, in older men, and between cap rate and ssri usage in older women.conclusions: we identified significant associations between sleep microstructure and psychotropic drugs in mros and sof, highlighting the importance of comprehensive sleep analysis, including cap. our results may improve understanding of the differences in sleep-wake mechanisms based on psychotropic usage.clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; title: outcomes of sleep disorders in older men; identifier: nct00070681; url: https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/record/nct00070681.",AB_0112
