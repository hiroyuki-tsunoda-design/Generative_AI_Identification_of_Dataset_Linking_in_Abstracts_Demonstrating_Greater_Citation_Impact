"background: stroke survivors are at significantly increased risk of cognitive impairment, which affects patients' independence of activities of daily living (adls), social engagement, and neurological function deficit. many studies have been done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of post-stroke cognitive impairment (psci) treatment, and due to the largely inconsistent clinical data, there is a need to summarize and analyze the published clinical research data in this area.objective: an umbrella review was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psci therapies.methods: three independent authors searched for meta-analyses and systematic reviews on pubmed, the cochrane library, and the web of science to address this issue. we examined adl and barthel index (bi), montreal cognitive assessment (moca), neurological function deficit as efficacy endpoints, and the incidence of adverse events as safety profiles.results: in all, 312 studies from 19 eligible publications were included in the umbrella review. the results showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (acei) and n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonists, cell therapies, acupuncture, and egb76 can improve the moca and adl, and the adverse effects were mild for the treatment of psci. moreover, vinpocetine, oxiracetam, citicoline, thrombolytic therapy, actovegin, dl-3-n-butylphthalide, and nimodipine showed adverse events or low article quality in patients with psci. however, the research evidence is not exact and further research is needed.conclusion: our study demonstrated that acei inhibitors (donepezil) and nmda antagonists (memantine), egb761, and acupuncture are the adl and bi, moca, and neurological function deficit medication/therapy, respectively, for patients with psci.clinical trial registration: https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-11-0139/; identifier: inplasy2022110139.",AB_0310
"background the natural products, metabolites, of gut microbes are crucial effect factors on diseases. comprehensive identification and annotation of relationships among disease, metabolites, and microbes can provide efficient and targeted solutions towards understanding the mechanism of complex disease and development of new markers and drugs. results we developed gut microbial metabolite association with disease (gmmad), a manually curated database of associations among human diseases, gut microbes, and metabolites of gut microbes. here, this initial release (i) contains 3,836 disease-microbe associations and 879,263 microbe-metabolite associations, which were extracted from literatures and available resources and then experienced our manual curation; (ii) defines an association strength score and a confidence score. with these two scores, gmmad predicted 220,690 disease-metabolite associations, where the metabolites all belong to the gut microbes. we think that the positive effective (with both scores higher than suggested thresholds) associations will help identify disease marker and understand the pathogenic mechanism from the sense of gut microbes. the negative effective associations would be taken as biomarkers and have the potential as drug candidates. literature proofs supported our proposal with experimental consistence; (iii) provides a user-friendly web interface that allows users to browse, search, and download information on associations among diseases, metabolites, and microbes. the resource is freely available at http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/gmmad. conclusions as the online-available unique resource for gut microbial metabolite-disease associations, gmmad is helpful for researchers to explore mechanisms of disease- metabolite-microbe and screen the drug and marker candidates for different diseases.",AB_0310
"objectives: aficamten is a selective, small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of cardiac sarcomere being developed as a chronic oral treatment for patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. this was the first-in-chinese study aiming to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of aficamten in healthy adults.methods: this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study was conducted in 28 healthy male and female chinese participants after single ascending dose (sad) and multi-dose (md) administrations of aficamten. in the sad cohort, 16 participants were randomized to receive a single oral dose of aficamten: 10 mg, 20 mg, or placebo. in the md cohort, 12 participants were randomized to receive multiple doses of aficamten: 5 mg or placebo once daily for 14 days. safety was monitored throughout the study with electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests, and reporting of adverse events (aes). pharmacokinetic profiles of aficamten and metabolites, as well as cyp2d6 genetic impact, were evaluated.results: a total of 35 treatment-emergent aes were reported by 14 (50%) participants with mild severity. there were no serious aes or adverse decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction below 50% during the study. aficamten was dose-proportional over the dose range of 5-20 mg and accumulated in the md cohort.conclusion: aficamten was safe and well-tolerated in the healthy chinese adult participants. the pharmacokinetics of aficamten in the chinese population was comparable to those previously found in western participants. these phase 1 data support the progression of aficamten into future clinical studies in chinese patients.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: nct04783766.",AB_0310
"the leading-edge crispr/crispr-associated technology is revolutionizing biotechnologies through genome editing. to track on/off-target events with emerging new editing techniques, improved bioinformatic tools are indispensable. existing tools suffer from limitations in speed and scalability, especially with whole-genome sequencing (wgs) data analysis. to address these limitations, we have developed a comprehensive tool called crispr-detector, a web-based and locally deployable pipeline for genome editing sequence analysis. the core analysis module of crispr-detector is based on the sentieon tnscope pipeline, with additional novel annotation and visualization modules designed to fit crispr applications. co-analysis of the treated and control samples is performed to remove existing background variants prior to genome editing. crispr-detector offers optimized scalability, enabling wgs data analysis beyond browser extensible data file-defined regions, with improved accuracy due to haplotype-based variant calling to handle sequencing errors. in addition, the tool also provides integrated structural variation calling and includes functional and clinical annotations of editing-induced mutations appreciated by users. these advantages facilitate rapid and efficient detection of mutations induced by genome editing events, especially for datasets generated from wgs. the web-based version of crispr-detector is available at https://db.cngb.org/crispr-detector, and the locally deployable version is available at https://github.com/hlcas/crispr-detector. copyright (c) 2023, the authors. institute of genetics and developmental biology, chinese academy of sciences, and genetics society of china. published by elsevier limited and science press. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0310
"local causal structure learning (lcsl) is the process of discovering and distinguishing direct causes (parents) and direct effects (children) of a given target variable (t) without learning a global causal structure. however, state-of-the-art lcsl algorithms can only address static feature space, while ignoring the dynamic changes of feature space with streaming features. for high dimensional data, existing methods fail to efficiently distinguish causality between features and the target variable. to address these issues, we propose local causal structure learning for streaming features (lcslsf). lcslsf comprises two sequential steps, as it first dynamically mines causal features to construct an approximate markov blanket (amb) of the target variable. it proceeds by filtering irrelevant and redundant features, retaining causal features as much as possible from streaming features. second, it learns local causal structures by mining and splicing the v-structure of feature nodes in batches from amb of the target variable. on benchmark bayesian networks with the number of variables ranging from 20 to 724, lcslsf achieves a significantly better performance than its rivals. we demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting a real-world case study on causal discovery in medical diagnostics. code is released at https:// github .com /youdianlong /lcslsf.",AB_0310
"multiple kernel clustering (mkc) has garnered considerable attention in recent years, aiming to obtain an optimal partition from multiple base kernels. existing mkc methods typically focus on either learning the pairwise structure by constructing an optimal kernel from the base kernels or learning the cluster structure by integrating multiple base partitions into a consensus one for clustering. however, these previous approaches overlook the potential for mutual structure learning between the two aspects, i.e., pairwise and cluster structure, of clustering. to address this limitation, we propose a novel multiple kernel clustering method, referred to as msl-mkc, which simultaneously learns pairwise and cluster structure to achieve an improved consensus partition matrix for clustering. specifically, msl-mkc extends the adaptive neighbor graph learning approach into kernel space to construct a discriminative similarity graph from multiple base kernels for pairwise structure learning. the consensus partition is formulated by aligning it with multiple base partitions for cluster structure learning. we utilize a laplacian regularization term to preserve the pairwise structure in the consensus partition and inject the cluster structure into the discriminative similarity graph. the proposed method integrates similarity graph learning, partition fusion, and laplacian regularization into a unified framework, optimized using an iterative algorithm. experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of msl-mkc. the demo code of this work is publicly available at https:// github .com /guanyuezhen /msl-mkc.",AB_0310
"introduction: previous studies indicated that wuda granule (wdg) has been applied in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorder (gmd), but the effect and underlying mechanisms is yet to be elucidated. this study aimed to explore the mechanism and pharmacological effect of wdg for gmd via network analysis, verification of animal experiments and clinical experiments.methods: the chemical components of wdg were identified from the traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology database (tcmsp, http://lsp.nwu.edu.cn/index.php), and the encyclopedia of traditional chinese medicine (etcm, http://www.tcmip.cn/etcm/index.php/home/index/) according to oral bioavailability (ob) & ge; 20% and drug-likeness (dl) & ge; 0.10. the targets of wdg compounds were retrieved from the swiss target prediction database (http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/) and targets related to gmd were retrieved from genecards database (https://www.genecards.org/). network analysis were performed to screen the key active compounds of wdg and its hub targets. then the pharmacological effect of wdg were verified via vivo experiments in rats and clinical experiments.results: the results showed that 117 effective active compounds of wdg were screened and 494 targets of wdg compounds targeting gmd were selected. these targets were involved in the biological process of inflammatory regulation and the regulation of gastrointestinal motility. the mechanism was mainly involved in the regulation of pi3k-akt signaling pathway and rap1 signaling pathway. in addition, molecular docking analysis suggested that eight key active compounds of wdg may be mainly responsible for the effect of wdg on gmd by targeting hars, akt, and pik3ca, respectively. animal experiments and clinical trials both suggested that wdg could exert therapeutical effect on gmd via inhibiting inflammation and promoting gastrointestinal motility, it could also improve digestive function of patients with laparoscopic colorectal cancer after surgery.conclusion: this study was the first to demonstrate that wdg improved gmd mainly via inhibiting inflammatory level and promoting gastrointestinal motility, providing new insights for the understanding of wdg for gmd, inspiration for future research and reference for clinical strategy in terms of the treatment of gmd.",AB_0310
"the status of hormone receptors (hr) at the molecular level is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of breast cancer. meanwhile, mammography is an effective screening method for detecting breast cancer, which significantly improve survival. however, diagnosing the molecular status of breast cancer involves a pathological biopsy, which can affect the accuracy of the diagnosis. to non-invasively diagnose the hormone receptor (hr) status of breast cancer and reduced manual annotation, we proposed a weakly supervised deep learning framework bsnet which detected breast cancer with hr status and benign tumors. bsnet was trained on 2321 multi-view mammography cases from female undergoing digital mammography for the general population at harbin medical university cancer hospital in heilongjiang province during the period 2017-2018 and was validated on the external cohort. the average aucs of bsnet on the test set and the external validation set were 0.89 and 0.92, respectively. bsnet demonstrated excellent performance in non-invasive breast cancer diagnosis with hr status, using multiple mammography views without pixel annotation. furthermore, we developed a web server (http://bsnet.edbc.org) for easy use. bsnet described high-dimensional mammography of breast cancer subtypes, which helped inform early management options.",AB_0310
"in the transfer-based adversarial attacks, adversarial examples are only generated by the surrogate models and achieve effective perturbation in the victim models. although considerable efforts have been developed on improving the transferability of adversarial examples generated by transfer-based adversarial attacks, our investigation found that, the big convergence speed deviation along the actual and steepest update directions of the current transfer-based adversarial attacks is caused by the large update step length, resulting in the generated adversarial examples can not converge well. however, directly reducing the update step length will lead to serious update oscillation so that the generated adversarial examples also can not achieve great transferability to the victim models. to address these issues, a novel transfer-based attack, namely direction tuning attack, is proposed to not only decrease the angle between the actual and steepest update directions in the large step length, but also mitigate the update oscillation in the small sampling step length, thereby making the generated adversarial examples converge well to achieve great transferability on victim models. specifically, in our direction tuning attack, we first update the adversarial examples using the large step length, which is aligned with the previous transfer-based attacks. in addition, in each large step length of the update, multiple examples sampled by using a small step length. the average gradient of these sampled examples is then used to reduce the angle between the actual and steepest update directions, as well as mitigates the update oscillation by eliminating the oscillating component. by doing so, our direction tuning attack can achieve better convergence and enhance the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. in addition, a network pruning method is proposed to smooth the decision boundary, thereby further decreasing the update oscillation and enhancing the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. the experiment results on imagenet demonstrate that the average attack success rate (asr) of the adversarial examples generated by our method can be improved from 87.9% to 94.5% on five victim models without defenses, and from 69.1% to 76.2% on eight advanced defense methods, in comparison with that of latest gradient-based attacks. code is available at https://github .com /halomoto /directiontuningattack.",AB_0310
"manipulator teams are frequently employed in various industrial applications to handle challenging cooperative tasks. the complicated interaction between manipulators makes it difficult to design applications from scratch. although robotics middleware has emerged as the key to lowering the development complexity of manipulator applications, existing works still have limitations in controlling multiple manipulators to carry out tasks cooperatively. to overcome the limitations, middleware should provide programming abstraction support, coordination mechanism, and dynamic reconfiguration of motion controllers so that a team of manipulators can work together efficiently. this work proposes maniware, an easy-to-use middleware that provides the team-level programming abstraction and the manipulator-level plugin mechanism for programming and configuring manipulator applications. the team-level programming abstraction can facilitate the development process by invoking the functions from the fundamental cooperation components, which drives the developers to focus on designing application logic. besides, the plugin mechanism dynamically configures and manages the motion controller of different parts of manipulators, making the reconfiguration feasible. this work implements maniware and evaluates the task execution performance with three case studies in the high-fidelity simulation platform. the experimental results demonstrate that maniware facilitates cooperative tasks with a high success rate, efficient completion time, and marginal runtime overhead. the source code is at https://github.com/sundycoder/maniware.",AB_0310
