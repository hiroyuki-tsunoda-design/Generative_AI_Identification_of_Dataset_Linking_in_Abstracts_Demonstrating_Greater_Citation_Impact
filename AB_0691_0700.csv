"safety is a critical component of autonomous systems and remains a challenge for learning-based policies to be utilized in the real world. in particular, policies learned using reinforcement learning often fail to generalize to novel environments due to unsafe behavior. in this paper, we propose sim-to-lab-to-real to bridge the reality gap with a probabilistically guaranteed safety-aware policy distribution. to improve safety, we apply a dual policy setup where a performance policy is trained using the cumulative task reward and a backup (safety) policy is trained by solving the safety bellman equation based on hamilton-jacobi (hj) reachability analysis. in sim-to-lab transfer, we apply a supervisory control scheme to shield unsafe actions during exploration; in lab-to-real transfer, we leverage the probably approximately correct (pac)-bayes framework to provide lower bounds on the expected performance and safety of policies in unseen environments. additionally, inheriting from the hj reachability analysis, the bound accounts for the expectation over the worst-case safety in each environment. we empirically study the proposed framework for ego-vision navigation in two types of indoor environments with varying degrees of photorealism. we also demonstrate strong generalization performance through hardware experiments in real indoor spaces with a quadrupedal robot. see https:// sites .google .com /princeton .edu /sim-to -lab-to-real for supplementary material.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0070
"multi-object tracking (mot) systems often rely on accurate object detectors; however, accurate detectors are not available in every application domain. we present robust confidence tracking (rct), an offline mot algorithm designed for settings where detection quality is poor. whereas prior methods simply threshold and discard detection confidence information, rct relies on the exact detection confidence values to increase track quality throughout the entire tracking pipeline. this innovation (along with some simple and well-studied heuristics) allows rct to achieve robust performance with minimal identity switches, even when provided with completely unfiltered detections. to compare trackers in the presence of unreliable detections, we present a challenging real-world underwater fish tracking dataset, fishtrac. in an large-scale evaluation across fishtrac, ua-detrac, and motchallenge data, rct outperforms a wide variety of trackers, including deep trackers and more classic approaches. we have publically released our fishtrac codebase and training dataset at https://github.com/tmandel/fish-detrac , which will facilitate comparing trackers on understudied problems.(c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license (  )",AB_0070
"the mouse phenome database (mpd; https://phenome.jax.org; rrid:scr_003212), supported by the us national institutes of health, is a biomedical data repository listed in the trans-nih biomedical informatics coordinating committee registry. as an increasingly fair-compliant and trust-worthy data repository, mpd accepts phenotype and genotype data from mouse experiments and curates, organizes, integrates, archives, and distributes those data using community standards. data are accompanied by rich metadata, including widely used ontologies and detailed protocols. data are from all over the world and represent genetic, behavioral, morphological, and physiological disease-related characteristics in mice at baseline or those exposed to drugs or other treatments. mpd houses data from over 6000 strains and populations, representing many reproducible strain types and heterogenous populations such as the diversity outbred where each mouse is unique but can be genotyped throughout the genome. a suite of analysis tools is available to aggregate, visualize, and analyze these data within and across studies and populations in an increasingly traceable and reproducible manner. we have refined existing resources and developed new tools to continue to provide users with access to consistent, high-quality data that has translational relevance in a modernized infrastructure that enables interaction with a suite of bioinformatics analytic and data services.",AB_0070
"the genomes online database (gold) (https:// gold.jgi.doe.gov/) at the department of energy joint genome institute (doe-jgi) continues to maintain its role as one of the flagship genomic metadata repositories of the world. the ever-increasing number of projects and metadata are freely available to the user community world-wide. gold's metadata is consumed by scientists and remains an important source for large-scale comparative genomics analysis initiatives. encouraged by this active user engagement and growth, gold has continued to add new components and capabilities. the new features such as a public application programming interface (api) and ecosystem landing page as well as the growth of different entities in this current gold v.9 edition are described in detail in this manuscript.",AB_0070
"genomic knowledgebase (genomickb) is a graph database for researchers to explore and investigate human genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and 4d nucleome with simple and efficient queries. the database uses a knowledge graph to consolidate genomic datasets and annotations from over 30 consortia and portals, including 347 million genomic entities, 1.36 billion relations, and 3.9 billion entity and relation properties. genomickb is equipped with a web-based query system (https:// gkb.dcmb.med. umich.edu/) which allows users to query the knowledge graph with customized graph patterns and specific constraints on entities and relations. compared with traditional tabular-structured data stored in separate data portals, genomickb emphasizes the relations among genomic entities, intuitively connects isolated data matrices, and supports efficient queries for scientific discoveries. genomickb transforms complicated analysis among multiple genomic entities and relations into coding-free queries, and facilitates data-driven genomic discoveries in the future.",AB_0070
"pubchem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a popular chemical information resource that serves a wide range of use cases. in the past two years, a number of changes were made to pubchem. data from more than 120 data sources was added to pubchem. some major highlights include: the integration of google patents data into pubchem, which greatly expanded the coverage of the pubchem patent data collection; the creation of the cell line and taxonomy data collections, which provide quick and easy access to chemical information for a given cell line and taxon, respectively; and the update of the bioassay data model. in addition, new functionalities were added to the pubchem programmatic access protocols, pug-rest and pug-view, including support for target-centric data download for a given protein, gene, pathway, cell line, and taxon and the addition of the 'standardize' option to pug-rest, which returns the standardized form of an input chemical structure. a significant update was also made to pub-chemrdf. the present paper provides an overview of these changes.",AB_0070
"proteins often act through oligomeric interactions with other proteins. x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy provide detailed information on the structures of biological assemblies, defined as the most likely biologically relevant structures derived from experimental data. in crystal structures, the most relevant assembly may be ambiguously determined, since multiple assemblies observed in the crystal lattice may be plausible. it is estimated that 10-15% of pdb entries may have incorrect or ambiguous assembly annotations. accurate assemblies are required for understanding functional data and training of deep learning methods for predicting assembly structures. as with any other kind of biological data, replication via multiple independent experiments provides important validation for the determination of biological assembly structures. here we present the protein common assembly database protcad), which presents clusters of protein assembly structures observed in independent structure determinations of homologous proteins in the protein data bank (pdb). protcad is searchable by pdb entry, uniprot identifiers, or pfam domain designations and provides downloads of coordinate files, pymol scripts, and publicly available assembly annotations for each cluster of assemblies. about 60% of pdb entries contain assemblies in clusters of at least 2 independent experiments. all clusters and coordinates are available on protcad web site (http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/protcad).",AB_0070
"in mammals, transcriptional factors (tfs) drive gene expression by binding to regulatory elements in a cooperative manner. deciphering the rules of such cooperation is crucial to obtain a full understanding of cellular homeostasis and development. although this is a long-standing topic, there is no comprehensive database for biologists to access the syntax of tf binding sites. here we present tfsyntax (https://tfsyntax.zhaopage.com), a database focusing on the arrangement of tf binding sites. tfsyntax maps the binding motif of 1299 human tfs and 890 mouse tfs across 382 cells and tissues, representing the most comprehensive tf binding map to date. in addition to location, tfsyntax defines motif positional preference, density and colocalization within accessible elements. powered by a series of functional modules based on web interface, users can freely search, browse, analyze, and download data of interest. with comprehensive characterization of tf binding syntax across distinct tissues and cell types, tfsyntax represents a valuable resource and platform for studying the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and exploring how regulatory dna variants cause disease.",AB_0070
"aliasing refers to the phenomenon that high frequency signals degenerate into completely different ones after sampling. it arises as a problem in the context of deep learning as downsampling layers are widely adopted in deep architectures to reduce parameters and computation. the standard solution is to apply a low-pass filter (e.g., gaussian blur) before downsampling (zhang in: icml, 2020). however, it can be suboptimal to apply the same filter across the entire content, as the frequency of feature maps can vary across both spatial locations and feature channels. to tackle this, we propose an adaptive content-aware low-pass filtering layer, which predicts separate filter weights for each spatial location and channel group of the input feature maps. we investigate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method across multiple tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and image-to-image translation. both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our approach effectively adapts to the different feature frequencies to avoid aliasing while preserving useful information for recognition. code is available at https://maureenzou.github.io/ddac/.",AB_0070
"the comparative toxicogenomics database (ctd; http://ctdbase.org/) harmonizes cross-species heterogeneous data for chemical exposures and their biological repercussions by manually curating and interrelating chemical, gene, phenotype, anatomy, disease, taxa, and exposure content from the published literature. this curated information is integrated to generate inferences, providing potential molecular mediators to develop testable hypotheses and fill in knowledge gaps for environmental health. this dual nature, acting as both a knowledge-base and a discovery-base, makes ctd a unique resource for the scientific community. here, we report a 20% increase in overall ctd content for 17 100 chemicals, 54 300 genes, 6100 phenotypes, 7270 diseases and 202 000 exposure statements. we also present ctd tetramers, a novel tool that computationally generates four-unit information blocks connecting a chemical, gene, phenotype, and disease to construct potential molecular mechanistic pathways. finally, we integrate terms for human biological media used in the ctd exposure module to corresponding ctd anatomy pages, allowing users to survey the chemical profiles for any tissue-of-interest and see how these environmental biomarkers are related to phenotypes for any anatomical site. these, and other webpage visual enhancements, continue to promote ctd as a practical, user-friendly, and innovative resource for finding information and generating testable hypotheses about environmental health.",AB_0070
