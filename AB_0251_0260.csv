"the time since deposition (tsd) of a bloodstain, i.e., the time of a bloodstain formation is an essential piece of biological evidence in crime scene investigation. the practical usage of some existing microscopic methods (e.g., spectroscopy or rna analysis technology) is limited, as their performance strongly relies on high -end instrumentation and/or rigorous laboratory conditions. this paper presents a practically applicable deep learning -based method (i.e., bloodnet) for efficient, accurate, and costless tsd inference from a macroscopic view, i.e., by using easily accessible bloodstain photos. to this end, we established a benchmark database containing around 50,000 photos of bloodstains with varying tsds. capitalizing on such a large-scale database, bloodnet adopted attention mechanisms to learn from relatively high -resolution input images the localized fine-grained feature representations that were highly discriminative between different tsd periods. also, the visual analysis of the learned deep networks based on the smooth grad -cam tool demonstrated that our bloodnet can stably capture the unique local patterns of bloodstains with specific tsds, suggesting the efficacy of the utilized attention mechanism in learning fine-grained representations for tsd inference. as a paired study for bloodnet, we further conducted a microscopic analysis using raman spectroscopic data and a machine learning method based on bayesian optimization. although the experimental results show that such a new microscopic -level approach outperformed the state-of-the-art by a large margin, its inference accuracy is significantly lower than bloodnet, which further justifies the efficacy of deep learning techniques in the challenging task of bloodstain tsd inference. our code is publically accessible via https://github.com/shenxiaochenraloodnet. our datasets and pre -trained models can be freely accessed via https://figshare.comtarticlesidataset/21291825.",AB_0026
"emerging evidence has proved that circular rnas (circrnas) are implicated in pathogenic processes. they are regarded as promising biomarkers for diagnosis due to covalently closed loop structures. as opposed to traditional experiments, computational approaches can identify circrna-disease associations at a lower cost. aggregating multi -source pathogenesis data helps to alleviate data sparsity and infer potential associations at the system level. the majority of computational approaches construct a homologous network using multi-source data, but they lose the heterogeneity of the data. effective methods that use the features of multi -source data are considered as a matter of urgency. in this paper, we propose a model (cdhgnn) based on edge -weighted graph attention and heterogeneous graph neural networks for potential circrna-disease association prediction. the circrna network, micro rna network, disease network and heterogeneous network are constructed based on multi -source data. to reflect association probabilities between nodes, an edge-weighted graph attention network model is designed for node features. to assign attention weights to different types of edges and learn contextual meta-path, cdhgnn infers potential circrna-disease association based on heterogeneous neural networks. cdhgnn outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy. edge -weighted graph attention networks and heterogeneous graph networks have both improved performance significantly. furthermore, case studies suggest that cdhgnn is capable of identifying specific molecular associations and investigating biomolecular regulatory relationships in pathogenesis. the code of cdhgnn is freely available at https://github.com/bioinformaticscsu/cdhgnn.",AB_0026
"heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a2/b1 (hnrnp a2/b1) has been identified as a nuclear dna sensor. upon viral infection, hnrnp a2/b1 recognizes pathogen-derived dna as a homodimer, which is a prerequisite for its translocation to the cytoplasm to activate the interferon response. however, the dna binding mechanism inducing hnrnp a2/b1 homodimerization is unknown. here, we show the crys-tal structure of the rna recognition motif (rrm) of hnrnp a2/b1 in complex with a u-shaped ssdna, which mediates the formation of a newly observed protein dimer. our biochemical assays and mutagen-esis studies confirm that the hnrnp a2/b1 homodimer forms in solution by binding to pre-generated ssdna or dsdna with a u-shaped bulge. these results depict a potential functional state of hnrnp a2/b1 in antiviral immunity and other cellular processes.(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://crea-tivecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0026
"cancer initiation and progression are likely caused by the dysregulation of biological pathways. gene set analysis (gsa) could improve the signal-to-noise ratio and identify potential biological insights on the gene set level. however, platforms exploring cancer multiomics data using gsa methods are lacking. in this study, we upgraded our gscalite to gsca (gene set cancer analysis, http://bioinfo. life.hustedu.cn(gsca) for cancer gsa at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels. in this improved gsca, we integrated expression, mutation, drug sensitivity and clinical data from four public data sources for 33 cancer types. we introduced useful features to gsca, including associations between immune infiltration with gene expression and genomic variations, and associations between gene set expression/mutation and clinical outcomes. gsca has four main functional modules for cancer gsa to explore, analyze and visualize expression, genomic variations, tumor immune infiltration, drug sensitivity and their associations with clinical outcomes. we used case studies of three gene sets: (i) seven cell cycle genes, (ii) tumor suppressor genes of pi3k pathway and (iii) oncogenes of pi3k pathway to prove the advantage of gsca over single gene analysis. we found novel associations of gene set expression and mutation with clinical outcomes in different cancer types on gene set level, while on single gene analysis level, they are not significant associations. in conclusion, gsca is a user-friendly web server and a useful resource for conducting hypothesis tests by using gsa methods at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels.",AB_0026
"discovering the relationships between long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) and diseases is significant in the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of diseases. however, current identified lncrna-disease associations are not enough because of the expensive and heavy workload of wet laboratory experiments. therefore, it is greatly important to develop an efficient computational method for predicting potential lncrna-disease associations. previous methods showed that combining the prediction results of the lncrnadisease associations predicted by different classification methods via learning to rank (ltr) algorithm can be effective for predicting potential lncrna-disease associations. however, when the classification results are incorrect, the ranking results will inevitably be affected. we propose the graltr-lda predictor based on biological knowledge graphs and ranking framework for predicting potential lncrna-disease associations. firstly, homogeneous graph and heterogeneous graph are constructed by integrating multi source biological information. then, graltr-lda integrates graph auto-encoder and attention mechanism to extract embedded features from the constructed graphs. finally, graltr-lda incorporates the embedded features into the ltr via feature crossing statistical strategies to predict priority order of diseases associated with query lncrnas. experimental results demonstrate that graltr-lda outperforms the other state-of-the-art predictors and can effectively detect potential lncrna-disease associations. availability and implementation: datasets and source codes are available at http://bliulab.net/graltr-lda.",AB_0026
"the subcellular localization of long non -coding rnas (lncrnas) is crucial for understanding 1ncrna functions. most of existing 1ncrna subcellular localization prediction methods use k-mer frequency features to encode 1ncrna sequences. however, k-mer frequency features lose sequence order information and fail to capture sequence patterns and motifs of different lengths. in this paper, we proposed graphlncloc, a graph convolutional network -based deep learning model, for predicting 1ncrna subcellular localization. unlike previous studies encoding 1ncrna sequences by using k-mer frequency features, graphlncloc transforms 1ncrna sequences into de bruijn graphs, which transforms the sequence classification problem into a graph classification problem. to extract the high-level features from the de bruijn graph, graphlncloc employs graph convolutional networks to learn latent representations. then, the high-level feature vectors derived from de bruijn graph are fed into a fully connected layer to perform the prediction task. extensive experiments show that graphlncloc achieves better performance than traditional machine learning models and existing predictors. in addition, our analyses show that transforming sequences into graphs has more distinguishable features and is more robust than k-mer frequency features. the case study shows that graphlncloc can uncover important motifs for nucleus subcellular localization. graphlncloc web server is available at http://csuligroup.com:8000/graphlncloct.",AB_0026
"drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery and has been studied for decades. most methods follow the canonical paradigm that processes the inputs of the protein (target) and the ligand (drug) separately and then combines them together. in this study we demonstrate, surprisingly, that a model is able to achieve even superior performance without access to any protein-sequence -related information. instead, a protein is characterized completely by the ligands that it interacts. specifically, we treat different proteins separately, which are jointly trained in a multi -head manner, so as to learn a robust and universal representation of ligands that is generalizable across proteins. empirical evidences show that the novel paradigm outperforms its competitive sequence -based counterpart, with the mean squared error (mse) of 0.4261 versus 0.7612 and the r -square of 0.7984 versus 0.6570 compared with deepaffinity. we also investigate the transfer learning scenario where unseen proteins are encountered after the initial training, and the cross-dataset evaluation for prospective studies. the results reveals the robustness of the proposed model in generalizing to unseen proteins as well as in predicting future data. source codes and data are available at https://github.com/huzqatpku/sam-dta.",AB_0026
"motivation: exploring the potential long noncoding rna (lncrna)-disease associations (ldas) plays a critical role for understanding disease etiology and pathogenesis. given the high cost of biological experiments, developing a computational method is a practical necessity to effectively accelerate experimental screening process of candidate ldas. however, under the high sparsity of lda dataset, many computational models hardly exploit enough knowledge to learn comprehensive patterns of node representations. moreover, although the metapath-based gnn has been recently introduced into lda prediction, it discards intermediate nodes along the meta path and results in information loss. results: this paper presents a new multi -view contrastive heterogeneous graph attention network (gat) for lncrna-disease association prediction, mchnlda for brevity. specifically, mchnlda firstly leverages rich biological data sources of lncrna, gene and disease to construct two -view graphs, feature structural graph of feature schema view and lncrna-genedisease heterogeneous graph of network topology view. then, we design a cross -contrastive learning task to collaboratively guide graph embeddings of the two views without relying on any labels. in this way, we can pull closer the nodes of similar features and network topology, and push other nodes away. furthermore, we propose a heterogeneous contextual gat, where long short-term memory network is incorporated into attention mechanism to effectively capture sequential structure information along the meta path. extensive experimental comparisons against several state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of proposed framework.the code and data of proposed framework is freely available at https://github.com/zhaoxs686/mchnlda.",AB_0026
"membrane-based cells are the fundamental structural and functional units of organisms, while evidences demonstrate that liquidliquid phase separation (llps) is associated with the formation of membraneless organelles, such as p -bodies, nucleoli and stress granules. many studies have been undertaken to explore the functions of protein phase separation (ps), but these studies lacked an effective tool to identify the sequence segments that critical for llps. in this study, we presented a novel software called dscope (http://dscope.omicsbiainfo) to predict the ps -driving regions. to develop the predictor, we curated experimentally identified sequence segments that can drive llps from published literature. then sliding sequence window based physiological, biochemical, structural and coding features were integrated by random forest algorithm to perform prediction. through rigorous evaluation, dscope was demonstrated to achieve satisfactory performance. furthermore, large-scale analysis of human proteome based on dscope showed that the predicted ps -driving regions enriched various protein post -translational modifications and cancer mutations, and the proteins which contain predicted ps -driving regions enriched critical cellular signaling pathways. taken together, dscope precisely predicted the protein sequence segments critical for llps, with various helpful information visualized in the webserver to facilitate llps-related research.",AB_0026
"poliovirus (pv) is an infectious virus that causes poliomyelitis, which seriously threatens the health of children. the release of viral rna is a key step of pv in host cell infection, and multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that rna release is initiated by the opening of the twofold channels of the pv capsid. however, the mechanism that controls the twofold channel opening is still not well understood. in addition, the channel opening motion of the recombinant pv capsid leads to the destruction of predominant neutralizing epitopes and thus hinders the capsid as a vaccine immunogen. therefore, it is important to identify the intrinsic motions and the related key residues controlling the twofold channel opening for understanding the virus infection mechanism and developing capsid-based vaccines. in the present work, the width of the channel was selected as an internal coordinate directly related to the channel opening, and then the elastic network model (enm) combined with the group theory were employed to extract the intrinsic motion modes that mostly contribute to the opening of the twofold channels. our results show that the channel opening predominately induced by the breathing motion and the overall rotation of each protomer in the capsid. then, an internal coordinate-based perturbation method was used to identify the key residues regulating the twofold channel opening of pv. the calculation results showed that the predicted key residues are mainly located at the twofold axes, the bottom of the canyons and the quasi threefold axes. our study is helpful for better understanding the twofold channel opening mechanism and provides a potential target for preventing the opening of the channels, which is of great significance for pv vaccine design. the source code of this study is available at https://github.com/ sjglab/capsidkeyres.git.",AB_0026
