"fire and smoke object detection is of great significance due to the extreme destructive power of fire disasters. most of the existing methods, whether traditional computer vision-based models with sensors or deep learning-based models have circumscribed application scenes with relatively poor detection speed and accuracy. this means seldom taking smoke into consideration and always focusing on classification tasks. to advance object detection research in fire and smoke detection, we introduce a dataset called dfs (dataset for fire and smoke detection), which is of high quality, constructed by collecting from real scenes and annotated by strict and reasonable rules. to reduce the possibility of erroneous judgments caused by objects that are similar to fires in color and brightness, apart from annotating 'fire' and 'smoke', we annotate these objects as a new class 'other'. there are a total of 9462 images named by the fire size, which can benefit different detection tasks. furthermore, by carrying out extensive and abundant experiments on various object detection models, we provide a comprehensive benchmark on our dataset. experimental results show that dfs well represents real applications in fire and smoke detection and is quite challenging. we also test models with different training and testing proportions on our dataset to find the optimal split ratio in real situations. the dataset is released at https://github.com/siyuanwu/dfs-fire-smoke-dataset.",AB_0022
"human body movements are important for emotion recognition and social communication and have received extensive attention from researchers. in this field, emotional biological motion stimuli, as depicted by point-light displays, are widely used. however, the number of stimuli in the existing material library is small, and there is a lack of standardized indicators, which subsequently limits experimental design and conduction. therefore, based on our prior kinematic dataset, we constructed the dalian emotional movement open-source set (demos) using computational modeling. the demos has three views (i.e., frontal 0 degrees, left 45 degrees, and left 90 degrees) and in total comprises 2664 high-quality videos of emotional biological motion, each displaying happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. all stimuli were validated in terms of recognition accuracy, emotional intensity, and subjective movement. the objective movement for each expression was also calculated. the demos can be downloaded for free from https://osf.io/83fst/. to our knowledge, this is the largest multi-view emotional biological motion set based on the whole body. the demos can be applied in many fields, including affective computing, social cognition, and psychiatry.",AB_0022
"conventional multiview clustering seeks to partition data into respective groups based on the assumption that all views are fully observed. however, in practical applications, such as disease diagnosis, multimedia analysis, and recommendation system, it is common to observe that not all views of samples are available in many cases, which leads to the failure of the conventional multiview clustering methods. clustering on such incomplete multiview data is referred to as incomplete multiview clustering (imc). in view of the promising application prospects, the research of imc has noticeable advances in recent years. however, there is no survey to summarize the current progresses and point out the future research directions. to this end, we review the recent studies of imc. importantly, we provide some frameworks to unify the corresponding imc methods and make an in-depth comparative analysis for some representative methods from theoretical and experimental perspectives. finally, some open problems in the imc field are offered for researchers. the related codes are released at https://github.com/darrenzzhang/survey_imc.",AB_0022
"we present a novel and high-performance framework for 3d object detection using stereo vision. this framework incorporates direct instance depth estimation efficiently, improving the accuracy of the final 3d object detection. instead of detecting objects separately in the left and right images of a stereo display, we exploit a modified 2d object detector that takes only the left image as input to generate union 2d bounding boxes for both images, and to predict the depth of the 3d box center for each object. using the union 2d boxes, we propose a direct instance-level depth estimation network, taking the estimated depth as guidance, to predict the desired depths for pixels belonging to an object from a small search range. this approach greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of 3d detection. moreover, we design an adaptive spatial feature aggregation module that can weaken the effect of background points and automatically integrate important instance features to achieve accurate 3d object localization. our method outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo-based 3d detection methods on the kitti benchmark dataset, and it can efficiently employ a shared model for 3d multi-class detection. code will be available at https://github.com/xjtuwh/idepnet/trree/master.",AB_0022
"camouflaged object detection (cod) is a challenging task which aims to detect objects similar to the surrounding environment. in this paper, we propose a transformer-induced progressive refinement network (tprnet) to solve challenging cod tasks. specifically, our network includes a transformer-induced progressive refinement module (tprm) and a semantic-spatial interaction enhancement module (siem). in tprm, high-level features with rich semantic information are integrated through transformers as prior guidance, and then, it is sent to the refinement concurrency unit (rcu), and the accurately positioned feature area is obtained through a progressive refinement strategy. in siem, we perform feature interaction to localizedaccurate semantic features and low-level features to obtain rich fine-grained clues and increase the symbolic power of boundary features. extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets (i.e., camo, chameleon, cod10k, and nc4k) demonstrate that our tprnet is an effective cod model and outperforms state-of-the-art models. the code is available https://github.com/zhangyiao970914/tprnet.",AB_0022
"this paper presents a novel and fast emd-based (empirical mode decomposition-based) image fusion approach via morphological filter. firstly, we develop a multi-channel bidimensional emd method based on morphological filter to conduct image fusion. it uses the morphological expansion and erosion filters to compute the upper and lower envelopes of a multi-channel image in the sifting processing, and can decompose the input source images into several intrinsic mode functions (imfs) with different scales and a residue. it significantly improves the computation efficiency of emd for multi-channel images while maintaining the decomposition quality. secondly, we adopt a patch-based fusion strategy with overlapping partition to fuse the imfs and residue instead of the pixel-based fusion way usually used in emd-based image fusion, where an energy-based maximum selection rule is designed to fuse the imfs, and the feature information extracted by imfs is used as a guide to merge the residue. such strategy can extract the salient information of the source images well and can also reduce the spatial artifacts introduced by the noisy characteristics of the pixel-wise maps. a large number of comparative experiments on the fusion of several commonly used image data sets with multi-focus and multi-modal images, show that our newly proposed fusion method can obtain much better results than the existing emd-based image fusion approaches. furthermore, it is very competitive with the state-of-the-art image fusion methods in visualization, objective metrics, and time performance. the code of the proposed method can be downloaded from: https://github.com/neepuhjp/mfmbemd-imagefusion.",AB_0022
"the concept of k-core in complex networks plays a key role in many applications, e.g., understanding the global structure or identifying central/critical nodes, of a network. a malicious attacker with a jamming ability can exploit the vulnerability of the k-core structure to attack the network and invalidate the network analysis methods, e.g., reducing the k-shell values of nodes can deceive graph algorithms, leading to the wrong decisions. in this article, we investigate the robustness of the k-core structure under adversarial attacks by deleting edges, for the first time. first, we give the general definition of the targeted k-core attack, map it to the set cover problem, which is np-hard, and further introduce a series of evaluation metrics to measure the performance of attack methods. then, we propose the q index theoretically as the probability that the terminal node of an edge does not belong to the innermost core, which is further used to guide the design of our heuristic attack methods, namely, coreattack and greedycoreattack. the experiments on a variety of real-world networks demonstrate that our methods behave much better than a series of baselines, in terms of much smaller edge change rate (ecr) and false attack rate (far), achieving state-of-the-art attack performance. more impressively, for certain real-world networks, only deleting one edge from the k-core may lead to the collapse of the innermost core, even if this core contains dozens of nodes. such a phenomenon indicates that the k-core structure could be extremely vulnerable under adversarial attacks, and its robustness, thus. should be carefully addressed to ensure the security of marie graph algorithms. an open-source implementation is available at https://githuh.com/yocenly/coreattacck.",AB_0022
"with the increasing accessibility of remote sensing videos, remote sensing tracking is gradually becoming a hot issue. however, accurately detecting and tracking in complex remote sensing scenes is still a challenge. in this article, we propose a collaborative learning tracking network for remote sensing videos, including a consistent receptive field parallel fusion module (crfpf), dual-branch spatial-channel co-attention (dsca) module, and geometric constraint retrack strategy (gcrt). considering the small-size objects of remote sensing scenes are difficult for general forward networks to extract effective features, we propose a crfpf-module to establish parallel branches with consistent receptive fields to separately extract from shallow to deep features and then fuse hierarchical features adaptively. since the objects and their background are difficult to distinguish, the proposed dsca-module uses the spatial-channel co-attention mechanism to collaboratively learn the relevant information, which enhances the saliency of the objects and regresses to precise bounding boxes. considering the interference of similar objects, we designed a gcrt-strategy to judge whether there is a false detection through the estimated motion trajectory and then recover the correct object by weakening the feature response of interference. the experimental results and theoretical analysis on multiple datasets demonstrate our proposed method's feasibility and effectiveness. code and net are available at https://github.com/dawn5786/cocrf-tracknet.",AB_0022
"academic knowledge graph is an important application of knowledge graph in the vertical field of academia. at present, the construction of the academic knowledge graph is mainly completed by extracting published academic papers, authors, publications, and other information from related databases. however, academic information is not just information of published papers. scholars' academic activities include participation in academic conferences, visiting and making presentation, and so on. however, the above academic information is hidden in natural language texts and cannot be directly stored in academic knowledge graph. this article proposes an approach named construct-scholat knowledge graph to construct an academic event knowledge graph based on academic social network scholat. the construction framework mainly consists of two parts: data preprocessing and event extraction. in the data preprocessing, we propose a knowledge graph embedding method to represent scholars' academic social feature. in the event extraction, we concatenate the preprocessed scholar vector with academic we-media blog text into the extraction model based on bilstm-crf fused with attention mechanism. the extracted events are added to academic knowledge graph, and a public relationship exists between the event and the scholar. compared to the previous methods, our framework has an excellent performance after experimental verification. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the scholar academic social information of the scholar who edited the text as the event extraction input information. in addition, we publish a chinese event extraction dataset scholat academic event extraction.https://www.scholat.com/research/opendata the dataset includes academic we-media blog and the social behavior embedding vector of the scholar. all the data in this dataset are derived from the academic social network scholat.",AB_0022
"in this article, we present the chinese children's lexicon of written words (ccloww), the first grade-level database that provides frequency statistics of simplified chinese characters and words for children. the database computes from a corpus of 34,671,424 character tokens and 22,427,010 word tokens (including single- and multicharacter words), extracted from 2131 books. it contains 6746 different character types and 153,079 different word types. ccloww provides several frequency indices of simplified chinese for three grade levels (grade 2 and below, grades 3-4, grades 5-6) to profile children's experience with written chinese in and outside of school. we describe in this article the distributions of frequency and contextual diversity of the characters and words, as well as word length and syntactic categories of the words in the corpus and the subcorpora. we also report results of correlation analyses with other written corpora and of several naming and lexicon decision experiments. the findings suggest that ccloww frequency measures correlate well with other corpora. importantly, they could reliably predict children's and adults' naming and lexical decision performances. they could also explain variance in adults' visual word recognition, in addition to frequency measures computed in an adult corpus, indicating that early print exposure might influence readers' lexical processing later on beyond an age of acquisition effect. ccloww will help researchers in language processing and development as well as educators with selecting language materials appropriate for children's developmental stages. the database is freely available online at https://www.learn2read.cn/database/.",AB_0022
