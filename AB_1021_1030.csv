"background: recruiting study participants for clinical research is a challenging yet essential task. social media platforms, such as facebook, offer the opportunity to recruit participants through paid advertisements. these ad campaigns may be a cost-effective approach to reaching and recruiting participants who meet specific study criteria. however, little is known about the extent to which clicks on social media advertisements translate to the actual consent and enrollment of participants who meet the study criteria. understanding this is especially important for clinical trials conducted remotely, such as telehealth-based studies, which open the possibility to recruit over large geographical areas and are becoming more common for the treatment of chronic health conditions, such as osteoarthritis (oa). objective: the aim of this study was to report on the conversion of clicks on a facebook advertisement campaign to consent to enrollment in an ongoing telehealth physical therapy study for adults with knee oa, and the costs associated with recruitment. methods: this was a secondary analysis using data collected over the first 5 months of an ongoing study of adults with knee oa. the delaware physical exercise and activity for knee osteoarthritis program compares a virtually delivered exercise program to a control group receiving web-based resources among adults with knee oa. advertisement campaigns were configured on facebook to reach an audience who could be potentially eligible. clicking on the advertisement directed potential participants to a web-based screening form to answer 6 brief questions related to the study criteria. next, a research team member called individuals who met the criteria from the screening form and verbally asked additional questions related to the study criteria. once considered eligible, an electronic informed consent form (icf) was sent. we described the number of potential study participants who made it through each of these steps and then calculated the cost per participant who signed the icf. results: in sum, between july and november 2021, a total of 33,319 unique users saw at least one advertisement, 9879 clicks were made, 423 web-based screening forms were completed, 132 participants were successfully contacted, 70 were considered eligible, and 32 signed the icf. recruitment costed an average of us $51.94 per participant. conclusions: while there was a low conversion from clicks to actual consent, 32% (32/100) of the total sample required for the study were expeditiously consented over 5 months with a per-subject cost well below traditional means of recruitment, which ranges from us $90 to us $1000 per participant. trial registration: clinicaltrails.gov nct04980300; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04980300",AB_0103
"predicting the impact of coding and noncoding variants on splicing is challenging, particularly in non-canonical splice sites, leading to missed diagnoses in patients. existing splice prediction tools are complementary but knowing which to use for each splicing context remains difficult. here, we describe introme, which uses machine learning to integrate predictions from several splice detection tools, additional splicing rules, and gene architecture features to comprehensively evaluate the likelihood of a variant impacting splicing. through extensive benchmarking across 21,000 splice-altering variants, introme outperformed all tools (auprc: 0.98) for the detection of clinically significant splice variants. introme is available at https://github.com/ccicb/introme.",AB_0103
"selecting proper genome assembly is key for downstream analysis in genomics studies. however, the availability of many genome assembly tools and the huge variety of their running parameters challenge this task. the existing online evaluation tools are limited to specific taxa or provide just a onesided view on the assembly quality. we present webquast, a web server for multifaceted quality assessment and comparison of genome assemblies based on the state-of-the-art quast tool. the server is freely available at https:// www.ccb.uni- saarland. de/quast/. webquast can handle an unlimited number of genome assemblies and evaluate them against a user-provided or pre-loaded reference genome or in a completely reference-free fashion. we demonstrate keywebquast features in three common evaluation scenarios: assembly of an unknown species, amodel organism, and a close variant of it.

"deep network has become a new favorite for person re-identification (re-id), whose research focus is how to effectively extract the discriminative feature representation for pedestrians. in the paper, we propose a novel re -id network named as improved reidnet (ireidnet), which can effectively extract the local and global multi -granular feature representations of pedestrians by a well-designed spatial feature transform and coordinate attention (sftca) mechanism together with improved global pooling (igp) method. sftca utilizes channel adaptability and spatial location to infer a 2d attention map and can help ireidnet to focus on the salient in-formation contained in pedestrian images. igp makes ireidnet capture more effectively the global information of the whole human body. besides, to boost the recognition accuracy, we develop a weighted joint loss to guide the training of ireidnet. comprehensive experiments demonstrate the availability and superiority of ireidnet over other re-id methods. the code is available at https://github.com/xuruyu66/ ireidnet.",AB_0103
"this paper introduces openfibsem, a universal api to control focused ion beam scanning electron microscopes (fibsem). openfibsem aims to improve the programmability and automation of electron microscopy workflows in structural biology research. the api is designed to be cross-platform, composable, and extendable: allowing users to use any portion of openfibsem to develop or integrate with other software tools. the package provides core functionality such as imaging, movement, milling, and manipulator control, as well as system calibration, alignment, and image analysis modules. further, a library of reusable user interface components integrated with napari is provided, ensuring easy and efficient application development. openfibsem currently supports thermofisher and tescan hardware, with support for other manufacturers planned. to demonstrate the improved automation capabilities enabled by openfibsem, several example applications that are compatible with multiple hardware manufacturers are discussed. we argue that openfibsem provides the foundation for a cross-platform operating system and development ecosystem for fibsem systems. the api and applications are open-source and available on github (https://github.com/demarcolab/fibsem).",AB_0103
"the past few years have witnessed an explosion of attention given to the bias displayed by machine learning (ml) techniques towards different groups of people (e.g., female vs. male). although ml techniques have been widely adopted in education, it remains largely unexplored that to what extent such ml bias manifests itself in this specific setting and how it can be reduced and eliminated. given the increasing importance of ml techniques in empowering educators to teach effectively, this study aimed to quantify the characteristics of the original datasets that might be correlated with the subsequent predictive unfairness displayed by ml models. to this end, we empirically investigated two types of data biases (i.e., distribution bias and hardness bias) towards students of different sexes and first-language backgrounds across a total of five frequently-performed predictive tasks in education. then, to improve ml fairness, we drew inspiration from the well-established research in class balancing techniques (cbts), where samples are generated/removed to alleviate the predictive disparity between different prediction classes. we proposed two simple but effective strategies to empower class balancing techniques for alleviating data biases and improving prediction fairness. through extensive analyses and evaluations, we demonstrated that ml models may greatly improve prediction fairness (improvement up to 66%) with only a small sacrifice (less than 1%) in prediction accuracy by balancing the training data with the use of students' demographic information and the overall hardness bias measure. all data and code used in this study are publicly accessible via https://github.com/lsha49/fairedu.",AB_0103
"our daily lives are greatly impacted by traffic conditions, making it essential to have accurate predictions of traffic flow within a road network. traffic signals used for forecasting are usually generated by sensors along roads, which can be represented as nodes on a graph. these sensors typically produce normal signals representing normal traffic flows and abnormal signals indicating unknown traffic disruptions. graph convolution networks are widely used for traffic prediction due to their ability to capture correlations between network nodes. however, existing approaches use a predefined or adaptive adjacency matrix that does not accurately reflect real-world relationships between signals. to address this issue, we propose a decomposition dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network (ddgcrn) for traffic forecasting. ddgcrn combines a dynamic graph convolution recurrent network with an rnn-based model that generates dynamic graphs based on time-varying traffic signals, allowing for the extraction of both spatial and temporal features. additionally, ddgcrn separates abnormal signals from normal traffic signals and models them using a data-driven approach to further improve predictions. results from our analysis of six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of ddgcrn compared to the current state-of-the-art. the source codes are available at: https://github.com/wengwenchao123/ddgcrn .

"background: current treatment and management options for functional dyspepsia (fd) often fail to alleviate symptoms. naesohwajung-tang (nht) is a herbal formula frequently used to treat functional dyspepsia in traditional korean medicine. however, few animal and case reports on the use of naesohwajungtang for functional dyspepsia treatment exist, and the clinical evidence remains deficient. objectives: this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of naesohwajung-tang in patients with functional dyspepsia. methods: we enrolled 116 patients with functional dyspepsia at two study sites in this 4 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and randomly assigned them to either the naesohwajung-tang or placebo group. to evaluate the efficacy of naesohwajung-tang, the primary endpoint was a score on the total dyspepsia symptom (tds) scale after treatment. the overall treatment effect (ote), single dyspepsia symptom (sds) scale, food retention questionnaire (frq), damum questionnaire (dq), functional dyspepsia-related quality of life (fd-qol) questionnaire, and gastric myoelectrical activity measured using electrogastrography were evaluated as secondary outcomes. laboratory tests were performed to confirm the safety of the intervention. results: the 4 weeks administration of naesohwajung-tang granules demonstrated a significantly higher reduction in the total dyspepsia symptom (p < 0.05) and a higher degree of improvement in the total dyspepsia symptom (p < 0.01) than the placebo group. patients who underwent naesohwajung-tang had a significantly higher overall treatment effect and a greater increase in the degree of improvement in scores such as epigastric burning, postprandial fullness, early satiation, functional dyspepsia-related quality of life, and damum questionnaire (p < 0.05). additionally, the naesohwajung-tang group showed a greater effect in preventing a decrease in the percentage of normal gastric slow waves after meals than the placebo group. as a result of subgroup analyses using the degree of improvement in total dyspepsia symptom, naesohwajung-tang was found to be more effective than placebo in female, younger patients (<65 years), with a high body-mass index (>= 22), overlap type, food retention type, and dampness and heat in the spleen and stomach systems pattern. there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups. conclusion: this is the first randomized clinical trial to verify that naesohwajungtang leads on symptom relief in patients with functional dyspepsia. clinical trial registration: https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/search/detailsearch.do/17613, identifier kct0003405",AB_0103
"visual object tracking (vot) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to track a target in a se-quence of video frames. it has been broadly adopted in safety-and security-critical applications, such as self-driving systems and traffic control systems. however, the vot models (i.e., the trackers) that rely on third-party training resources face a severe threat of backdoor attacks , which refer to the type of the attacks that poison a portion of training data and mislead the tracker to track a wrong target. a surge of research interest has arisen in backdoor attacks in the domain of image classification, as a measure to expose the potential security risks of the classifiers and inspire new defense techniques. despite the prosperity of the research in backdoor attacks in image classification, there still lacks investigation in backdoor attacks against vot, due to their unique challenges: first, the architecture of a vot model is much more complicated than that of an image classifier; second, vot targets a sequence of video frames rather than individual images. to bridge the gap, we propose a novel and effective tar geted backdoor attack approach tat specifically against vot tasks. in particular, tat includes a basic version tat-ba that can achieve effective and stealthy backdoor attacks against vot trackers, and an advanced version tat-da that can evade two representative defense techniques. our large-scale experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and the stealthiness of tat . moreover, we also demonstrate the perfor-mances of tat-ba under real-world settings and the abilities of tat-da to counter defense techniques. the code will be available at https://github.com/misakazipi/tat .(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0103
"one of the problems in bioinformatics that artificial intelligence can solve is rna 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) site detection, which has become increasingly important because of its benefits, such as cost savings in labor, materials, and time consumption. to create a reliable identifier, performance results must be as high as possible. in this study, we developed xgb5hmc, a high-performance identifier of rna 5hmc. we use extreme gradient boosting (xgb) as the best model. in addition, we investigated other models, such as random forest (rf), ada boosting (ab), and gradient boosting (gb). first, ilearnplus was used to run 15 different machine learning models using 35 different descriptors to select the best descriptors. then, it was decided that the composition of k-spaced nucleic acid pairs (cksnap), pseudo-k-tuple nucleotide composition (pseknc), and position-specific trinucleotide propensity single strand (pstnpss) are the best descriptors. subsequently, the features were combined and reduced in dimension using chi-squared test filtering. using these filtered features and the xgb model, we obtained better performance than the state-of-the-art methods. the increases in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and mcc values were 11.43, 15.82, 8.94, and 24.58%, respectively. this implies that our model improved as a reliable identifier to detect 5hmc. all datasets and complete source codes can be accessed freely at https://github.com/asw1982/xgb5hmc.",AB_0103
