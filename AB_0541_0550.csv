"sulfatlas (https:// sulfatlas.sb-roscoff.fr/) is a knowledge-based resource dedicated to a sequence-based classification of sulfatases. currently four sulfatase families exist (s1-s4) and the largest family (s1, formylglycine-dependent sulfatases) is divided into subfamilies by a phylogenetic approach, each subfamily corresponding to either a single characterized specificity (or few specificities in some cases) or to unknown substrates. sequences are linked to their biochemical and structural information according to an expert scrutiny of the available literature. database browsing was initially made possible both through a keyword search engine and a specific sequence similarity (blast) server. in this article, we will briefly summarize the experimental progresses in the sulfatase field in the last 6 years. to improve and speed up the (sub)family assignment of sulfatases in (meta)genomic data, we have developed a new, freely-accessible search engine using hidden markov model (hmm) for each (sub)family. this new tool (sulfatlas hmm) is also a key part of the internal pipeline used to regularly update the database. sulfatlas resource has indeed significantly grown since its creation in 2016, from 4550 sequences to 162 430 sequences in august 2022.",AB_0055
"kegg (https://www.kegg.jp ) is a manually curated database resource integrating various biological objects categorized into systems, genomic, chemical and health information. each object (database entry) is identified by the kegg identifier (kid), which generally takes the form of a prefix followed by a five-digit number, and can be retrieved by appending /entry/kid in the url. the kegg pathway map viewer, the brite hierarchy viewer and the newly released kegg genome browser can be launched by appending /pathway/kid, /brite/kid and /genome/kid, respectively, in the url. together with an improved annotation procedure for ko (kegg orthology) assignment, an increasing number of eukaryotic genomes have been included in kegg for better representation of organisms in the taxonomic tree. multiple taxonomy files are generated for classification of kegg organisms and viruses, and the brite hierarchy viewer is used for taxonomy mapping, a variant of brite mapping in the new kegg mapper suite. the taxonomy mapping enables analysis of, for example, how functional links of genes in the pathway and physical links of genes on the chromosome are conserved among organism groups.",AB_0055

"in phylogenomics the evolutionary relationship of organisms is studied by their genomic information. a common approach to phylogenomics is to extract related genes from each organism, build a multiple sequence alignment and then reconstruct evolution relations through a phylogenetic tree. often a set of highly conserved genes occurring in singlecopy, called core genes, are used for this analysis, as they allow efficient automation within a taxonomic glade. here we introduce the universal fungal core genes (ufcg) database and pipeline for genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of fungi. the ufcg database consists of 61 curated fungal marker genes, including a novel set of 41 computationally derived core genes and 20 canonical genes derived from literature, as well as marker gene sequences extracted from publicly available fungal genomes. furthermore, we provide an easy-to-use, fully automated and open-source pipeline for marker gene extraction, training and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. the ufcg pipeline can identify marker genes from genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data, while producing phylogenies consistent with those previously reported, and is publicly available together with the ufcg database at https://ufcg.steineggerlab.com.",AB_0055
"human game observers, who control in-game cameras and provide viewers with an engaging experience, are a vital part of electronic sports (esports) which has emerged as a rapidly growing industry in recent years. however, such a professional human observer poses several problems. for example, they are prone to missing events occurring concurrently across the map. further, human game observers are difficult to afford when only a small number of spectators are spectating the game. consequently, various methods to create automatic observers have been explored, and these methods are based on defining in-game events and focus on defined events. however, these event-based methods necessitate detailed predefined events, demanding high domain knowledge when developing. additionally, these methods cannot show scenes that contain undefined events. in this paper, we propose a method to overcome these problems by utilizing multiple human observational data and an object detection method, mask r-cnn, in a real-time strategy game (e.g., starcraft). by learning from human observational data, our method can observe scenes that are not defined as events in advance. the proposed model utilizes an object detection mechanism to find the area where the human spectator is interested. we consider the pattern of the two-dimensional spatial area that the spectator is looking at as the object to find, rather than treating a single unit or building as an object which is conventionally done in object detection. consequently, we show that our automatic observer outperforms both current rule-based methods and human observers. the game observation video that compares our method and the rule-based method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61jifsrlhvk.",AB_0055
"atomic-level knowledge of protein-ligand interactions allows a detailed understanding of protein functions and provides critical clues to discovering molecules regulating the functions. while recent innovative deep learning methods for protein structure prediction dramatically increased the structural coverage of the human proteome, molecular interactions remain largely unknown. a new database, hproteome-bsite, provides predictions of binding sites and ligands in the enlarged 3d human proteome. the model structures for human proteins from the alphafold protein structure database were processed to structural domains of high confidence to maximize the coverage and reliability of interaction prediction. for ligand binding site prediction, an updated version of a template-based method galaxysite was used. a high-level performance of the updated galaxysite was confirmed. hproteome-bsite covers 80.74% of the uniprot entries in the alphafold human 3d proteome. predicted binding sites and binding poses of potential ligands are provided for effective applications to further functional studies and drug discovery. the hproteome-bsite database is available at https://galaxy.seoklab.org/hproteome-bsite/database and is free and open to all users.",AB_0055
"this paper presents a new approach to design the architecture and optimize the hyperparameters of a deep convolutional neural network (cnn) via of the fractal decomposition algorithm (fda). this optimization algorithm was recently proposed to solve continuous optimization problems. it is based on a geometric fractal decomposition that divides the search space while searching for the best solution possible. as fda is effective in single-objective optimization, in this work we aim to prove that it can also be successfully applied to fine-tuning deep neural network architectures.moreover, a new formulation based on bi-level optimization is proposed to separate the architecture search composed of discrete parameters from hyperparameters' optimization. this is motivated by the fact that automating the construction of deep neural architecture has been an important focus over recent years as manual construction is considerably time-consuming, error-prone, and requires in-depth knowledge. to solve the bi-level problem thus formulated, a random search is performed aiming to create a set of candidate architectures. then, the best ones are finetuned using fda. cifar-10 and cifar-100 benchmarks were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. the results obtained are among the state of the art in the corresponding class of networks (low number of parameters and chained-structured cnn architectures). the results are emphasized by the fact that the whole process was performed using low computing power with only 3 nvidia v100 gpus. the source code is available at https://github.com/alc1218/convolutional-neural-network-architecture-search-based-on-fractal-decomposition-optimization.",AB_0055
"complex chemical systems containing multiple heterogeneous substructures are common in real-world chemical applications, such as hybrid perovskites and inorganic catalysts. although graph neural networks (gnns) have achieved numerous successes in predicting the physical and chemical properties of a single molecule or crystal structure, gnns for multiple heterogeneous substructures have not yet been studied in chemical science. in this paper, we propose substructure interaction graph network with node augmentation (signna) that is an integrated architecture of heterogeneous gnns to predict the physical and chemical properties from the interactions between the heterogeneous substructures of the chemical systems. in addition to the network architecture, we devise a node augmentation method to generate valid subgraphs from given chemical systems for graph-based machine learning, even though the decomposed substructures are physically invalid. signna outperformed state-of-the-art gnns in the experimental evaluations and the high-throughput screening on benchmark materials datasets of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and inorganic catalysts. the source code of signna is publicly available at https://github.com/ngs00/signna.",AB_0055
"middle eocene deep-sea sediment sequences cored at ocean drilling program site 1260 (leg 207; equatorial atlantic ocean) yielded diverse and abundant radiolarian faunas that are conducive to biostratigraphic and palaeoceanographic research, as well as to the study of radiolarian diversity dynamics during this epoch of significant climate changes. however, many species present in these sediments still have not been formally described and are therefore neglected in most biodiversity surveys. in an effort to improve the taxonomic resolution of middle eocene radiolarians, 15 new species of nassellarians are described and illustrated. the species are: cymaetron? dilatatus n. sp., eucyrtidium levisaltatrix n. sp. (eucyrtidiidae), siphocampe pollen n. sp., spirocyrtis? renaudiei n. sp. (artostrobiidae), pterocyrtidium eep n. sp. (rhopalosyringiidae), petalospyris cometa n. sp., petalospyris castanea n. sp. (cephalospyrididae), velicucullus armatus n. sp. (theophormididae), lychnocanium nimrodi n. sp. (lithochytrididae), aphetocyrtis zamenhofi n. sp., aphetocyrtis? columboi n. sp., aphetocyrtis? spheniscus n. sp. (lophocyrtiidae), albatrossidium regis n. sp., albatrossidium annikasanfilippoae n. sp., and phormocyrtis lazari n. sp. (pterocorythidae). stratigraphic range data are provided for each new species, as well as the orbitally tuned ages for their first and last occurrences. in addition to these new species, we also illustrate and document the stratigraphic distribution of four species described in early radiolarian studies and rarely reported since. uuid: http://zoobank.org/b5993e6b-659b-4220-80c2-c6ddccc13793",AB_0055
"adversarial patches are optimized contiguous pixel blocks in an input image that cause a machine -learning model to misclassify it. however, their optimization is computationally demanding, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to suboptimal robustness evaluations. to overcome these issues, we propose imagenet-patch, a dataset to benchmark machine-learning models against ad-versarial patches. the dataset is built by first optimizing a set of adversarial patches against an ensemble of models, using a state-of-the-art attack that creates transferable patches. the corresponding patches are then randomly rotated and translated, and finally applied to the imagenet data. we use imagenet-patch to benchmark the robustness of 127 models against patch attacks, and also validate the effectiveness of the given patches in the physical domain (i.e., by printing and applying them to real-world objects). we conclude by discussing how our dataset could be used as a benchmark for robustness, and how our methodology can be generalized to other domains. we open source our dataset and evaluation code at https://github.com/pralab/imagenet-patch .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0055
