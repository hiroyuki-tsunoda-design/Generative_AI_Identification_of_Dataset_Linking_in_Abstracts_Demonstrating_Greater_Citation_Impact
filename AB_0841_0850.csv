"proteases contribute to a broad spectrum of cellular functions. given a relatively limited amount of experimental data, developing accurate sequence-based predictors of substrate cleavage sites facilitates a better understanding of protease functions and substrate specificity. while many protease-specific predictors of substrate cleavage sites were developed, these efforts are outpaced by the growth of the protease substrate cleavage data. in particular, since data for 100+ protease types are available and this number continues to grow, it becomes impractical to publish predictors for new protease types, and instead it might be better to provide a computational platform that helps users to quickly and efficiently build predictors that address their specific needs. to this end, we conceptualized, developed, tested and released a versatile bioinformatics platform, prosperousplus, that empowers users, even those with no programming or little bioinformatics background, to build fast and accurate predictors of substrate cleavage sites. prosperousplus facilitates the use of the rapidly accumulating substrate cleavage data to train, empirically assess and deploy predictive models for user-selected substrate types. benchmarking tests on test datasets show that our platform produces predictors that on average exceed the predictive performance of current state-of-the-art approaches. prosperousplus is available as a webserver and a stand-alone software package at http://prosperousplus.unimelb-biotools.cloud.edu.au/.",AB_0085
"ncrna-encoded small peptides (ncpeps) have recently emerged as promising targets and biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. therefore, identifying cancer-associated ncpeps is crucial for cancer research. in this work, we propose coral, a novel supervised contrastive meta-learning framework for predicting cancer-associated ncpeps. specifically, the proposed meta-learning strategy enables our model to learn meta-knowledge from different types of peptides and train a promising predictive model even with few labeled samples. the results show that our model is capable of making high-confidence predictions on unseen cancer biomarkers with only five samples, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel cancer biomarkers for immunotherapy. moreover, our approach remarkably outperforms existing deep learning models on 15 cancer-associated ncpeps datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. interestingly, our model exhibits outstanding performance when extended for the identification of short open reading frames derived from ncpeps, demonstrating the strong prediction ability of coral at the transcriptome level. importantly, our feature interpretation analysis discovers unique sequential patterns as the fingerprint for each cancer-associated ncpeps, revealing the relationship among certain cancer biomarkers that are validated by relevant literature and motif comparison. overall, we expect coral to be a useful tool to decipher the pathogenesis of cancer and provide valuable information for cancer research. the dataset and source code of our proposed method can be found at https://github.com/johnsunnn/coral.",AB_0085
"recent advancements in deep learning have brought significant improvements to plant disease recognition. however, achieving satisfactory performance often requires high-quality training datasets, which are challenging and expensive to collect. consequently, the practical application of current deep learning-based methods in real-world scenarios is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. in this paper, we argue that embracing poor datasets is viable and aims to explicitly define the challenges associated with using these datasets. to delve into this topic, we analyze the characteristics of high-quality datasets, namely, large-scale images and desired annotation, and contrast them with the limited and imperfect nature of poor datasets. challenges arise when the training datasets deviate from these characteristics. to provide a comprehensive understanding, we propose a novel and informative taxonomy that categorizes these challenges. furthermore, we offer a brief overview of existing studies and approaches that address these challenges. we point out that our paper sheds light on the importance of embracing poor datasets, enhances the understanding of the associated challenges, and contributes to the ambitious objective of deploying deep learning in real-world applications. to facilitate the progress, we finally describe several outstanding questions and point out potential future directions. although our primary focus is on plant disease recognition, we emphasize that the principles of embracing and analyzing poor datasets are applicable to a wider range of domains, including agriculture. our project is public available at https://github.com/xml94/embracinglimitedimperfecttrainingdatasets.",AB_0085
"plant vacuoles are essential organelles in the growth and development of plants, and accurate identification of their proteins is crucial for understanding their biological properties. in this study, we developed a novel model called graphidn for the identification of plant vacuole proteins. the model uses seqvec, a deep representation learning model, to initialize the amino acid sequence. we utilized the alphafold2 algorithm to obtain the structural information of corresponding plant vacuole proteins, and then fed the calculated contact maps into a graph convolutional neural network. graphidn achieved accuracy values of 88.51% and 89.93% in independent testing and fivefold cross-validation, respectively, outperforming previous state-of-the-art predictors. as far as we know, this is the first model to use predicted protein topology structure graphs to identify plant vacuole proteins. furthermore, we assessed the effectiveness and generalization capability of our graphidn model by applying it to identify and locate peroxisomal proteins, which yielded promising outcomes. the source code and datasets can be accessed at https://github.com/sjnnnn/graphidn.",AB_0085
"motivation identifying drug-protein interactions (dpis) is a critical step in drug repositioning, which allows reuse of approved drugs that may be effective for treating a different disease and thereby alleviates the challenges of new drug development. despite the fact that a great variety of computational approaches for dpi prediction have been proposed, key challenges, such as extendable and unbiased similarity calculation, heterogeneous information utilization, and reliable negative sample selection, remain to be addressed.results to address these issues, we propose a novel, unified multi-view graph autoencoder framework, termed mulga, for both dpi and drug repositioning predictions. mulga is featured by: (i) a multi-view learning technique to effectively learn authentic drug affinity and target affinity matrices; (ii) a graph autoencoder to infer missing dpi interactions; and (iii) a new guilty-by-association-based negative sampling approach for selecting highly reliable non-dpis. benchmark experiments demonstrate that mulga outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dpi prediction and the ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each proposed component. importantly, we highlight the top drugs shortlisted by mulga that target the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sar-cov-2), offering additional insights into and potentially useful treatment option for covid-19. together with the availability of datasets and source codes, we envision that mulga can be explored as a useful tool for dpi prediction and drug repositioning.availability and implementation mulga is publicly available for academic purposes at https://github.com/jianim/mulga/.",AB_0085
"due to the development of sequence technology and decreased cost, many whole genome sequences have been obtained. as a result, extensive genetic variations have been discovered from many populations and germplasms to understand the genetic diversity of soybean (glycine max [l.] merr.). however, assessing the quality of variation is essential because the published variants were collected using different bioinformatic methods and parameters. furthermore, despite the enhanced genome contiguity and more efficient filling of n stretches in the new reference genome, there remains a dearth of endeavors to verify the caliber of variations present in it. the primary goal of this research was to discern a dependable set of snps that can withstand reconciliation across multiple reference genomes. additionally, the investigation aimed to reconfirm the variations through the utilization of numerous whole genome sequencing data obtained from publicly available databases. based on the result, we created datasets that comprised the thoroughly verified snp coordinates between the reference assemblies. the resulting soydbean database is now publicly accessible through the following url: http://soydbean.plantprofile.net/.",AB_0085
"we propose a one-shot ultra-high-resolution generative adversarial network (our-gan) framework that generates non-repetitive 16k (16, 384 x 8, 640) images from a single training image and is trainable on a single consumer gpu. our-gan generates an initial image that is visually plausible and varied in shape at low resolution, and then gradually increases the resolution by adding detail through super-resolution. since our-gan learns from a real ultra-high-resolution (uhr) image, it can synthesize large shapes with fine details and longrange coherence, which is difficult to achieve with conventional generative models that rely on the patch distribution learned from relatively small images. our-gan can synthesize high-quality 16k images with 12.5 gb of gpu memory and 4k images with only 4.29 gb as it synthesizes a uhr image part by part through seamless subregion-wise super-resolution. additionally, our-gan improves visual coherence while maintaining diversity by applying vertical positional convolution. in experiments on the st4k and raise datasets, our-gan exhibited improved fidelity, visual coherency, and diversity compared with the baseline one-shot synthesis models. to the best of our knowledge, our-gan is the first one-shot image synthesizer that generates non-repetitive uhr images on a single consumer gpu. the synthesized image samples are presented at https://our-gan.github.io.",AB_0085
"the optimal percent oversizing (%os) using the sapien3 ultra (s3u) weighing the incidence of paravalvular regurgitation (pvr) >= mild against the risk of conduction disturbance (cd) is not known. this study sought to define an optimal extent of the annulus area %os suitable for transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the s3u compared with the sapien3 (s3). a total of 350 patients with the s3u were compared with 606 patients with the s3. patients were categorized depending on the degree of %os. pvr >= mild was observed in 8.9% of patients with the s3u and in 21.8% of those with the s3 (p <0.001). the s3u demonstrated a sustainably lower incidence of pvr >= mild than the s3 in any extent of %os. there was an inverse proportional relation between the extent of %os and frequency of pvr >= mild in the s3, whereas the s3u group provided little change. the incidences of pvr >= mild were steady >5%os in the s3 (5% to 10%os: 13.3%, and >10%os: 12.1%) and >0%os in the s3u (0% to 5%os: 5.9%, 5% to 10%os: 6.0%, and >10%os: 6.1%). an increasing %os was independently associated with the occurrence of cd (<0%os: 9.8%, 0% to 5%os: 13.1%, 5% to 10%os: 16.6%, and >10%os: 19.2%, p = 0.012). the incidence of pvr >= mild and/or cd was the lowest (10.1%) in the 0% to 5%os in patients with the s3u. in conclusion, the homosapien2 study suggests that the s3u tolerates a lesser degree of %os for mitigating pvr >= mild than the s3. minimal %os, ranging from 0% to 5%, may be optimal for the s3u with balancing the risk of pvr and cd. trial identifier: umin000040413/url: https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=r000046115.(c) 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( licenses/by/4.0/) (am j cardiol 2023;207:140-149)",AB_0085
"guidelines from the world health organization strongly recommend the use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (fio(2)) in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia to reduce surgical site infection (ssi). however, previous meta-analyses reported inconsistent results. we aimed to address this controversy by focusing specifically on abdominal surgery with relatively high risk of ssi. medline, embase, and cochrane central databases were searched. randomized trials of abdominal surgery comparing high to low perioperative fio(2) were included, given that the incidence of ssi was reported as an outcome. meta-analyses of risk ratios (rr) were performed using a fixed effects model. subgroup analysis and meta-regression were employed to explore sources of heterogeneity. we included 27 trials involving 15977 patients. the use of high fio(2) significantly reduced the incidence of ssi (n=27, risk ratio (rr): 0.87; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.79, 0.95; i-2=49%, z=3.05). trial sequential analysis (tsa) revealed that z-curve crossed the trial sequential boundary and data are sufficient. this finding held true for the subgroup of emergency operations (n=2, rr: 0.54; 95% ci: 0.35, 0.84; i-2=0%, z=2.75), procedures using air as carrier gas (n=9, rr: 0.79; 95% ci: 0.69, 0.91; i-2=60%, z=3.26), and when a high level of fio(2) was maintained for a postoperative 6 h or more (n=9, rr: 0.68; 95% ci: 0.56, 0.83; i-2=46%, z=3.83). meta-regression revealed no significant interaction between ssi with any covariates including age, sex, body-mass index, diabetes mellitus, duration of surgery, and smoking. quality of evidence was assessed to be moderate to very low. our pooled analysis revealed that the application of high fio(2) reduced the incidence of ssi after abdominal operations. although tsa demonstrated sufficient data and cumulative analysis crossed the tsa boundary, our results should be interpreted cautiously given the low quality of evidence.registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero (crd42022369212) on october 2022.",AB_0085
"motivation computationally predicting major histocompatibility complex class i (mhc-i) peptide binding affinity is an important problem in immunological bioinformatics, which is also crucial for the identification of neoantigens for personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines. recent cutting-edge deep learning-based methods for this problem cannot achieve satisfactory performance, especially for non-9-mer peptides. this is because such methods generate the input by simply concatenating the two given sequences: a peptide and (the pseudo sequence of) an mhc class i molecule, which cannot precisely capture the anchor positions of the mhc binding motif for the peptides with variable lengths. we thus developed an anchor position-aware and high-performance deep model, deepmhci, with a position-wise gated layer and a residual binding interaction convolution layer. this allows the model to control the information flow in peptides to be aware of anchor positions and model the interactions between peptides and the mhc pseudo (binding) sequence directly with multiple convolutional kernels.results the performance of deepmhci has been thoroughly validated by extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets under various settings, such as 5-fold cross-validation, validation with the independent testing set, external hpv vaccine identification, and external cd8+ epitope identification. experimental results with visualization of binding motifs demonstrate that deepmhci outperformed all competing methods, especially on non-9-mer peptides binding prediction.availability and implementation deepmhci is publicly available at https://github.com/zhulab-fudan/deepmhci.",AB_0085
