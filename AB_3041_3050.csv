"patient-derived gene expression signatures induced by cancer treatment, obtained from paired pre- and post-treatment clinical transcriptomes, can help reveal drug mechanisms of action (moas) in cancer patients and understand the molecular response mechanism of tumor sensitivity or resistance. their integration and reuse may bring new insights. paired pre- and post-treatment clinical transcriptomic data are rapidly accumulating. however, a lack of systematic collection makes data access, integration, and reuse challenging. we therefore present the cancer drug-induced gene expression signature database (cds-db). cds-db has collected 78 patient-derived, paired pre- and post-treatment transcriptomic source datasets with uniformly reprocessed expression profiles and manually curated metadata such as drug administration dosage, sampling time and location, and intrinsic drug response status. from these source datasets, 2012 patient-level gene perturbation signatures were obtained, covering 85 therapeutic regimens, 39 cancer subtypes and 3628 patient samples. besides data browsing, download and search, cds-db also supports single signature analysis (including differential gene expression, functional enrichment, tumor microenvironment and correlation analyses), signature comparative analysis and signature connectivity analysis. this provides insights into drug moa and its heterogeneity in patients, drug resistance mechanisms, drug repositioning and drug (combination) discovery, etc. cds-db is available at http://cdsdb.ncpsb.org.cn/. graphical abstract",AB_0305
"enhancer rnas (ernas) transcribed from distal active enhancers serve as key regulators in gene transcriptional regulation. the accumulation of ernas from multiple sequencing assays has led to an urgent need to comprehensively collect and process these data to illustrate the regulatory landscape of ernas. to address this need, we developed the ernabase (http://bio.liclab.net/ernabase/index.php) to store the massive available resources of human and mouse ernas and provide comprehensive annotation and analyses for ernas. the current version of ernabase cataloged 10 399 928 ernas from 1012 samples, including 858 human samples and 154 mouse samples. these ernas were first identified and uniformly processed from 14 erna-related experiment types manually collected from geo/sra and encode. importantly, the ernabase provides detailed and abundant (epi)genetic annotations in erna regions, such as super enhancers, enhancers, common single nucleotide polymorphisms, expression quantitative trait loci, transcription factor binding sites, crispr/cas9 target sites, dnase i hypersensitivity sites, chromatin accessibility regions, methylation sites, chromatin interactions regions, topologically associating domains and rna spatial interactions. furthermore, the ernabase provides users with three novel analyses including erna-mediated pathway regulatory analysis, erna-based variation interpretation analysis and erna-mediated tf-target gene analysis. hence, ernabase is a powerful platform to query, browse and visualize regulatory cues associated with ernas. graphical abstract",AB_0305
"influenza viruses undergo frequent genomic mutations, leading to potential cross-species transmission, phenotypic changes, and challenges in diagnostic reagents and vaccines. accurately evaluating and predicting the risk of such variations remain significant challenges. to address this, we developed the vareps-influ database, an influenza virus variations risk evaluation system (vareps-influ). this database employs a 'multi-dimensional evaluation of mutations' strategy, utilizing various tools to assess the physical and chemical properties, primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, receptor affinity, antibody binding capacity, antigen epitopes, and other aspects of the variation's impact. additionally, we consider space-time distribution, host species distribution, pedigree analysis, and frequency of mutations to provide a comprehensive risk evaluation of mutations and viruses. the vareps-influ database evaluates both observed variations and virtual variations (variations that have not yet occurred), thereby addressing the time-lag issue in risk predictions. our current one-stop evaluation system for influenza virus genomic variation integrates 1065290 sequences from 224 927 influenza a, b and c isolates retrieved from public resources. researchers can freely access the data at https://nmdc.cn/influvar/. graphical abstract",AB_0305
"the high cost of large-scale, high-coverage whole-genome sequencing has limited its application in genomics and genetics research. the common approach has been to impute whole-genome sequence variants obtained from a few individuals for a larger population of interest individually genotyped using snp chip. an alternative involves low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (lcwgs) of all individuals in the larger population, followed by imputation to sequence resolution. to overcome limitations of processing lcwgs data and meeting specific genotype imputation requirements, we developed agidb (https://agidb.pro), a website comprising tools and database with an unprecedented sample size and comprehensive variant decoding for animals. agidb integrates whole-genome sequencing and chip data from 17 360 and 174 945 individuals, respectively, across 89 species to identify over one billion variants, totaling a massive 688.57 tb of processed data. agidb focuses on integrating multiple genotype imputation scenarios. it also provides user-friendly searching and data analysis modules that enable comprehensive annotation of genetic variants for specific populations. to meet a wide range of research requirements, agidb offers downloadable reference panels for each species in addition to its extensive dataset, variant decoding and utility tools. we hope that agidb will become a key foundational resource in genetics and breeding, providing robust support to researchers. graphical abstract",AB_0305
"rnas play essential roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes by interacting with other molecules (rna/protein/compound), and various computational methods are available for identifying these interactions. however, the encoding features provided by existing methods are limited and the existing tools does not offer an effective way to integrate the interacting partners. in this study, a task-specific encoding algorithm for rnas and rna-associated interactions was therefore developed. this new algorithm was unique in (a) realizing comprehensive rna feature encoding by introducing a great many of novel features and (b) enabling task-specific integration of interacting partners using convolutional autoencoder-directed feature embedding. compared with existing methods/tools, this novel algorithm demonstrated superior performances in diverse benchmark testing studies. this algorithm together with its source code could be readily accessed by all user at: https://idrblab.org/corain/ and https://github.com/idrblab/corain/. graphical abstract",AB_0305
"dna methylation plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, sparking substantial interest in the clinical applications of cancer dna methylation biomarkers. cancer-related whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (wgbs) data offers a promising approach to precisely identify these biomarkers with differentially methylated regions (dmrs). however, currently there is no dedicated resource for cancer dna methylation biomarkers with wgbs data. here, we developed a comprehensive cancer dna methylation biomarker database (methmarkerdb, https://methmarkerdb.hzau.edu.cn/), which integrated 658 wgbs datasets, incorporating 724 curated dna methylation biomarker genes from 1425 pubmed published articles. based on wgbs data, we documented 5.4 million dmrs from 13 common types of cancer as candidate dna methylation biomarkers. we provided search and annotation functions for these dmrs with different resources, such as enhancers and snps, and developed diagnostic and prognostic models for further biomarker evaluation. with the database, we not only identified known dna methylation biomarkers, but also identified 781 hypermethylated and 5245 hypomethylated pan-cancer dmrs, corresponding to 693 and 2172 genes, respectively. these novel potential pan-cancer dna methylation biomarkers hold significant clinical translational value. we hope that methmarkerdb will help identify novel cancer dna methylation biomarkers and propel the clinical application of these biomarkers. graphical abstract",AB_0305
"precision medicine depends on high-accuracy individual-level genotype data. however, the whole-genome sequencing (wgs) is still not suitable for gigantic studies due to budget constraints. it is particularly important to construct highly accurate haplotype reference panel for genotype imputation. in this study, we used 10 000 samples with medium-depth wgs to construct a reference panel that we named the ckb reference panel. by imputing microarray datasets, it showed that the ckb panel outperformed compared panels in terms of both the number of well-imputed variants and imputation accuracy. in addition, we have completed the imputation of 100 706 microarrays with the ckb panel, and the after-imputed data is the hitherto largest whole genome data of the chinese population. furthermore, in the gwas analysis of real phenotype height, the number of tested snps tripled and the number of significant snps doubled after imputation. finally, we developed an online server for offering free genotype imputation service based on the ckb reference panel (https://db.cngb.org/imputation/). we believe that the ckb panel is of great value for imputing microarray or low-coverage genotype data of chinese population, and potentially mixed populations. the imputation-completed 100 706 microarray data are enormous and precious resources of population genetic studies for complex traits and diseases. graphical abstract",AB_0305
"synthetic lethal (sl) pairs are pairs of genes whose simultaneous loss-of-function results in cell death, while a damaging mutation of either gene alone does not affect the cell's survival. this makes sl pairs attractive targets for precision cancer therapies, as targeting the unimpaired gene of the sl pair can selectively kill cancer cells that already harbor the impaired gene. limited by the difficulty of finding true sl pairs, especially on specific cell types, current computational approaches provide only limited insights because of overlooking the crucial aspects of cellular context dependency and mechanistic understanding of sl pairs. as a result, the identification of sl targets still relies on expensive, time-consuming experimental approaches. in this work, we applied cell-line specific multi-omics data to a specially designed deep learning model to predict cell-line specific sl pairs. through incorporating multiple types of cell-specific omics data with a self-attention module, we represent gene relationships as graphs. our approach achieves the prediction of sl pairs in a cell-specific manner and demonstrates the potential to facilitate the discovery of cell-specific sl targets for cancer therapeutics, providing a tool to unearth mechanisms underlying the origin of sl in cancer biology. the code and data of our approach can be found at https://github.com/promethiume/slwise",AB_0305
"the crispr/cas9 system has significantly advanced the field of gene editing, yet its clinical application is constrained by the considerable challenge of off-target effects. although numerous deep learning models for off-target prediction have been proposed, most struggle to effectively extract the nuanced features of guide rna (grna) and dna sequence pairs and to mitigate information loss during data transmission within the model. to address these limitations, we introduce a novel hybrid neural network (hnn) model that employs a parallelized network structure to fully extract pertinent features from different positions and types of bases in the sequence to minimize information loss. notably, this study marks the first application of word embedding techniques to extract information from sequence pairs that contain insertions and deletions (indels). comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets indicates that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction methods in off-target prediction. the datasets and source codes supporting this study can be found at https:// github .com /yang -k955 /crispr -hw.",AB_0305
"the snf2 protein family is a group of atp-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (chrs) that play an essential role in gene expression regulation. in plants, snf2 is involved in growth, development, as well as stress resistance. however, only a very limited number of experimentally validated snf2 have been identified and reported, while the majority remaining undiscovered in most species . in this study, we predicted 3135 snf2 proteins and 8398 chromatin remodeling complex (crc) subunits in diverse plant species, and constructed the plant chromatin remodeling factors database (plantchrs, http://www.functionalgenomics.cn/plantchrs/), which provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to access information about plant chrs. we also developed an online tool capable of predicting chrs and crc subunits. moreover, we investigated the distribution of snf2 proteins in different species and observed a significant increase in the number of snf2 proteins and the diversity of the snf2 subfamily during the evolution, highlighting their evolutionary importance. by analyzing the expression patterns of the snf2 genes in different tissues of maize and arabidopsis, we found that the snf2 proteins may show some conservation across different species in regulating plant growth and development. over the all, we established a comprehensive database for plant chrs, which will facilitate the researches on plant chromatin remodeling.",AB_0305
