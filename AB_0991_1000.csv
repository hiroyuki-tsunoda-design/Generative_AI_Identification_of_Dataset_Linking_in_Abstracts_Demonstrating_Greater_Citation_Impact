"complex-valued neural networks (cvnns) have been widely applied in various fields, primarily in signal processing and image recognition. few studies have focused on the generalisation of cvnns, although it is vital to ensure the performance of cvnns on unseen data. this study is the first to prove a generalisation bound for complex-valued neural networks. the bounds increase as the spectral complexity increases, with the dominant factor being the product of the spectral norms of the weight matrices. furthermore, this work provides a generalisation bound for cvnns trained on sequential data, which is also affected by the spectral complexity. theoretically, these bounds are derived using the maurey sparsification lemma and dudley entropy integral. we conducted empirical experiments on various datasets including mnist, ashionmnist, cifar-10, cifar-100, tiny imagenet, and imdb by training complex-valued convolutional neural networks. the spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and the corresponding p-values on these datasets provide strong proof of the statistically significant correlation between the spectral complexity of a network and its generalisation ability, as measured by the spectral norm product of the weight matrices. the code is available at https://github .com /leaveslei /cvnn _ generalization.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( .org /licenses /by-nc -nd /4 .0/).",AB_0100
"with the advent of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and in situ rna sequencing technologies, spatial transcriptomics analysis is advancing rapidly, providing spatial location and gene expression information about cells in tissue sections at single cell resolution. cell type classification of these spatially-resolved cells can be inferred by matching the spatial transcriptomics data to reference atlases derived from single cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) in which cell types are defined by differences in their gene expression profiles. however, robust cell type matching of the spatially-resolved cells to reference scrna-seq atlases is challenging due to the intrinsic differences in resolution between the spatial and scrna-seq data. in this study, we systematically evaluated six computational algorithms for cell type matching across four image-based spatial transcriptomics experimental protocols (merfish, smfish, baristaseq, and exseq) conducted on the same mouse primary visual cortex (visp) brain region. we find that many cells are assigned as the same type by multiple cell type matching algorithms and are present in spatial patterns previously reported from scrna-seq studies in visp. furthermore, by combining the results of individual matching strategies into consensus cell type assignments, we see even greater alignment with biological expectations. we present two ensemble meta-analysis strategies used in this study and share the consensus cell type matching results in the cytosplore viewer (https://viewer.cytosplore.org) for interactive visualization and data exploration. the consensus matching can also guide spatial data analysis using ssam, allowing segmentation-free cell type assignment.",AB_0100
"following unprecedented success on the natural language tasks, transformers have been successfully applied to several computer vision problems, achieving state-of-the-art results and prompting researchers to reconsider the supremacy of convolutional neural networks (cnns) as de facto operators. capitalizing on these advances in computer vision, the medical imaging field has also witnessed growing interest for transformers that can capture global context compared to cnns with local receptive fields. inspired from this transition, in this survey, we attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the applications of transformers in medical imaging covering various aspects, ranging from recently proposed architectural designs to unsolved issues. specifically, we survey the use of transformers in medical image segmentation, detection, classification, restoration, synthesis, registration, clinical report generation, and other tasks. in particular, for each of these applications, we develop taxonomy, identify application-specific challenges as well as provide insights to solve them, and highlight recent trends. further, we provide a critical discussion of the field's current state as a whole, including the identification of key challenges, open problems, and outlining promising future directions. we hope this survey will ignite further interest in the community and provide researchers with an up-to-date reference regarding applications of transformer models in medical imaging. finally, to cope with the rapid development in this field, we intend to regularly update the relevant latest papers and their open-source implementations at https://github.com/fahadshamshad/awesome-transformers-in-medical-imaging.",AB_0100
"intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc), including the first global stocktake under the paris agreement that will conclude at cop28 in december 2023. evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. however, successive ipcc reports are published at intervals of 5-10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. we follow methods as close as possible to those used in the ipcc sixth assessment report (ar6) working group one (wgi) report. we compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, surface temperature changes, the earth's energy imbalance, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. the purpose of this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192, smith et al., 2023a). as they are traceable to ipcc report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in unfccc negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. the indicators show that human-induced warming reached 1.14 [0.9 to 1.4] degrees c averaged over the 2013-2022 decade and 1.26 [1.0 to 1.6] degrees c in 2022. over the 2013-2022 period, human-induced warming has been increasing at an unprecedented rate of over 0.2 ffi c per decade. this high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 +/- 5.3 gtco(2)e over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. despite this, there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for human influence on climate.",AB_0100
"human activity recognition is an essential task for human-centered intelligent systems such as healthcare and smart vehicles, which can be accomplished by analyzing time-series signals collected from sensors in wearable devices. in these applications, real-time response is vital because prompt action is necessary for urgent events such as an elderly person falling or driving while drowsy. although recurrent neural networks have been widely used owing to their temporal modeling capabilities, recent studies have focused on convolutional neural networks (cnns) that are suitable for real-time responses because they incur lower computational costs. however, cnns with a manual design may fail to achieve optimal accuracy due to varying computational budgets with applications or devices. in this paper, we propose a novel design framework that uses a mathematical approach to derive a cnn architecture suitable for a given computational budget. as a result, we introduce a grouped temporal shift network (gtsnet) with the network architecture to be flexibly modified by predefining the theoretical computation cost. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments, achieving the best performance for well-known public benchmark datasets under limited computational budgets. the source codes of the gtsnet are publicly available at https://github.com/ jgpark92/gtsnet.",AB_0100
"understanding the human-object interactions (hois) from a video is essential to fully comprehend a visual scene. this line of research has been addressed by detecting hois from images and lately from videos. however, the video-based hoi anticipation task in the third-person view remains understudied. in this paper, we design a framework to detect current hois and anticipate future hois in videos. we propose to leverage human gaze information since people often fixate on an object before interacting with it. these gaze features together with the scene contexts and the visual appearances of human-object pairs are fused through a spatio-temporal transformer. to evaluate the model in the hoi anticipation task in a multi-person scenario, we propose a set of person-wise multi-label metrics. our model is trained and validated on the vidhoi dataset, which contains videos capturing daily life and is currently the largest video hoi dataset. experimental results in the hoi detection task show that our approach improves the baseline by a great margin of 36.3% relatively. moreover, we conduct an extensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our modifications and extensions to the spatio-temporal transformer. our code is publicly available on https://github.com/nizhf/hoi-prediction-gaze-transformer.",AB_0100
"hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms are an important and popular branch of machine learning in the construction of classifiers using fuzzy sets and logic theory and neural network architectures. this type of learning is characterised by many strong points of modern predictors such as a high scalability, explainability, online adaptation, effective learning from a small amount of data, native ability to deal with missing data and accommodating new classes. nevertheless, there is no comprehensive existing package for hyperbox-based machine learning which can serve as a benchmark for research and allow non-expert users to apply these algorithms easily. the hyperboxbrain is an open-source python library implementing the leading hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms. this library exposes a unified api which closely follows and is compatible with the renowned scikit-learn and numpy toolboxes. the library may be installed from python package index (pypi) and the conda package manager and is distributed under the gpl-3 license. the source code, documentation, detailed tutorials, and the full descriptions of the api are available at https://utscaslab.github.io/hyperbox-brain.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0100
"background: autonomy-supportive health environments can assist patients in achieving behavior change and can influence adherence positively. telerehabilitation may increase access to rehabilitation services, but creating an autonomy-supportive environment may be challenging.research question: to what degree does telerehabilitation provide an autonomy-supportive environment? what is the patient experience of an 8-week telerehabilitation program?study design and methods: individuals undertaking telerehabilitation or center-based pulmonary rehabilitation within a larger randomized controlled equivalence trial completed the health care climate questionnaire (hccq; short form) to assess perceived autonomy support. telerehabilitation participants were invited 1:1 to undertake semi -structured interviews. interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded thematically to identify major themes and subthemes.results: one hundred thirty-six participants (n = 69 telerehabilitation) completed the hccq and 30 telerehabilitation participants (42%) undertook interviews. hccq summary scores indicated that participants strongly agreed that the telerehabilitation environment was au-tonomy supportive, which was similar to center-based participants (hccq summary score, p = .6; individual hccq items, p $ .3). telerehabilitation interview data supported quanti-tative findings identifying five major themes, with subthemes, as follows: (1) making it easier to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation, because telerehabilitation was convenient, saved time and money, and offered flexibility; (2) receiving support in a variety of ways, including op-portunities for peer support and receiving an individualized program guided by expert staff; (3) internal and external motivation to exercise as a consequence of being in a supervised group, seeing results for effort, and being inspired by others; (4) achieving success through provision of equipment and processes to prepare and support operation of equipment and technology; and (5) after the rehabilitation program, continuing to exercise, but dealing with feelings of loss.interpretation: telerehabilitation was perceived as an autonomy-supportive environment, in part by making it easier to undertake pulmonary rehabilitation. support for behavior change, understanding, and motivation were derived from clinicians and patient-peers. the extent to which autonomy support translates into ongoing self-management and behavior change is not clear.trial registry: australian and new zealand clinical trials registry; no.: actrn12616000360415; url: https://anzctr.org.au/ chest 2023; 163(6):1410-1424",AB_0100
"demand for food products, often from international trade, has brought agricultural land use into direct competition with biodiversity. where these potential conflicts occur and which consumers are responsible is poorly understood. by combining conservation priority (cp) maps with agricultural trade data, we estimate current potential conservation risk hotspots driven by 197 countries across 48 agricultural products. globally, a third of agricultural production occurs in sites of high cp (cp > 0.75, max = 1.0). while cattle, maize, rice, and soybean pose the greatest threat to very high-cp sites, other low-conservation risk products (e.g., sugar beet, pearl millet, and sunflower) currently are less likely to be grown in sites of agriculture-conservation conflict. our analysis suggests that a commodity can cause dissimilar conservation threats in different production regions. accordingly, some of the conservation risks posed by different countries depend on their demand and sourcing patterns of agricultural commodities. our spatial analyses identify potential hotspots of competition between agriculture and high-conservation value sites (i.e., 0.5 degrees resolution, or similar to 367 to 3,077km(2), grid cells containing both agriculture and high-biodiversity priority habitat), thereby providing additional information that could help prioritize conservation activities and safeguard biodiversity in individual countries and globally. a web-based gis tool at https://agriculture.spatialfootprint. com/biodiversity/ systematically visualizes the results of our analyses.",AB_0100
"for inverse qsar/qspr in conventional molecular design,severalchemical structures must be generated and their molecular descriptorsmust be calculated. however, there is no one-to-one correspondencebetween the generated chemical structures and molecular descriptors.in this paper, molecular descriptors, structure generation, and inverseqsar/qspr based on self-referencing embedded strings (selfies), a100% robust molecular string representation, are proposed. a one-hotvector is converted from selfies to selfies descriptors x, and an inverse analysis of the qsar/qspr model y = f(x) with the objective variable y and molecular descriptor x is conducted.thus, x values that achieve a target y value are obtained. based on these values, selfies strings or moleculesare generated, meaning that inverse qsar/qspr is performed successfully.the selfies descriptors and selfies-based structure generation areverified using datasets of actual compounds. the successful constructionof selfies-descriptor-based qsar/qspr models with predictive abilitiescomparable to those of models based on other fingerprints is confirmed.a large number of molecules with one-to-one relationships with thevalues of the selfies descriptors are generated. furthermore, as acase study of inverse qsar/qspr, molecules with target y values are generated successfully. the python code for the proposedmethod is available at https://github.com/hkaneko1985/dcekit.",AB_0100
