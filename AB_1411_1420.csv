"background: colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency is usually less aggressive and associated with a lower risk of distant metastasis. immune checkpoint inhibition, rather than traditional chemoradiotherapy, has shown great advantages in treating such patients. objective: this study aimed to verify the hypothesis that locally very advanced (t4b) colorectal cancer without distant metastases might present with higher probability of mismatch repair deficiency and be more sensitive to neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition. design: this study was designed as a single-center retrospective observational study. settings: the study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in china. patients: the study included patients who were clinically diagnosed with t4bm0 colorectal cancer from 2008 to 2019. main outcome measures: clinicopathological characteristics, mismatch repair status, and survival outcomes of patients with mismatch repair deficiency were analyzed. results: a total of 268 patients were included. the incidence of patients with mismatch repair deficiency in the t4bm0 population was 27.6% (75/268), with 84.0% (63/75) in the colon and 16.0% (12/75) in the rectum. for tumors located in the proximal colon, 45.0% (50/111) exhibited mismatch repair deficiency, whereas the incidence of mismatch repair deficiency in sigmoid colon cancer and rectal cancer was only 15.9% (25/157). neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition significantly reduced the open surgery rate (p = 0.000) and multivisceral resection rate (p = 0.025). the pathological complete remission rate in the neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition group was significantly higher than that in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy/chemotherapy group (70.0% vs 0%; p = 0.004). no tumor downstaging was observed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition provided significantly better disease-free survival (p = 0.0078) and relatively longer overall survival (p = 0.15) than other groups. limitations: this study is limited by the possible selection bias and small sample size. conclusions: our data depicted the high incidence of mismatch repair deficiency in t4bm0 mismatch repair deficiency and the effectiveness of the neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition group in organ preservation. precision oncology requires identification of the protein status of mismatch repair at initial diagnosis to make a rational treatment decision for these patients. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b952.",AB_0142
"in recent years, light detection and ranging (lidar) has been widely used in the intelligent traffic system due to its high-precision data acquisition capabilities. it has great potential for accurately detecting and tracking vehicle trajectories on the roadside. this study aims to develop a novel methodological framework for accurate vehicle trajectory extraction from roadside lidar. the proposed method starts by designing a detection area, followed by the application of statistical filtering, density clustering, and a random sample consensus (ransac) segmentation algorithm to eliminate the background point cloud. subsequently, a modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with a noise algorithm (bso-dbscan) is employed to detect the vehicle based on a beetle swarm optimization algorithm. an oriented bounding box (obb) is used to obtain vehicle position, length, and width. a modified trajectory association method based on the kalman filtering algorithm is proposed to address vehicle occlusion. lidar is deployed to obtain vehicle operation data in the expressway work zone, and the performance of the proposed method is tested using an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav). the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully extracts high-precision vehicle trajectories. specif-ically, the vehicle recognition accuracy increased by 12.7% in mape and 14.9% in rmse compared to dbscan. the trajectory tracking accuracy increased by 13.5%, and the number of id switching (id-sw) was reduced by 271 times compared to sort. the vehicle trajectory data extracted in this study provides a foundation for traffic characteristic analysis and traffic modeling. the extracted data can be downloaded from the following github: https://github.com/gao0628/dataset.",AB_0142
"accurate segmentation of retinal fundus vessel images is vital to clinical diagnosis. due to the intricate vascular morphology, high noise and low contrast of fundus vessel images, retinal fundus vessel segmentation is still a challenging task, especially for thin vessel segmentation. in recent years, on account of strong context feature extraction ability of deep learning, it has shown a remarkable performance in the automatic segmentation of retinal fundus vessels. however, it still exhibits certain limitations, such as information loss on micro objects or details, inadequate treatment of local features, etc. faced with these challenging factors, we present a new multi-scale global attention network (mga-net). to realize effective feature representation, a dense attention u-net network is proposed. meanwhile, we design a global context attention (gca) block to realize multi-scale feature fusion, allowing the global features from the deep network layers to flow to the shallow network layers. further, aimed at retinal fundus vessel segmentation task again the class imbalance issue, the ag block is also introduced. related experiments are conducted on chase_db1, drive and stare datasets to show the effectiveness of proposed segmentation model. the experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method with ft exceeding 82% on all three datasets and effectively improve the segmentation performance of thin vessels. the source code of proposed mga-net is available at https://github.com/gegao310/workspace.git.",AB_0142
"backgrounddespite major advances in cancer therapeutics, the therapeutic options of lung squamous cell carcinoma (lscc)-specific remain limited. furthermore, the current staging system is imperfect for defining a prognosis and guiding treatment due to its simplicity and heterogeneity. we sought to develop prognostic decision tools for individualized survival prediction and treatment optimization in elderly patients with lscc.methodsclinical data of 4564 patients (stageib-iiib) diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 were extracted from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database for prognostic nomograms development. the proposed models were externally validated using a separate group consisting of 1299 patients (stage ib-iiib) diagnosed from 2012-2015 in china. the prognostic performance was measured using the concordance index (c-index), calibration curves, the average time-dependent area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (auc), and decision curve analysis.resultseleven candidate prognostic variables were identified by the univariable and multivariable cox regression analysis. the calibration curves showed satisfactory agreement between the actual and nomogram-estimated lung cancer-specific survival (lcss) rates. by calculating the c-indices and average auc, our nomograms presented a higher prognostic accuracy than the current staging system. clinical usefulness was revealed by the decision curve analysis. user-friendly online decision tools integrating proposed nomograms were created to estimate survival for patients with different treatment regimens.conclusionsthe decision tools for individualized survival prediction and treatment optimization might facilitate clinicians with decision-making, medical teaching, and experimental design. online tools are expected to be integrated into clinical practice by using the freely available website (https://loyal-brand-611803.framer.app/).",AB_0142
"the potential impact of a paper is often quantified by how many citations it will receive. however, most commonly used models may underestimate the influence of newly published papers over time, and fail to encapsulate this dynamics of citation network into the graph. in this study, we construct hierarchical and heterogeneous graphs for target papers with an annual perspective. the constructed graphs can record the annual dynamics of target papers' scientific context information. then, a novel graph neural network, hierarchical and heterogeneous contrastive graph learning model (h2cgl), is proposed to incorporate heterogeneity and dynamics of the citation network. h2cgl separately aggregates the heterogeneous information for each year and prioritizes the highly-cited papers and relationships among references, citations, and the target paper. it then employs a weighted gin to capture dynamics between heterogeneous subgraphs over years. moreover, it leverages contrastive learning to make the graph representations more sensitive to potential citations. in particular, co-cited or co-citing papers of the target paper with large citation gaps are taken as hard negative samples, while randomly dropping low-cited papers could generate positive samples. extensive experimental results on two scholarly datasets demonstrate that the proposed h2 cgl significantly outperforms a series of baseline approaches for both previously and freshly published papers. additional analyses highlight the significance of the proposed modules. our codes and settings have been released on github.

"knowledge distillation is an emerging method for acquiring efficient, small-scale networks. the main idea is to transfer knowledge from a complex teacher model with high learning capacity to a simple student model. to this end, various approaches to knowledge distillation have been proposed in the past few years, focusing mainly on modifications to student learning styles and less on changes to teacher teaching styles. therefore, our new approach to knowledge distillation teacher training involves adapting the trained teachers to the knowledge distillation model in order to minimize the gap between the student model and the teacher model. we introduced the idea of a trained teacher: our approach involves using a specially trained teacher network that, by incorporating knowledge distillation constraints during its own training, adapts to the teaching model in advance and performs nearly identically to a typical teacher network. this allows students to absorb the teacher's knowledge more effectively, thereby increasing their competence. in addition, the methods of mainstream knowledge distillation currently in use are equally appropriate to our educated teachers. extensive tests on numerous datasets reveal that our technique outperforms the original knowledge distillation in accuracy on standard kd by 2%. our code and pre-trained models can be found at https://github.com/jsj515-group/traine d_teacher.",AB_0142
"background: upper limb function reconstruction has been an important issue in the field of stroke rehabilitation. due to the complexity of upper extremity dysfunction in stroke patients, the clinical efficacy produced by central or peripheral stimulation alone is limited. for this reason, our group has proposed acupuncture synchronized rehabilitation therapy (asrt), i.e., simultaneous scalp acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture during rehabilitation. pre-experiments results showed that this therapy can effectively improve the motor and sensory functions of upper limbs in post-stroke patients, but the clinical efficacy and safety of asrt need to be further verified, and whether there is a synergistic effect between scalp acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture also needs to be studied in depth. therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of different therapies to explore a more scientific synchronous treatment model. methods: this is a single-center, randomized controlled trial using a 2 x 2 factorial design. we will recruit 136 stroke survivors with upper extremity dysfunction and randomize them into four groups (n = 34). all subjects will undergo routine treatment, based on which the experimental group 1: rehabilitation training synchronized with intradermal acupuncture treatment of the affected upper limb; experimental group 2: rehabilitation training of the affected upper limb synchronized with focal-side scalp acupuncture treatment, and experimental group 3: rehabilitation training synchronized with intradermal acupuncture treatment of the affected upper limb synchronized with focal-side scalp acupuncture treatment; control group: rehabilitation training of the affected upper limb only. the intervention will last for 4 weeks, 5 times a week. both acupuncture treatments will be performed according to the revised standards for reporting interventions in clinical trials of acupuncture (stricta). the primary outcome indicators for this trial are fugl-meyer assessment-upper extremity and somatosensory evoked potential. secondary outcome indicators include wolf motor function test, upper extremity function test, revised nottingham sensory assessment scale, diffusion tensor imaging, and modified barthel index. the incidence of adverse events will be used as the indicator of safety. discussion: the study will provide high-quality clinical evidence on whether asrt improves upper limb motor and sensory function and activities of daily living (adl) in stroke patients, and determine whether scalp acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture have synergistic effects. clinical trial registration: https://www.chictr.org.cn/, chinese clinical trial registry [chictr2200066646].",AB_0142
"automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. however, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. in this paper, we propose a medical knowledge with contrastive learning model (mkcl) to enhance radiology report generation. the proposed model mkcl uses iu medical knowledge graph (iu-mkg) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. in particular, we design knowledge enhanced attention (kea), which integrates the iu-mkg and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. experimental results on the public dataset iu x-ray show that our proposed model mkcl outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods. ablation studies also demonstrate that iu medical knowledge graph module and supervised contrastive learning module enhance the ability of the model to detect the abnormal parts and accurately describe the abnormal findings. the source code is available at: https://github.com/ eleanorhxd/mkcl.",AB_0142
"few-shot video classification methods aim to recognize a new class with only a few training examples. distinct from previous few-shot methods, we explicitly consider the relations in cross-video domains and take full advantage of the cross-video frame matching in a hierarchy learning fashion. in this paper, we propose a dualhierarchy graph neural network to realize comprehensive cross-video frame matching and video relation modeling. in the first hierarchy of the graph neural network, we build a cross-video frame matching graph to extract robust frame-level features via accumulating information across frames sampled from both query and support videos. then, frame representations are accumulated to obtain the video-level features. in the second hierarchy of the graph neural network, we construct a video relation graph by taking the video-level features as nodes, which can adaptively learn positive relations between query and support videos. we get the predicted label of the query video through the matching learning of edges connecting video nodes. we evaluate the model on three benchmarks: hmdb51, kinetics, and ucf101. extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model significantly improves few-shot video classification across a wide range of competitive baselines and showcases the strong generalization of our framework. the source code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/jiamingzhong2621/dhgnn.",AB_0142
"deep learning-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in the field of synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (sar atr). however, obtaining a sufficient number of labeled sar images remains a significant challenge that can negatively affect the performance of these methods. this is because most deep learning models use the entire target image as input. however, but research has shown that with limited training data, the model may not be able to capture discriminative regions of the image. instead, they might focus on more useless even harmful image regions for recognition, leading to poor recognition results. in this study, we propose a novel sar atr framework that addresses the limitation of limited training data. the proposed framework primarily comprises a global assisted branch, locally enhanced branch, feature capture module, and feature discrimination module. the global-assisted branch conducts an initial recognition and provides a loss based on the entire sar image during each training epoch and the feature capture module automatically segments and captures crucial image regions for current recognition, which we refer to as the golden keyof the image. the local enhanced branch then performs another recognition and provides another loss function based on the image parts. instead of updating the model with two basic recognition losses to roughly search for and capture crucial image parts, a feature discrimination module is proposed to combine the global and local branches in a subtle manner to improve local feature separability or compactness for similar inter-class or dissimilar inner-class sample pairs in global features. this adaptively forced the model to capture more crucial image parts and extract more effective features. experimental results and comparisons of the mstar and opensarship datasets indicated that the proposed method achieves superior recognition performance compared to existing methods. the effectiveness of our method was further demonstrated through the visualization of the golden key of the testing images and the recognition performance in ablation experiments. we will release our codes and more experimental results at https://github.com/cwwangsaratr/saratr_feacapture_discrimination.",AB_0142
