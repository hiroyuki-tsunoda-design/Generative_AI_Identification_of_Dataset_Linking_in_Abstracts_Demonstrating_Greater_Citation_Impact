"objectives: we explored whether a new combination of eye mask sleep position therapy (spt) and oral appliance therapy (oat) was more effective at treating positional obstructive sleep apnea (posa) than was the use of either device alone.methods: in this randomized controlled trial, 60 posa subjects diagnosed by standard polysomnography (psg) were divided into three groups (ratio 1:1:1): spt, oat, and spt combined with oat (sot). participants underwent hospital-based follow-ups during months 1 and 6 after beginning treatment. the primary outcome was the decline in the apnea hypopnea index (ahi) at month 6. the secondary outcomes were changes in oxygen-derived parameters and the curative effect at month 6.results: after 6 months of treatment, psg showed that spt, oat, and sot all improved the ahi and oxygen-derived parameters. the ahi decline was significantly better in the sot group than in the oat or spt group (71.58% [50.56-84.84%] for sot, 44.42% [21.23-67.52%] for oat, and 33.24% [19.03-54.62%] for spt at 6 months) (p = 0.018 and p < 0.001 for the comparisons of sot with oat and sot with spt, respectively). in terms of oxygen-derived parameters, only the sleep apnea-specific hypoxic burden (sashb) improved more in the sot group (76.89% [57.43-85.91%]) than in the other groups (44.73% [32.38-72.69%] for oat and 41.82% [15.40-65.24%] for spt, p = 0.002 and p < 0.001 for the comparisons of sot with oat and sot with spt, respectively). the efficacies of spt, oat, and sot were 36.84%, 50%, and 80% at 6 months; the sot group evidenced the highest value (rate ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.78 (1.05-3.03), p = 0.048 and 2.17 (1.16-4.07), p = 0.010, for the comparisons of sot with oat and sot with spt, respectively).conclusion: the combination of spt and oat was better than either treatment alone and may represent a good option for the treatment of posa. trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry; url: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx? proj=42,852; no. chictr1900025584.(c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0198
"protein 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutarylation (hmgylation) is newly discovered lysine acylation modification in mitochondrion. the accurate identification of hmgylation sites is the premise and key to further explore the molecular mechanisms of hmgylation. in this study, a novel bioinformatics tool named hmgpred is developed to predict hmgylation sites. multiple effective features, including amino acid composition, amino acid factors, binary encoding, and the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs, are integrated to encode hmgylation sites. and f-score feature ranking with incremental feature selection was used to eliminate redundant features. moreover, a fuzzy support vector machine algorithm is used to effectively reduce the influence of noise problem by assigning different samples to different fuzzy membership degrees. as illustrated by 10-fold cross-validation, hmgpred achieves a satisfactory performance with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9110. feature analysis indicates that some k-spaced amino acid pair features, such as 'kxxxt' and 'dxxxe', play a critical role in the prediction of hmgylation sites. the results of prediction and analysis might be helpful for investigating the mechanisms of hmgylation. for the convenience of experimental researchers, hmgpred is implemented as a web server at http://123.206.31.171/hmgpred/.",AB_0198
"contrastive adversarial training has successfully improved the robustness of contrastive learning (cl). however, the robustness metric in these methods depends on attack algorithms, image labels, and downstream tasks, introducing reliability concerns. to address these issues, this paper proposes a novel robustness verification framework for contrastive learning (rvcl). specifically, we define the verification problem of cl from deterministic and probabilistic perspectives, then provide several effective metrics to evaluate the robustness of cl encoder. furthermore, we use extreme value theory to reveal the relationship between the robust radius of the cl encoder and that of the supervised downstream task. extensive experiments on various benchmark models and datasets validate theoretical findings, and further demonstrate rvcl's capability to evaluate the robustness of both cl encoders and images. our code is available at https://github.com/wzekai99/rvcl-jmlr.",AB_0198
"the neutral line, a crucial feature found in sky light polarization pattern images, plays a crucial role in bio-inspired polarization navigation. however, current methods for detecting the neutral line typically assume clear and unobstructed conditions. unfortunately, the sky polarization pattern (spp) is susceptible to various weather conditions and geographic environments, leading to distorted patterns caused by random occlusions. consequently, accurately determining the orientation information of the neutral line becomes challenging. to address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the distribution characteristics of the neutral line in the spp using both simulation and real measurement experiments. in addition, we curate a comprehensive dataset known as the spp dataset. leveraging an adversarial learning-based approach, we propose a novel method for reconstructing spp images. subsequently, we perform neutral line detection on the reconstructed spps. notably, our method showcases exceptional performance in detecting neutral lines, even in the presence of up to 80% occlusions within the area of interest. experimental evaluations, conducted on both simulated and measured spps, validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. furthermore, quantitative analyses of the experimental results confirm the stability and reliability of our approach. our work makes a valuable contribution to the field of spp reconstruction and neutral line detection under complex conditions. moreover, it holds significant potential for advancing the measurement and application of polarization techniques. data and models are available at: https://github.com/wnci.",AB_0198
"given the potential diminishment of semantic information caused by previous nonregion-specific maximum or weighted intensity losses under different lighting conditions, we propose a novel high-level semantic perception fusion framework, termed semantic region adaptive fusion (srafusion). we establish a prioritized preservation scheme for high-level semantic information (hlsi), gradient information, and intensity information, ranked in descending order of priority. based on this prioritization scheme and prior knowledge of semantic distribution in the source images, we construct a ground truth for the fusion task. specifically, we capture the hlsi distribution of the source images using two independent semantic segmentation networks. subsequently, we introduce semantic region decision block (srdb) to partition the original scene into region with bimodal hlsi, region with unimodal hlsi, and region lacking hlsi. we then design specific loss functions to constrain the aforementioned regions, facilitating the integration of complete semantic information. furthermore, taking into account the susceptibility of the visible segmentation network to lighting conditions, we use a two-stage training strategy involving coarse-tuning and fine-tuning. this method aims to optimize one-stage training strategy and achieve a more accurate region delineation. finally, qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on publicly available datasets such as mfnet, roadscene, and tno demonstrate the superiority of our srafusion over state-of-the-art methods. our code will be available: https://github.com/wenzicao/srafusion.",AB_0198
"polyglyphanodontians were a dominant terrestrial lizard group during the cretaceous. they were mainly distributed across laurasia but show their greatest diversity in the upper cretaceous deposits of china and mongolia. several of the asian taxa were comparatively large, with robust skulls and a dentition specialized for herbivory. two polyglyphanodontian genera, tianyusaurus from china and polyglyphanodon from north america, are unusual in having developed a complete, or near complete, lower temporal bar. here we describe a third polyglyphanodontian with a complete lower temporal bar, yechilacerta yingliangia gen. et sp. nov., from the upper cretaceous of jiangxi province, southern china. these deposits have also yielded specimens of tianyusaurus, but the new genus differs from tianyusaurus in several key aspects of skull and dental morphology, including the presence of coarse pustulate cranial sculpture, and the absence of maxillary caniniform teeth. phylogenetic analysis places the new genus and species as the sister taxon to tianyusaurus, with both taxa nested among east asian gilmoreteiids. previous phylogenetic analyses using morphological characters have mostly placed polyglyphanodontians close to extant teiioid lizards, but our analyses, using a constraint tree for squamates based on published molecular phylogenies, placed polyglyphanodontia closer to iguania. however, a more comprehensive review is needed to resolve their relationships.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:53b9ce04-e600-48ae-ac98-7476a949bcbd",AB_0198
"meta learning has attracted much attention recently in machine learning community. contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent prediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to learn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as to generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning methodology. in this study, we achieve such learning methodology by learning an explicit hyper-parameter prediction function shared by all training tasks, and we call this learning process as simulating learning methodology (slem). specifically, this function is represented as a parameterized function called meta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyper-parameter setting, extracted from a prespecified function set called meta learning machine. such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is able to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed hyper-parameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability to query task's variations. such understanding of meta learning also makes it easily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its generalization bounds code of our method is released at https://github.com/xjtushujun/slem-theory.",AB_0198
"introduction: whole transcriptome analysis found substantial variations in butyrophilin-like 9 (btnl9) expression between osteosarcoma (os) and healthy bone tissues. the biological involvement of btnl9 in the physiological regulation of os cells and its underlying mechanism were investigated herein.methods: cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis were evaluated to determine the influence of btnl9 on the malignant phenotypes of os cells. given that the string (https://string-db.org/) database analysis indicated a potential association between btnl9 and ras homolog family member b (rhob), co-immunoprecipitation (co-ip) was performed to confirm their relationship. to verify the role of rhob, it was knocked down, and the impacts on the above aspects, as well as the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/akt serine/threonine kinase (pi3k/akt) signaling pathway, were evaluated.results: btnl9 plays a negative role in os cells, manifested as inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis and promotion of apoptosis. co-ip results demonstrated a direct association between btnl9 and rhob. rhob knockdown partially reversed the regulatory effect of btnl9 on the malignant phenotypes of os cells and the pi3k/akt signaling pathway.conclusion: this study highlights that btnl9 acts as a tumor suppressor in os and alleviates several malignant phenotypes. btnl9 collaborates with the recognized tumor suppressor rhob to block the pi3k/akt signaling pathway, which is one of the regulatory mechanisms.",AB_0198
"line segment detection is the basis for various visual measurement tasks. numerous methods have been proposed to detect line segments from images, and edge-fitting-based ones have gained significant attention because of their remarkable detection efficiency. however, most edge-fitting-based methods primarily rely on gradient magnitude for edge detection and edge coordinates for line segment fitting, neglecting the importance of considering gradient orientation, which may reduce their effectiveness. in addition, most of them require the least squares for line segment fitting, involving the computationally inefficient squaring operation. to solve the above issues, this study proposes an effective and efficient line segment detection (e2lsd) algorithm based on two new findings regarding the level line of edge points, i.e., the unit vector orthogonal to the corresponding gradient orientation. 1) utilizing double consistent constraints of both coordinates and level lines of edge points to fit line segments results in a more effective line segment detection than those relying on a single consistent constraint of coordinates. 2) decoupling line segment orientation and position, followed by fitting them separately using level lines and coordinates of edge points, results in a computationally efficient line segment detection approach. it is more computationally efficient than those directly fitting line segments in the least squares sense based on the coordinates of edge points. in the e2lsd algorithm, edges are drawn with the guideline of level lines to improve accuracy. numerical experiments based on natural and synthetic datasets showed that the e2lsd algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art (sota) methods regarding both effectiveness and computational efficiency. the e2lsd algorithm has also successfully been employed in a visual measurement system regarding feature-based visual localization. the code of the e2lsd algorithm will be publicly available at https://github.com/roylin1229/e2lsd.",AB_0198
"single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technology studies transcriptome and cell-to-cell differences from higher single-cell resolution and different perspectives. despite the advantage of high capture efficiency, downstream functional analysis of scrna-seq data is made difficult by the excess of zero values (i.e., the dropout phenomenon). to effectively address this problem, we introduced scntimpute, an imputation framework based on a neural topic model. a neural network encoder is used to extract underlying topic features of single-cell transcriptome data to infer high-quality cell similarity. at the same time, we determine which transcriptome data are affected by the dropout phenomenon according to the learning of the mixture model by the neural network. on the basis of stable cell similarity, the same gene information in other similar cells is borrowed to impute only the missing expression values. by evaluating the performance of real data, scntimpute can accurately and efficiently identify the dropout values and imputes them accurately. in the meantime, the clustering of cell subsets is improved and the original biological information in cell clustering is solved, which is covered by technical noise. the source code for the scntimpute module is available as open source at https://github.com/qiyueyang-7/scntimpute.git.",AB_0198
