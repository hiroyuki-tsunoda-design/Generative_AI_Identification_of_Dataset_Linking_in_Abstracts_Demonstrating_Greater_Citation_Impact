"motivation numerous high-accuracy drug-target affinity (dta) prediction models, whose performance is heavily reliant on the drug and target feature information, are developed at the expense of complexity and interpretability. feature extraction and optimization constitute a critical step that significantly influences the enhancement of model performance, robustness, and interpretability. many existing studies aim to comprehensively characterize drugs and targets by extracting features from multiple perspectives; however, this approach has drawbacks: (i) an abundance of redundant or noisy features; and (ii) the feature sets often suffer from high dimensionality.results in this study, to obtain a model with high accuracy and strong interpretability, we utilize various traditional and cutting-edge feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to process self-associated features and adjacent associated features. these optimized features are then fed into learning to rank to achieve efficient dta prediction. extensive experimental results on two commonly used datasets indicate that, among various feature optimization methods, the regression tree-based feature selection method is most beneficial for constructing models with good performance and strong robustness. then, by utilizing shapley additive explanations values and the incremental feature selection approach, we obtain that the high-quality feature subset consists of the top 150d features and the top 20d features have a breakthrough impact on the dta prediction. in conclusion, our study thoroughly validates the importance of feature optimization in dta prediction and serves as inspiration for constructing high-performance and high-interpretable models.availability and implementation https://github.com/ruxiaoqing964914140/fs_dta.",AB_0078
"recently, contrastive learning has gained popularity in the field of unsupervised image-to-image (i2i) translation. in a previous study, a query-selected attention (qs-attn) module, which employed an attention matrix with a probability distribution, was used to maximize the mutual information between the source and translated images. this module selected significant queries using an entropy metric computed from the attention matrix. however, it often selected many queries with equal significance measures, leading to an excessive focus on the background. in this study, we proposed a dual-learning framework with qs-attn and convolutional block attention module (cbam) called object-stable dual contrastive learning generative adversarial network (os-dclgan). in this paper, we utilize a cbam, which learns what and where to emphasize or suppress, thereby refining intermediate features effectively. this cbam was integrated before the qs-attn module to capture significant domain information for i2i translation tasks. the proposed framework outperformed recently introduced approaches in various i2i translation tasks, showing its effectiveness and versatility. the code is available at https://github.com/redpotatochip/osudl",AB_0078
"backgroundchemoradiotherapy (crt) with concurrent cisplatin is the standard of care as a nonsurgical definitive treatment for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (la-scchn). however, crt is associated with increased severe late adverse events, including swallowing dysfunction, xerostomia, ototoxicity, and hypothyroidism. few strategies aimed at less invasive crt without compromising treatment outcomes have been successful. the purpose of this study is to confirm the non-inferiority of reduced dose prophylactic radiation with 40 gy compared to standard dose prophylactic radiation with 56 gy in terms of the time to treatment failure (ttf) among patients with clinical stage iii-ivb la-scchn.methodsthis study is a multicenter, two-arm, open-label, randomized phase iii trial. patients with la-scchn excluding p16 positive oropharynx cancer are randomized to the standard arm or experimental arm. a total dose of 70 gy for tumors with concurrent cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 are administered in both arms. for prophylactic field, patients in the standard arm receive a total dose of 56 gy in 35 fractions for 7 weeks using simultaneous integrated boost (sib56) and those in the experimental arm receive 40 gy in 20 fractions using two-step methods for 4 weeks (2-step40). a total of 400 patients will be enrolled from 52 japanese institutions within 5 years. the primary endpoint is ttf, and the secondary endpoints are overall survival, complete response rate, progression-free survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, acute and late adverse events, quality of life score, and swallowing function score.discussionif the experimental arm is non-inferior to the standard arm in terms of ttf and superior on the safety endpoints, the 2-step40 procedure is the more useful treatment than sib56 for definitive crt.trial registrationthis trial has been registered in the japan registry of clinical trials as jrcts031210100 (https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jrcts031210100). date of registration: may 2021.",AB_0078
"water pollution and climate change are among the greatest threats to the iconic great barrier reef (gbr). to improve the gbr's long-term outlook, making improvements on these fronts is required. owing to the complex interactions between soils, climate, and farm management, a tool is needed to guide agricultural land managers about which management practice changes are more likely to deliver improved water quality and climate resilience outcomes whilst maintaining profitability. using concepts drawn from social studies of science and technology, a 'discussion' support system (dss) named irrigation rapid assessment tool (i-rat) was developed through participatory processes designed to enhance co-learning from the development of this dss. i-rat is a rapid assessment-visualisation tool in an interactive web application (https://i-rat.net) to visualise the impacts of changed irrigation practices for sugarcane farmers and extension staff. specifically, i-rat compares these impacts regarding farm economics, water quality, productivity, carbon and nitrogen cycles, and greenhouse gas emission. the core of i-rat is the sugarcane module from the agricultural production systems simulator (apsim) modelling platform. i-rat was first developed for the burdekin sugarcane growing region in queensland (australia's largest sugarcane producing region). various soil types and management scenarios representing farming practices in the burdekin region were used for simulations (1971-2021) to generate a datacube. in this paper, we describe how fundamental learnings about more (drought) resilient farming systems and more sustainable irrigation practices can be extracted from i-rat. details of the participatory approach with research and industry partners that informed the design and function of i-rat and how apsim was set up and parameterised are described. a 'what-if' analysis demonstrated the i-rat features and application.",AB_0078

"background the covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of international migrant workers (imws). imws experience multiple barriers to accessing mental health care. two scalable interventions developed by the world health organization (who) were adapted to address some of these barriers: doing what matters in times of stress (dwm), a guided self-help web application, and problem management plus (pm +), a brief facilitator-led program to enhance coping skills. this study examines whether dwm and pm + remotely delivered as a stepped-care programme (dwm/pm +) is effective and cost-effective in reducing psychological distress, among polish migrant workers with psychological distress living in the netherlands.methods the stepped-care dwm/pm + intervention will be tested in a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (rct) among adult polish migrant workers with self-reported psychological distress (kessler psychological distress scale; k10 > 15.9). participants (n = 212) will be randomized into either the intervention group that receives dwm/pm + with psychological first aid (pfa) and care-as-usual (enhanced care-as-usual or ecau), or into the control group that receives pfa and ecau-only (1:1 allocation ratio). baseline, 1-week post-dwm (week 7), 1-week post-pm + (week 13), and follow-up (week 21) self-reported assessments will be conducted. the primary outcome is psychological distress, assessed with the patient health questionnaire anxiety and depression scale (phq-ads). secondary outcomes are self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), resilience, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. in a process evaluation, stakeholders' views on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of dwm/pm + will be evaluated.discussion to our knowledge, this is one of the first rcts that combines two scalable, psychosocial who interventions into a stepped-care programme for migrant populations. if proven to be effective, this may bridge the mental health treatment gap imws experience.trial registration dutch trial register nl9630, 20/07/2021, https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/27052",AB_0078
"depth estimation is an inverse projection problem that estimates pixel-level distances from a single image. although, supervised methods have shown promising results, it has intrinsic limitations in requiring ground truth depth from an external sensor. on the other hand, self-supervised depth estimation relieves the burden for collecting calibrated training data, while there is still a large performance gap between supervised and self-supervised methods. the objective of this study is to reduce the performance gap between the supervised and self-supervised approaches. the loss function of previous self-supervised methods is mainly based on a photometric error, which is indirectly computed from synthesized images using depth and pose estimates. in this paper, we argue that direct depth cue is more effective to train a depth estimation network. to obtain the direct depth cue, we employed a knowledge distillation technique, which is a teacher-student learning framework. the teacher network was trained in a self-supervised manner based on a photometric error, and its predictions were utilized to train a student network. we constructed a multi-scale dense prediction transformer with monte carlo dropout, and multi-scale distillation loss was proposed to train the student network based on the ensemble of stochastic estimates. experiments were conducted on the kitti and make3d datasets, and our proposed method achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy in self-supervised depth estimation. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ji-min-song/kd-of-ms-dpt.",AB_0078
"background: addressing the association between the perceived physical environment and human fertility is necessary to understand the impact of the built environment on reproductive health and develop effective interventions to improve human fertility. we assessed the association between perceived built environment and pregnancy in infertility patients. methods: we constructed a prospective cohort study (pregnancy and urban environment, prune) recruiting 778 eligible infertility patients who visited one of the two university affiliated infertility centers for infertility treatment between 2019 and 2022. using a mobile survey, we collected the information of demographic, clinical characteristics, residential address, perceived proximity to neighborhood green and blue space, and environmental noise. adjusted risk ratios (arr) were calculated for the achievement of pregnancy within three months of survey participation. results: in the 728 infertility patients, 445 completed the second round of survey. median age of women and men was 39 and 40 years, respectively. most reported they have green (91%) and blue space (67%) within a 10-min walking distance. a fourth of patients (26%) had an annoying environmental noise. probability of pregnancy within three months was higher for those who had green space within walking distance (arr = 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.32). the association with pregnancy was close null for blue space and annoying environmental noise. the arr for women and for men was comparable (p for interaction = 0.875). conclusions: we observed a positive association between living close to green space and pregnancy. this finding would provide evidence of the potential impact of built environment on human fecundity in infertility couples. clinical trial registration: this study is registered in the clinical research information service (https://cris.nih.go.kr, cris number: kct0003560).",AB_0078
"we have undertaken a near-ir weak-lensing (nirwl) analysis of the candels hst/wfc3-ir f160w observations. with the gaia proper motion-corrected catalog as an astrometric reference, we updated the astrometry of the five candels mosaics and achieved an absolute alignment within 002 +/- 002, on average, which is a factor of several superior to existing mosaics. these mosaics are available to download (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k9wev3tbourkblcatj0-wtznuciss__r). we investigated the systematic effects that need to be corrected for weak-lensing measurements. we find that the largest contributing systematic effect is caused by undersampling. we find a subpixel centroid dependence on the psf shape that causes the psf ellipticity and size to vary by up to 0.02% and 3%, respectively. using the uds as an example field, we show that undersampling induces a multiplicative shear bias of -0.025. we find that the brighter-fatter effect causes a 2% increase in the size of the psf and discover a brighter-rounder effect that changes the ellipticity by 0.006. based on the small range of slopes in a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (sed) within the wfc3-ir bandpasses, we suggest that the impact of the galaxy sed on the psf is minor. finally, we model the psf of wfc3-ir f160w for weak lensing using a principal component analysis. the psf models account for temporal and spatial variations of the psf. the psf corrections result in residual ellipticities and sizes, divided by de(1)divided by < 0.0005 +/- 0.0003, divided by de(2)divided by < 0.0005 +/- 0.0003, and divided by dr divided by < 0.0005 +/- 0.0001, that are sufficient for the upcoming nirwl search for massive overdensities in the five candels fields.",AB_0078
"few-shot semantic segmentation (fss) has been developed to perform pixel-level segmentation with only a few dense labeled examples for training, which relieves the expensive annotation problem in traditional segmentation models. current researches on fss generally act the labeled masks on the corresponding support images to obtain the class-specific embeddings, and predict the pixel-level masks for query images by matching their pixels to these class-specific embeddings. their performance is difficult to further break through because of the limited supervision from single-view support images and the neglect of position information from similar pixels between query and support images. to solve these issues, we propose a novel robust prior mask guided model named rpmg-fss for the challenging fss task. the core of rpmg-fss is to produce a robust prior mask with good generalization ability on novel classes to better assist the following query mask prediction. note that each element in the prior mask corresponds to one pixel in query image. it not only considers the interaction within one view and between multiple views of the support image, but also fuses the top- $k$ similarity values to all support pixels and these pixels' position information. the parameters in rpmg-fss are optimized with the combination of segmentation loss and multi-view contrastive loss. comprehensive experiments on two datasets show that our rpmg-fss achieves outstanding performance comparing with the current popular baselines. the code is released on https://github.com/dxzxy12138/rpmg-fss/tree/master",AB_0078
