"this paper aims at medical text classification, where texts describe medicines, diseases, or other medical topics. this field is still challenging since medical texts contain intensive specialization and terminology, which require professional semantic and structured knowledge to classify. based on our observations, medical knowledge graph (kg) can provide such knowledge although they may be ambiguous. to this end, we propose contrastive knowledge integrated graph neural networks (conkgnn) to make full use of the above knowledge. specifically, the proposed method builds two graphs for a medical text, i.e. text graph and text-specific subgraph, containing the text information and relevant kg information, respectively. two graphs are merged into a united graph, which is jointly modeled by graph neural networks (gnn). in this way, our approach adequately learns interactions between neighbors. meanwhile, it promotes the mutual influences between text and kg. we further propose graph-based supervised contrastive learning. by randomly cutting off nodes from the text graph, an augmented united graph is obtained. learning it in a contrastive way could enhance the robustness of introducing kg information. comprehensive experiments are conducted on five chinese medical datasets and experimental results show our model outperforms strong baselines remarkably. consequently, our model can serve as an efficient medical text classifier with excellent performance. we release the code at https://github.com/nolongernome/conkgnn.",AB_0185
"studies have found that different immune subtypes are present in the same tumor. different tumor subtypes have different tumor microenvironments (tme). this means that the efficacy of immunotherapy in actual applications will, therefore, have different results. existing tumor immune subtype studies have mostly focused on immune cells, stromal cells, genes and molecules without considering the presence of microbes. some studies have shown that microflora can strongly promote many gastrointestinal cancers. the microbiome has, therefore, become an important biomarker and regulatory factor of cancer progression and therapeutic responses. in addition, the presence of microflora can strongly regulate the host immune system, indirectly affecting tumor growth. taken together, it is important to study the relationships that develop among tumor tissue microorganisms, tumor immune subtype, and the tme. in this study, correlations between microbial abundance, immune cell infiltra-tion, immune gene expression and tumor immune subtype were studied. to accomplish this, tissue microor-ganisms and immune cell ratios with significant differences between the different cancers were obtained by comparing 203 gastric cancer and intestinal cancer samples. two immune subtypes of intestinal samples were obtained by k-means clustering algorithm and tissue microorganisms, immune cell ratios and immune-related genes with significant differences between different immune subtypes were screened through wilcoxon rank sum test. the results showed that clostridioides difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, yarrowia lipolytica, and fusarium pseudograminearum were all closely associated with the identified tumor immune subtypes. our open-source software is freely available from github at https://github.com/gutmicrobes/imm-subtype.git.",AB_0185
"various methods based on deep neural networks have been proposed to generate color images from gray-scale images, meanwhile, generative adversarial networks (gans) are also gradually applied to image colorization. however, the existing methods are texture-unaware, resulting in dullish color and color bleeding artifacts in the output images. this paper attempt to integrate a novel texture-aware bistream gan into the conventional encoder-decoder structure for image colorization. in this study, the proposed bistream feature extraction module (bsfem) and the feature boosting module (fbm), extract the global and local features from two parallel encoders and fuse them via a novel hybrid attention structure, this novel structure could emphasize the importance of certain channels and locations of features that may potentially benefit image colorization. in addition, the texture colors can be better recovered though the proposed multi-scale feature attention module (msfam). the quantitative experiments demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has improved the psnr and ssim metrics by 18% and 8% respectively. moreover, the qualitative results show that this method is capable of producing visually pleasant color images especially in terms of recovering texture details and eliminating color bleeding along the edges. the source code and data are available online at https://github.com/jarryzang/image-colorization-.",AB_0185
"long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) play important roles by regulating proteins in many biological processes and life activities. to uncover molecular mechanisms of lncrna, it is very necessary to identify interactions of lncrna with proteins. recently, some machine learning methods were proposed to detect lncrna-protein interactions according to the distribution of known interactions. the performances of these methods were largely dependent upon: (1) how exactly the distribution of known interactions was characterized by feature space; (2) how discriminative the feature space was for distinguishing lncrna-protein interactions. because the known interactions may be multiple and complex model, it remains a challenge to construct discriminative feature space for lncrna-protein interactions.to resolve this problem, a novel method named dfrpi was developed based on deep autoencoder and marginal fisher analysis in this paper. firstly, some initial features of lncrna-protein interactions were extracted from the primary sequences and secondary structures of lncrna and protein. secondly, a deep autoencoder was exploited to learn encode parameters of the initial features to describe the known interactions precisely. next, the marginal fisher analysis was employed to optimize the encode parameters of features to characterize a discriminative feature space of the lncrna-protein interactions. finally, a random forest-based predictor was trained on the discriminative feature space to detect lncrna-protein interactions. verified by a series of experiments, the results showed that our predictor achieved the precision of 0.920, recall of 0.916, accuracy of 0.918, mcc of 0.836, specificity of 0.920, sensitivity of 0.916 and auc of 0.906 respectively, which outperforms the concerned methods for predicting lncrna-protein interaction. it may be suggested that the proposed method can generate a reasonable and effective feature space for distinguishing lncrna-protein interactions accurately. the code and data are available on https://github.com/d0ub1e-d/dfrpi.",AB_0185
"magnetic resonance imaging (mri) has become one of the most powerful imaging techniques in medical diagnosis, yet the prolonged scanning time becomes a bottleneck for application. reconstruction meth-ods based on compress sensing (cs) have made progress in reducing this cost by acquiring fewer points in the k-space. traditional cs methods impose restrictions from different sparse domains to regularize the optimization that always requires balancing time with accuracy. neural network techniques enable learning a better prior from sample pairs and generating the results in an analytic way. in this paper, we propose a deep learning based reconstruction method to restore high-quality mri images from undersam-pled k-space data in an end-to-end style. unlike prior literature adopting convolutional neural networks (cnn), advanced swin transformer is used as the backbone of our work, which proved to be powerful in extracting deep features of the image. in addition, we combined the k-space consistency in the output and further improved the quality. we compared our models with several reconstruction methods and variants, and the experiment results proved that our model achieves the best results in samples at low sampling rates. the source code of ktmr could be acquired at https://github.com/bitwzl/ktmr .(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0185
"single-cell transcriptomics provides researchers with a powerful tool to resolve the transcriptome heterogeneity of individual cells. however, this method falls short in revealing cellular heterogeneity at the protein level. previous single-cell multiomics studies have focused on data integration rather than exploiting the full potential of multiomics data. here we introduce a new analysis framework, gene function and protein association (gfpa), that mines reliable associations between gene function and cell surface protein from single-cell multimodal data. applying gfpa to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), we observe an association of epithelial mesenchymal transition (emt) with the cd99 protein in cd4 t cells, which is consistent with previous findings. our results show that gfpa is reliable across multiple cell subtypes and pbmc samples. the gfpa python packages and detailed tutorials are freely available at https://github.com/studentiz/gfpa.",AB_0185
"multi-site learning has attracted increasing interests in autism spectrum disorder (asd) identification tasks by its efficacy on capturing data heterogeneity of neuroimaging taken from different medical sites. however, existing multi-site graph convolutional network (msgcn) often ignores the correlations between different sites, and may obtain suboptimal identification results. moreover, current feature extraction methods characterizing temporal variations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) signals require the time series to be of the same length and cannot be directly applied to multi-site fmri datasets. to address these problems, we propose a dual graph based dynamic multi-site graph convolutional network (dg-dmsgcn) for multi-site asd identification. first, a sliding-window dual-graph convolutional network (sw-dgcn) is introduced for feature extraction, simultaneously capturing temporal and spatial features of fmri data with different series lengths. then we aggregate the features extracted from multiple medical sites through a novel dynamic multi-site graph con-volutional network (dmsgcn), which effectively considers the correlations between different sites and is beneficial to improve identification performance. we evaluate the proposed dg-dmsgcn on public abide i dataset containing data from 17 medical sites. the promising results obtained by our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with increase in identification accuracy, indicating that it has a potential clinical prospect for practical asd diagnosis. our codes are available on https://github.com/junling-du/dg-dmsgcn.",AB_0185
"the aberrant protein sorting has been observed in many conditions, including complex diseases, drug treatments, and environmental stresses. it is important to systematically identify protein mis-localization events in a given condition. experimental methods for finding mis-localized proteins are always costly and time consuming. predicting protein subcellular localizations has been studied for many years. however, only a handful of existing works considered protein subcellular location alterations. we proposed a computational method for identifying alterations of protein subcellular locations under drug treatments. we took three drugs, including tsa (tri-chostain a), bortezomib and tacrolimus, as instances for this study. by introducing dynamic protein-protein interaction networks, graph neural network algorithms were applied to aggregate topological information under different conditions. we systematically reported potential protein mis-localization events under drug treatments. as far as we know, this is the first attempt to find protein mis-localization events computationally in drug treatment conditions. literatures validated that a number of proteins, which are highly related to phar-macological mechanisms of these drugs, may undergo protein localization alterations. we name our method as pla-gnn (protein localization alteration by graph neural networks). it can be extended to other drugs and other conditions. all datasets and codes of this study has been deposited in a github repository (https://github. com/quinlanw/pla-gnn).",AB_0185
"the fundamental properties of molecules bridge experiment and theory. transport properties (diffusion, thermal diffusion, thermal conductivity and viscosity) of binary mixtures are measurable in experiments, and well-defined in theory, but difficult to compute with high accuracy. in addition to high-accuracy inter-molecular potential energy curves (pecs), a reliable and high-order solution program that compute the properties based on the pecs is required. in this work, we present a computer program called peng that performs the collision integration numerically, and solves the boltzmann equation in chapman-enskog fashion. the program has been devised to perform both parts of the solution procedure to arbitrary order, so that no hard-coded limitation will prevent a user from computing at higher precision, except the amount of ram and the required computational time. peng is well-designed in an object-oriented programming (oop) fashion, which make the program clear and easy to modify. in addition to the end-user oriented program, peng is also compiled as a dynamic shared library that may readily be extended and embedded in users' programs. program summary program title: peng cpc library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/n5tm9426jx.1 developer's repository link: https://github.com/zhaiyusci/peng code ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/9951686 licensing provisions: lgpl programming language: c++ nature of problem: nowadays, quantum chemistry provides high-accuracy intermolecular interactions potential energy curves (pecs), and more and more accurate thermophysical properties of dilute gases can be measured experimentally. it is meaningful to build a bridge between thermophysical properties and pecs, so that people can refine the pecs and learn more about the nature of dynamics of gases. for a dilute binary gas mixture, the theory, the boltzmann equation, and its solution has been available for a long time, but fewer numerical solution packages are available for the public. an easy-to-use and easy-to-extend software package is required. solution method: to complete the work, we have created a program that computes the collision integrals (omega((l, s))) for a set of temperatures, following which the thermophysical properties are computed using the chapman-enskog solutions of the boltzmann equation. both parts of the program are written in c++. the program is easy to use, and a well-designed framework is provided thanks to the object-oriented design. users with programming experience can readily extend the present work. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: in this version, the program is limited to the computation of the properties of mixtures of structureless atoms. for polyatomic molecules, additional work need to be done.

"multi-modal skin lesion diagnosis (msld) has achieved remarkable success by modern computer-aided diagno-sis (cad) technology based on deep convolutions. however, the information aggregation across modalities in msld remains challenging due to severity unaligned spatial resolution (e.g., dermoscopic image and clinical image) and heterogeneous data (e.g., dermoscopic image and patients' meta-data). limited by the intrinsic local attention, most recent msld pipelines using pure convolutions struggle to capture representative features in shallow layers, thus the fusion across different modalities is usually done at the end of the pipelines, even at the last layer, leading to an insufficient information aggregation. to tackle the issue, we introduce a pure transformer-based method, which we refer to as throughout fusion transformer (tformer), for sufficient information integration in msld. different from the existing approaches with convolutions, the proposed network leverages transformer as feature extraction backbone, bringing more representative shallow features. we then carefully design a stack of dual-branch hierarchical multi-modal transformer (hmt) blocks to fuse information across different image modalities in a stage-by-stage way. with the aggregated information of image modalities, a multi-modal transformer post-fusion (mtp) block is designed to integrate features across image and non-image data. such a strategy that information of the image modalities is firstly fused then the heterogeneous ones enables us to better divide and conquer the two major challenges while ensuring inter -modality dynamics are effectively modeled. experiments conducted on the public derm7pt dataset validate the superiority of the proposed method. our tformer achieves an average accuracy of 77.99% and diagnostic accuracy of 80.03% , which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. ablation experiments also suggest the effectiveness of our designs. the codes can be publicly available from https://github.com/zylbuaa/tformer.git.",AB_0185
