"background:this study aimed to determine the correlation between human-immunodeficiency-virus (hiv) infection and stroke, as well as to estimate the global, regional, and national burden of hiv-associated stroke.methods:a registered meta-analysis was performed by searching pubmed, embase, and web of science for relevant literature up to october 31, 2022. the pooled relative risk of stroke in hiv-infected people was calculated using a random-effects model. hiv prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (dalys) datasets were obtained from the joint united nations program on hiv and aids, and the global health data exchange, respectively. the population attributable fraction was estimated and delivered to calculate the hiv-associated dalys of stroke from 1990 to 2019, at the global, regional, and national levels. pearson correlation analysis were conducted to assess the correlation between the age-standardized rate or estimated annual percentage changes and the sociodemographic index.results:out of 10 080 identified studies, 11 were included in this meta-analysis. compared with individuals without hiv-infection, the pooled relative risk of stroke in hiv-infected individuals was 1.40 (95% ci, 1.18-1.65). from 1990 to 2019, the global population attributable fraction of hiv-associated stroke increased almost 3-fold, while the hiv-associated dalys increased from 18 595 (95% ci, 7485-31 196) in 1990 to 60 684 (95% ci, 24 281-101 894) in 2019. meanwhile, hiv-associated dalys varied by region, with eastern and southern africa having the highest value of 126 160 in 2019. moreover, countries with middle social development index were shouldering the highest increase trend of the hiv-associated dalys age-standardized rates.conclusions:hiv-infected individuals face a significantly higher risk of stroke, and the global burden of hiv-associated stroke has increased over the past 3 decades, showing regional variations. eastern and southern africa bear the highest burden, while eastern europe and central asia have seen significant growth. health care providers, researchers, and decision-makers should give increased attention to stroke prevention and management in hiv-endemic areas.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: crd42022367450.",AB_0148
"background:experimental studies have demonstrated the neuroprotection of ischemic postconditioning (ipostc) in acute ischemic stroke by attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury. this study aimed to investigate the safety and tolerability of direct ipostc in both a dog model and patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy.methods:the study involved 2 parts. first, ipostc was induced by repeated balloon inflation and deflation in dogs, where a low-pressure balloon was navigated to the anterior spinal artery, and 4 cycles of 5-minute ischemia followed by 5-minute reperfusion were performed. vascular injuries were assessed using angiography and vascular tissue specimens. then, a 3+3 dose-escalation trial was conducted in patients with acute ischemic stroke following successful thrombectomy recanalization. patients received direct ipostc with ischemia and reperfusion durations in progressive increments of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes x4 cycles. major adverse responses were defined as vessel perforation, rupture, dissection, reocclusion, severe vasospasm, thrombotic events, and rupture of the balloon.results:ipostc was investigated in 4 dogs. no vessel perforation or rupture, dissection, or vasospasm was observed under the angiography. only 1 vessel experienced mild injury between the intima and the internal elastic membrane detected on a histopathologic slide. then, 18 patients were recruited. the duration of ipostc was progressively escalated with no major response happened. no patient experienced agitation, discomfort, or other tolerability issues. five patients (27.8%) experienced any intracranial hemorrhage after thrombectomy, and 1 (5.6%) was symptomatic. at 3-month follow-up, no patient died, and 9 patients (50%) achieved functional independence.conclusions:direct ipostc inducing by 4 cycles of 5-minute ischemia followed by 5-minute reperfusion is safe, feasible, and tolerable in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy. further investigations are needed to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of direct ipostc.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct05153655.",AB_0148
"background:it is unclear whether patients with different stroke/transient ischemic attack etiologies benefit differently from gene-directed dual antiplatelet therapy. this study explored the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor-aspirin versus clopidogrel-aspirin in transient ischemic attack or minor stroke with different causes in the chance-2 trial (clopidogrel in high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular events-ii).methods:this was a prespecified analysis of the chance-2 trial, which enrolled 6412 patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack who carried cyp2c19 loss-of-function alleles. patients with centralized evaluation of toast (trial of org 10172 in acute stroke treatment) classification of large-artery atherosclerosis, small-vessel occlusion, and stroke of undetermined cause were included. the primary efficacy outcome was new stroke, and the primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding, both within 90 days. cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the interaction of toast classification with the effects of dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor-aspirin versus clopidogrel-aspirin.results:a total of 6336 patients were included in this study. in patients administered ticagrelor-aspirin and clopidogrel-aspirin, respectively, stroke recurred in 85 (9.8%) and 88 (10.7%) patients with large-artery atherosclerosis (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% ci, 0.63-1.18]; p=0.34); 32 (3.6%) and 61 (7.0%) patients with small-vessel occlusion (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% ci, 0.33-0.79]; p=0.002); and 68 (4.8%) and 87 (5.9%) patients with stroke of undetermined cause (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% ci, 0.58-1.10]; p=0.17), with p=0.08 for the treatmentxcause subtype interaction effect. there were no significant differences in severe or moderate bleeding events in patients with different cause and different treatment.conclusions:in this prespecified analysis of the chance-2 trial, the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor-aspirin versus clopidogrel-aspirin in preventing new stroke were consistent in patients with different causes. the influence of stroke cause on benefit of gene-guided antiplatelet therapy should be explored by further trials.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct04078737.",AB_0148
"study objectives: we explored the effects of stellate ganglion block on postoperative sleep disturbance in patients scheduled to undergo radical surgery for gastrointestinal malignancies.methods: forty such patients were randomly assigned to the control group (group c) or the preoperative stellate ganglion block treatment group (group s). using actigraphy, sleep quality was evaluated on the first night before the operation and first, second, and third postoperative nights. the pittsburgh sleep quality index scale was used for sleep state assessment on 1 day preoperatively and the first, second, third, fifth, and seventh days postoperatively. plasma interleukin (il)-1, il-6, and il-10 and melatonin levels were checked at 1 day preoperatively and the first and third days postoperatively. mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and pulse oxygen saturation (spo2) were recorded before general anesthesia induction, immediately after tracheal intubation, at the beginning of the operation, 1 and 2 hours after the beginning of the operation, at the end of the operation, immediately after extubation, and 30 minutes after transfer to the postanesthesia care unit.results: compared with group c, in group s sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep maintenance were increased and sleep period change index, number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset, and body movements were reduced on the first and second postoperative nights; pittsburgh sleep quality index scores and occurrence of postoperative sleep disturbance were lower on the first and second nights postoperatively; il-6 was reduced on the first night postoperatively; il-1 and il-10 were reduced on the third night postoperatively; melatonin was increased on the first night postoperatively; and mean arterial pressure and heart rate were decreased before general anesthesia induction, immediately after tracheal intubation, and at the end of the operation (all p < .05). conclusions: stellate ganglion block alleviates postoperative sleep disturbance by reducing postoperative inflammatory response, increasing melatonin levels, and stabilizing perioperative hemodynamics in patients undergoing radical surgery for gastrointestinal malignancies.clinical trial registration: registry: clinicaltrials.gov; name: the effect of stellate ganglion block on postoperative sleep disturbance and cognitive function in elderly surgical patients; url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04800653; identifier: nct04800653.",AB_0148
"intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) surveillance based on infrared imaging has wide applications in the anti-uav system for protecting urban security and aerial safety. however, weak target features and complex background distraction pose great challenges for the accurate detection of uavs. to address this issue, we propose a novel differentiated attention guided network to adaptively strengthen the discriminative features between uav targets and complex background. first, a novel spatial-aware channel attention (sca) is introduced into deep layers via preserving critical spatial features and leveraging channel interdependencies to focus on the large-scale targets. the channel-modulated deformable spatial attention is introduced into shallow layers via refining channel context and dynamically perceiving the spatial features for focusing on the small-scale targets. a combination of the above two attention mechanisms is employed in intermediate layers of the network for concentrating on the medium-scale targets. then, we embed a feature aggregator at the detection branches to guide the information exchange of high-level feature maps and low-level feature maps with a bottom-up context modulation, and integrate an sca at the end to further boost the distinctive feature representation for task-awareness. the above design can adaptively enhance multiscale uav target features and suppress complex background interferences, leading to better detection performance, especially for small targets. extensive experiments on real infrared uav datasets reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline object detectors by a large margin, validating its feasibility in real-world infrared uav detection. the source code can be found at https://github.com/kaleidoscopeip/dagnet.",AB_0148
"with the successful application of deep learning to magnetic resonance (mr) imaging, parallel imaging techniques based on neural networks have attracted wide attention. however, in the absence of high-quality, fully sampled datasets for training, the performance of these methods is limited. and the interpretability of models is not strong enough. to tackle this issue, this paper proposes a physics-based unsupervised contrastive representation learning (parcel) method to speed up parallel mr imaging. specifically, parcel has a parallel framework to contrastively learn two branches of model-based unrolling networks from augmented undersampled multi-coil k-space data. a sophisticated co-training loss with three essential components has been designed to guide the two networks in capturing the inherent features and representations for mr images. and the final mr image is reconstructed with the trained contrastive networks. parcel was evaluated on two vivo datasets and compared to five state-of-the-art methods. the results show that parcel is able to learn essential representations for accurate mr reconstruction without relying on fully sampled datasets. the code will be made available at https://github.com/ternencewu123/parcel.",AB_0148
