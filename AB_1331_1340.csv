"in the realm of unraveling covid-19's intricacies, numerous metabolomic investigations have been conducted to discern the unique metabolic traits exhibited within infected patients. these endeavors have yielded a substantial reservoir of potential data pertaining to metabolic biomarkers linked to the virus. despite these strides, a comprehensive and meticulously structured database housing these crucial biomarkers remains absent. in this study, we developed metabolitecovid, a manually curated database of covid-19-related metabolite markers. the database currently comprises 665 manually selected entries of significantly altered metabolites associated with early diagnosis, disease severity, prognosis, and drug response in covid-19, encompassing 337 metabolites. additionally, the database offers a user-friendly interface, containing abundant information for querying, browsing, and analyzing covid-19-related abnormal metabolites in different body fluids. in summary, we believe that this database will effectively facilitate research on the functions and mechanisms of covid-19related metabolic biomarkers, thereby advancing both basic and clinical research on covid-19. metabolitecovid is free available at: https://cellknowledge.com.cn/metabolitecovid.",AB_0134
"magnetic resonance imaging (mri) super-resolution (sr) aims to obtain high resolution (hr) images with more detailed information for precise diagnosis and quantitative image analysis. deep unfolding networks outperform general mri sr reconstruction methods by providing better performance and improved in-terpretability, which enhance the trustworthiness required in clinical practice. additionally, current sr reconstruction techniques often rely on a single contrast or a simple multi-contrast fusion mechanism, ignoring the complex relationships between different contrasts. to address these issues, in this paper, we propose a model-guided multi-contrast interpretable deep unfolding network (mgdun) for medical image sr reconstruction, which explicitly incorporates the well-studied multi-contrast mri observation model into an unfolding iterative network. specifically, we manually design an objective function for mgdun that can be iteratively computed by the half-quadratic splitting algorithm. the iterative mgdun algorithm is unfolded into a special model-guided deep unfolding network that explicitly takes into account both the multi-contrast relationship matrix and the mri observation matrix during the end-to-end optimization process. extensive experimental results on the multi-contrast ixi dataset and the brats 2019 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model, with psnr reaching 37.3366 and 35.9690 respectively. our proposed mgdun provides a promising solution for multi-contrast mr image super-resolution reconstruction. code is available at https://github.com/yggame/mgdun.",AB_0134
"deep learning methods can accurately study noncoding rna protein interactions (npi), which is of great significance in gene regulation, human disease, and other fields. however, the computational method for predicting npi in large-scale dynamic ncrna protein bipartite graphs is rarely discussed, which is an online modeling and prediction problem. in addition, the results published by researchers on the web site cannot meet real-time needs due to the large amount of basic data and long update cycles. therefore, we propose a real-time method based on the dynamic ncrna-protein bipartite graph learning framework, termed ml-gnn, which can model and predict the npis in real time. our proposed method has the following advantages: first, the meta-learning strategy can alleviate the problem of large prediction errors in sparse neighborhood samples; second, dynamic modeling of newly added data can reduce computational pressure and predict npis in real-time. in the experiment, we built a dynamic bipartite graph based on 300000 npis from the npinterv4.0 database. the experimental results indicate that our model achieved excellent performance in multiple experiments. the code for the model is available at https://github.com/taowang11/ml-npi, and the data can be downloaded freely at http://bigdata.ibp.ac.cn/npinter4.",AB_0134
"traffic volume is an indispensable ingredient to provide fine-grained information for traffic management and control. however, due to the limited deployment of traffic sensors, obtaining full-scale volume information is far from easy. existing work on this topic focuses primarily on improving the overall estimation accuracy of a particular method and ignores the underlying challenges of volume estimation, thereby having inferior performance in some critical tasks. this paper studies two key problems with regard to traffic volume estimation: (1) underdetermined traffic flows caused by fully undetected paths that can allow arbitrary volume values without violating the conservation law, where using local side information is insufficient to tackle, and (2) nonequilibrium traffic flows arise when traffic flows vary in density over space and time due to congestion propagation delay, which produce time-shifted volume readings to varying degrees. here we demonstrate a graph-based deep learning method that offers a data-driven, equation-free, and correlation-adaptive approach to address the above issues and perform accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation. particularly, in order to quantify the dynamic and nonlinear speed-volume relationships for the estimation of underdetermined flows, a speed pattern-adaptive adjacency matrix based on graph attention is developed and integrated into the graph convolution process, to capture nonlocal correlations between volumes. to measure the impacts of nonequilibrium flows, a temporal masked and clipped attention combined with a gated temporal convolution layer is customized to capture time-asynchronous correlations between upstream and downstream sensors under varying impacts of congestion delay. we then evaluate our model on a real-world highway traffic volume dataset and compare it with several benchmark models. it is demonstrated that the proposed model achieves high estimation accuracy even under 20% sensor coverage rate and outperforms other baselines significantly, especially on underdetermined and nonequilibrium flow locations. furthermore, comprehensive quantitative model analysis is also carried out to justify the model designs. the source code and datasets are publicly available at: https://github.com/tongnie/gnn4flow.",AB_0134
"topographic reconstruction of the lunar surface or other planets is important to engineering applications and scientific research in a planetary exploration mission. the typical methods of terrain reconstruction are usually based on photogrammetry techniques. structure-from-motion (sfm) is one of the most effective and commonly used photogrammetric technologies that estimate three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences. to find correspondences and align photos, sfm approaches require invariant features, such as scale invariant feature transform (sift). the hand-crafted features, however, seriously degrade performance due to weak texture and low light conditions causing image matching failure, which will directly affect the accuracy and robustness of reconstruction. robust local descriptors based on deep learning outperform hand-crafted descriptors since convolutional neural networks are more robust than hand-engineered representations. therefore, a novel and robust deep learning-based local feature extraction method is proposed, comprising two branch networks integrated with attention mechanisms for generating reliable keypoints and descriptors, respectively. furthermore, a 3d terrain surface reconstruction workflow is constructed by combining it with the modern advanced image matching method and sfm system. the effectiveness of the proposed method and the workflow were verified in experiments using panoramic camera (pcam) images acquired from three waypoints explored by the yutu-2 lunar rover during the chang'e-4 mission. we also illustrate how our approach supports other applications, such as creating panoramic mosaics of surface imagery. this provides a new and powerful method for planetary terrain reconstruction at a high spatial resolution that can meet the requirements for rover navigation and positioning, as well as geological analysis of the moon and other planets. the source codes developed in this study are openly available at https://github.com/atypical-programmer/deep_reconstruction_workflow.",AB_0134
"in recent years, there is been a growing reliance on image analysis methods to bolster dentistry practices, such as image classification, segmentation and object detection. however, the availability of related benchmark datasets remains limited. hence, we spent six years to prepare and test a bench oral implant image dataset (oii-ds) to support the work in this research domain.oii-ds is a benchmark oral image dataset consisting of 3834 oral ct imaging images and 15240 oral implant images. it serves the purpose of object detection and image classification. to demonstrate the validity of the oii-ds, for each function, the most representative algorithms and metrics are selected for testing and evaluation.for object detection, five object detection algorithms are adopted to test and four evaluation criteria are used to assess the detection of each of the five objects. additionally, mean average precision serves as the evaluation metric for multi-objective detection. for image classification, 13 classifiers are used for testing and evaluating each of the five categories by meeting four evaluation criteria. experimental results affirm the high quality of our data in oii-ds, rendering it suitable for evaluating object detection and image classification methods. furthermore, oii-ds is openly available at the url for non-commercial purpose: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22608790.",AB_0134
"spatiotemporal fusion (stf) is crucial for reconciling the conflict between temporal and spatial resolutions of remote sensing observations. however, fusing images in heterogeneous areas remains challenging under continuous missing values. moreover, most current stf methods only consider temporal errors and disregard the spatial scale error in time variation. therefore, we proposed a quick spatiotemporal fusion with coarse-and fine-resolution scale transformation errors and pixel-based synthesis base image pair (stepsbi). first, the optimal pixel-based image synthesis strategy was designed using all available fine-and coarse-resolution images. then, the scale transformation error (ste) of coarse-resolution downscaling to fine-resolution in temporal variation was quantified. and a residual term was introduced to reduce the prediction error from the temporal variation. finally, the spatial scale and temporal errors were corrected using the results of super-pixel seg-mentation as spatial weights. this model has two strengths: (1) pixel-based image synthesis alleviates the absence of base images under continuous missing values; and (2) ste correction restores spatial details of het-erogeneous areas in rapid land cover change. in scenarios of continuous missing images, abrupt land cover changes, and high-resolution heterogeneity, we evaluated stepsbi, the gap filling and savitzky-golay filtering method (gf-sg), the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (starfm), the flexible spatio-temporal data fusion (fsdaf), the cross-attention-based adaptive weighting fusion network (cafe), and the multi-scene spatiotemporal fusion network (mustfn). the results indicate that stepsbi yields better overall performance than other models in cropland, woodland, grassland, and other land cover types. furthermore, ablation experiments demonstrated that each component improved the model's performance. in addition, stepsbi had higher fusion efficiency because it was developed on the google earth engine cloud computing platform. therefore, stepsbi was feasible for advancing fine monitoring of spatiotemporal image fusion under continuous missing values and heterogeneous surfaces. the program of stepbsi is freely available at: https://c ode.earthengine.google.com/684844aa42f64fa6b4eebe3bc0dd6483.",AB_0134
"with similar textures, dark backgrounds, and complex scenes, rgb images are usually unable to provide discriminative information for model training, which often leads to inaccurate prediction results. compared with rgb salient object detection (sod) methods, rgb-t sod have thermal infrared (tir) information as an informational supplement. as a result, rgb-t sod can adapt to more complex environments and achieve better results. however, existing methods do not efficiently integrate features between different modalities and do not fully exploit spatial information from the shallow-level features. accordingly, we propose an edge-net. first, we propose an edge extraction module to capture the edge information in the shallow-level features and use it to guide the subsequent decoding. the original edge features are then weighted after channel attention processing. second, to additionally suppress the noise of the shallow-level features, we design a global information extraction module. in this module, multiple convolutions are used instead of single convolutions to reduce the computational effort, and convolutions with different dilation rates are used to obtain different receptive fields. we conduct extensive experiments on the rgb-t dataset and show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms. the code and results of our method are available in a github repository available at: https://github.com/borreloadd/edge-net.git.",AB_0134
"background: assessment of risk factors is essential for clinical diagnosis and prevention in patients with both diabetes mellitus (dm) and coronary heart disease (chd). in the present study we investigated correlation of the gensini score with the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (macces) in patients with dm and chd. methods: a total of 802 dm patients with chd admitted to the first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university and who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. the median follow-up time for these patients was 3000 days (range 382.5-3000). receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves for the gensini score were generated and the area under the curve (auc) was calculated. patients were divided into two groups based on the gensini score cut-off value. univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors associated with macces. the incidence of macces in the two groups was compared using kaplan-meier analysis. results: the auc of the roc curve was 0.675. the maximum youden's index was 0.248 at a gensini score cut-off value of 74.8605. this gave a sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of macce of 68.8% and 56%, respectively. a high gensini score was a risk factor for macces, and the incidence of macces was significantly greater in the high gensini score group compared to the low gensini score group. conclusions: a high gensini score is a risk factor for patients with dm and chd and is associated with a high incidence of macces. clinical trial registration: the details of study design are registered on http://www.chictr.org.cn (identifier: chictr-2200055450).",AB_0134
"background: to evaluate whether the addition of human menopausal gonadotropin (hmg) during the early follicular phase of controlled ovarian stimulation improves clinical outcomes in patients classified as group 4 on the patient-oriented strategy encompassing individualized oocyte number (poseidon) classification. methods: a prospective, randomized, and non-blind controlled trial was conducted, involving 172 patients seeking infertility treatment with an indication for in vitro fertilization (ivf) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi). among them, 78 patients were randomly assigned to the hmg/follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) group, receiving 75 iu of hmg for fsh on either day 2 or day 3 of menstruation, while 94 patients were assigned to the fsh monotherapy group. results: the total dose of gonadotropin used in the hmg/fsh group (2510.77 +/- 368.11) was higher than that in the fsh alone group (2310.98 +/- 641.33), indicating greater medication usage (p < 0.001). in terms of the mean number of retrieved oocytes and good quality embryos, the hmg supplementation group demonstrated a slight increasing trend (3.79 and 1.43, respectively) compared to the fsh alone group (3.44 and 1.16, respectively), though these differences did not show statistical significance. there is no significant difference in the outcomes of ongoing pregnancy rates, biochemical pregnancy rates, or clinical pregnancy rates per end-cycle or embryo transfer cycle between the two groups. conclusion: the addition of hmg to fsh during the early follicular phase for ivf/icsi did not provide any benefits for patients classified as group 4 on the poseidon classification. clinical trial registration: the study was registered at chinese clinical trial registry (https://www.chictr.org.cn), registration number: chictr2100043040.",AB_0134
