"deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) is an attractive medium for long-term digital data storage due to its extremely high storage density, low maintenance cost and longevity. however, during the process of synthesis, amplification and sequencing of dna sequences with homopolymers of large run -length, three different types of errors, namely, insertion, deletion and substitution errors frequently occur. meanwhile, dna sequences with large imbalances between gc and at content exhibit high dropout rates and are prone to errors. these limitations severely hinder the widespread use of dna -based data storage. in order to reduce and correct these errors in dna storage, this paper proposes a novel coding schema called dna -lc, which converts binary sequences into dna base sequences that satisfy both the gc balance and run -length constraints. furthermore, our coding mode is able to detect and correct multiple errors with a higher error correction capability than the other methods targeting single error correction within a single strand. the decoding algorithm has been implemented in practice. simulation results indicate that our proposed coding scheme can offer outstanding error protection to dna sequences. the source code is freely accessible at https://github.com/xiayangli2301ldna.",AB_0029
"the prediction of peptide and protein function is important for research and industrial applications, and many machine learning methods have been developed for this purpose. the existing models have encountered many challenges, including the lack of effective and comprehensive features and the limited applicability of each model. here, we introduce an integrated peptide and protein function prediction framework based on fused features and ensemble models (ippf-fe), which can accurately capture the relationship between features and labels. the results indicated that ippf-fe outperformed existing state-of-the-art (sota) models on more than 8 different categories of peptide and protein tasks. in addition, t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding demonstrated the advantages of ippf-fe. we anticipate that our method will become a versatile tool for peptide and protein prediction tasks and shed light on the future development of related models. the model is open source and available in the github repository https://github.comituo-synbiolabi ippf-fe.",AB_0029
"motivation: biological experimental approaches to protein-protein interaction (ppi) site prediction are critical for understanding the mechanisms of biochemical processes but are time-consuming and laborious. with the development of deep learning (dl) techniques, the most popular convolutional neural networks (cnn) -based methods have been proposed to address these problems. although significant progress has been made, these methods still have limitations in encoding the characteristics of each amino acid in protein sequences. current methods cannot efficiently explore the nature of position specific scoring matrix (pssm), secondary structure and raw protein sequences by processing them all together. for ppi site prediction, how to effectively model the ppi context with attention to prediction remains an open problem. in addition, the long-distance dependencies of ppi features are important, which is very challenging for many cnn -based methods because the innate ability of cnn is difficult to outperform auto -regressive models like transformers. results: to effectively mine the properties of ppi features, a novel hybrid neural network named hn-ppisp is proposed, which integrates a multi -layer perceptron mixer (mlp-mixer) module for local feature extraction and a two -stage multi -branch module for global feature capture. the model merits transformer, textcnn and bi-lstm as a powerful alternative for ppi site prediction. on the one hand, this is the first application of an advanced transformer (i.e. mlp-mixer) with a hybrid network for sequence -based ppi prediction. on the other hand, unlike existing methods that treat global features altogether, the proposed two -stage multi -branch hybrid module firstly assigns different attention scores to the input features and then encodes the feature through different branch modules. in the first stage, different improved attention modules are hybridized to extract features from the raw protein sequences, secondary structure and pssm, respectively. in the second stage, a multi -branch network is designed to aggregate information from both branches in parallel. the two branches encode the features and extract dependencies through several operations such as textcnn, bi-lstm and different activation functions. experimental results on real -world public datasets show that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over seven remarkable baselines. availability: the source code of hn-ppisp model is available at https://github.com/y1xu05/hn-ppisp.",AB_0029
"the label -free quantification (lfq) has emerged as an exceptional technique in proteomics owing to its broad proteome coverage, great dynamic ranges and enhanced analytical reproducibility. due to the extreme difficulty lying in an in-depth quantification, the lfq chains incorporating a variety of transformation, pretreatment and imputation methods are required and constructed. however, it remains challenging to determine the well -performing chain, owing to its strong dependence on the studied data and the diverse possibility of integrated chains. in this study, an r package evalfq was therefore constructed to enable a performance evaluation on >3000 lfq chains. this package is unique in (a) automatically evaluating the performance using multiple criteria, (b) exploring the quantification accuracy based on spiking proteins and (c) discovering the well -performing chains by comprehensive assessment. all in all, because of its superiority in assessing from multiple perspectives and scanning among over 3000 chains, this package is expected to attract broad interests from the fields of proteomic quantification. the package is available at https://github.convidrblab/evalfq.",AB_0029
"non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are emerging as key regulators of various biological processes. although thousands of ncrnas have been discovered, the transcriptional mechanisms and networks of the majority of ncrnas have not been fully investigated. in this study, we updated chipbase to version 3.0 (https:// rnasysu.com/chipbase3/) to provide the most comprehensive transcriptional regulation atlas of ncrnas and protein-coding genes (pcgs). chipbase has identified similar to 151 187 000 regulatory relationships between similar to 171 600 genes and similar to 3000 regulators by analyzing similar to 55 000 chip-seq datasets, which represent a 30-fold expansion. moreover, we de novo identified similar to 29 000 motif matrices of transcription factors. in addition, we constructed a novel 'enhancer' module to predict similar to 1 837 200 regulation regions functioning as poised, active or super enhancers under similar to 1300 conditions. importantly, we constructed exhaustive co-expression maps between regulators and their target genes by integrating expression profiles of similar to 65 000 normal and similar to 15 000 tumor samples. we built a 'disease' module to obtain an atlas of the disease-associated variations in the regulation regions of genes. we also constructed an 'epiinter' module to explore potential interactions between epitranscriptome and epigenome. finally, we designed 'network' module to provide extensive and gene-centred regulatory networks. chipbase will serve as a useful resource to facilitate integrative explorations and expand our understanding of transcriptional regulation.",AB_0029
"identification of rna-small molecule binding sites plays an essential role in rna -targeted drug discovery and development. these small molecules are expected to be leading compounds to guide the development of new types of rna -targeted therapeutics compared with regular therapeutics targeting proteins. rnas can provide many potential drug targets with diverse structures and functions. however, up to now, only a few methods have been proposed. predicting rna-small molecule binding sites still remains a big challenge. new computational model is required to better extract the features and predict rna-small molecule binding sites more accurately. in this paper, a deep learning model, rlbind, was proposed to predict rna-small molecule binding sites from sequence -dependent and structure -dependent properties by combining global rna sequence channel and local neighbor nucleotides channel. to our best knowledge, this research was the first to develop a convolutional neural network for rna-small molecule binding sites prediction. furthermore, rlbind also can be used as a potential tool when the rna experimental tertiary structure is not available. the experimental results show that rlbind outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in predicting binding sites. therefore, our study demonstrates that the combination of global information for full-length sequences and local information for limited local neighbor nucleotides in rnas can improve the model's predictive performance for binding sites prediction. all datasets and resource codes are available at https://github.comikailiwanglirlbind.",AB_0029
"deciphering the cell-type composition in the tumor immune microenvironment (time) can significantly increase the efficacy of cancer treatment and improve the prognosis of cancer. such a task has benefited from microarrays and rna sequencing technologies, which have been widely adopted in cancer studies, resulting in extensive expression profiles with clinical phenotypes across multiple cancers. current state-of-the-art tools can in fer cell-type composition from bulk expression profiles, providing the possibility of investigating the inter-heterogeneity and intra-heterogeneity of time across cancer types. much can be gained from these tools in conjunction with a well-curated database of time cell-type composition data, accompanied by the corresponding clinical information. however, currently available databases fall short in data volume, multi-platform dataset integration, and tool integration. in this work, we introduce timedb (https://timedb.deepomics.org), an online database for hu-man tumor immune microenvironment cell-type composition estimated from bulk expression profiles. timedb stores manually curated expression profiles, cell-type composition profiles, and the corresponding clinical information of a total of 39,706 samples from 546 datasets across 43 cancer types. timedb comes readily equipped with online tools for automatic analysis and interactive visualization, and aims to serve the community as a convenient tool for investigating the human tumor microenvironment.

"noncoding rnas (ncrnas) play key regulatory roles in biological processes by interacting with other biomolecules. with the development of high-throughput sequencing and experimental technologies, extensive ncrna interactions have been accumulated. therefore, we updated the npinter database to a fifth version to document these interactions. ncrna interaction entries were doubled from 1 100 618 to 2 596 695 by manual literature mining and high-throughput data processing. we integrated global rna-dna interactions from imargi, char-seq and grid-seq, greatly expanding the number of rna-dna interactions (from 888 915 to 8 329 382). in addition, we collected different types of rna interaction between sars-cov-2 virus and its host from recently published studies. long noncoding rna (lncrna) expression specificity in different cell types from tumor single cell rna-seq (scrna-seq) data were also integrated to provide a cell-type level view of interactions. a new module named rbp was built to display the interactions of rna-binding proteins with annotations of localization, binding domains and functions. in conclusion, npinter v5.0 (http://bigdata.ibp.ac.cn/npinter5/) provides informative and valuable ncrna interactions for biological researchers.",AB_0029
"mass spectrometry (ms) is by far the most used experimental approach in high-throughput proteomics. the proteomexchange (px) consortium of proteomics resources (http:// www.proteomexchange. org) was originally set up to standardize data submission and dissemination of public ms proteomics data. it is now 10 years since the initial data workflow was implemented. in this manuscript, we describe the main developments in px since the previous update manuscript in nucleic acids research was published in 2020. the six members of the consortium are pride, peptideatlas (including passel), massive, jpost, iprox and panorama public. we report the current data submission statistics, showcasing that the number of datasets submitted to px resources has continued to increase every year. as of june 2022, more than 34 233 datasets had been submitted to px resources, and from those, 20 062 (58.6%) just in the last three years. we also report the development of the universal spectrum identifiers and the improvements in capturing the experimental metadata annotations. in parallel, we highlight that data re-use activities of public datasets continue to increase, enabling connections between px resources and other popular bioinformatics resources, novel research and also new data resources. finally, we summarise the current state-of-the-art in data management practices for sensitive human (clinical) proteomics data.",AB_0029
