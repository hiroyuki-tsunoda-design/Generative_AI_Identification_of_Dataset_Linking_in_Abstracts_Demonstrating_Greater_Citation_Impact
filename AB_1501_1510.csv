"line segment matching (lsm) plays an important role in image matching, while it is always a challenging problem due to line fracture and high geometric complexity. in this paper, we propose a line segment mismatch removal to address the sensitivity to segment length and the fracture problem. the mismatch removal removes the massive false matches obtained by the descriptors like lbd. specifically, we suggest calculating the endpoint error in lsm rather than the direction error in considering the error band and segment length. we propose a point-pair representation, and transform the lsm problem to be an intuitive point-pair alignment problem with a mixture model. the point-pair representation is more robust on the segment length than the linear equation representation used in ransac, which significantly preserves short line segments. then, based on the point-pair representation, we propose a novel directed endpoint drift method to solve the inherent fracture problem of line segments by allowing the endpoints to move along the line to complement the fracture. compared with the recent learning-based method, the proposed method nearly doubles the number of correct matches on the remote sensing dataset. especially, the recall is improved by 10% to 30% for both the short segments and the slightly fractured segments, compared with the popular ransac and magsac++ methods. the code is available at https://github.com/shenliang16/depd.",AB_0151
"real-time semantic segmentation in traffic scenes plays an essential part in autonomous driving. the encoder-decoder-based network architecture can well combine the context information and detailed information required for the semantic segmentation task. achieving a good balance between inference speed and accuracy is a crucial challenge, as considerable real-time semantic segmentation models process information in real-time at the expense of accuracy degradation. this paper presents an encoder-decoder network model based on cross stage partial (csp) block for real-time semantic segmentation in traffic scenes. integrating the csp block can not only lessen the computational overhead but also enhance the feature extraction ability of the network. in addition, we append the fast spatial pyramid pooling module to the backbone of the network, which can aggregate global information at a low computational cost. on nvidia rtx 3090, the middle model of our method can achieve a mean intersection over union (miou) of 80.8% at 64.3 frames per second (fps) on the cityscapes test set and an miou of 81.3% at 105.3 fps on the camvid test set. the large model of our method can realize an miou of 81.5% at 48.4 fps on the test set of cityscapes. our source code is available at https://github.com/zhouliguo/cspsg.",AB_0151
"twin pregnancy constitutes significant risks for maternal and fetal health, which is usually detected by ultrasound examination at early gestation. however, the imaging-based approach may not accurately identify all twins confounded by practical or clinical variables. the analysis of fetal cell-free dna in noninvasive prenatal screening assays can completement the ultrasound method for twin detection, which differentiates fraternal or identical twins based on their distinctgenotypes. here, a new noninvasive prenatal screening employing high-coverage next-generation sequencing for targeted nucleotide polymorphisms was developed for detection of zygosity and determination of fetal fraction in twin pregnancies. this method utilizes a binary analysis of both the number and allelic fraction of fetus-specific single-nucleotide poly-morphisms to infer the zygosity. in 323 samples collected from 215 singleton, 90 dizygotic, and 18 monozygotic twin pregnancies, all 90 dizygotic twins were correctly detected, with a 100% sensitivity and a 100% specificity. in addition, this method can detect complex pregnancies, such as egg donors, contamination, and twins with complete hydatidiform mole. the fetus-specific fetal fraction change was monitored in nine dizygotic twin pregnancies, which demonstrated highly variable dynamics of fetal cell-free dna turnover up to 7 weeks after twin reduction. overall, this study provides a new noninvasive prenatal screening strategy for the accurate identification of twin zygosity and quantification of fetal fraction, which has important clinical implications for the management of twin pregnancies.

"image retrieval, empowered by deep metric learning, is undoubtedly a building block in today's media-sharing practices, but it also poses a severe risk of digging user privacy via retrieval. state-of-the-art countermeasures are built on adversarial learning, which would spoil the image-sharing mood with significant latency. to relieve the cumbersome experience of such data-centric approaches, we propose a plug-and-play privacy-preserving design (mip) against image retrieval violations by exploring the rule-based triggering characteristics of model backdoors. the basic idea is to inject a privacy-preserving backdoor into the global retrieval model via backdoor learning, thus preventing shared images with such triggers from being searched. at its core, two types of triplet loss functions are invented, namely, imperceptible loss for normal retrieval performance and privacy-sensitive loss for disturbing retrieval with deliberate privacy backdoor injection. extensive experiments on four widely used, realistic datasets showcase that mip provides an outstanding privacy-preserving (backdoor) success rate, e.g., the poisoned retrieval map could be reduced to 0.33% (98.12%1) in cub-200, 0.04% (99.84%1) in in-shop, 0.64% (99.59%1) in cars196 and 0.01% (99.98%1) in sop, respectively, while maintaining similar normal retrieval performance (average 0.02%1); provides a superior efficiency (7 orders of latency reduction) than the baselines. besides, as a model-centric solution, mip yields imperceptible visual changes and is demonstrated to resist potential black-box defenses (e.g., image filtering) and white-box defenses (e.g., fine-pruning). the code and data will be made available at https://github.com/lqsunshine/mip.",AB_0151

"background pulse pressure variation (ppv) is unreliable in predicting fluid responsiveness (fr) in patients receiving mechanical ventilation with spontaneous breathing activity. whether ppv can be valuable for predicting fr in patients with low inspiratory effort is unknown. we aimed to investigate whether ppv can be valuable in patients with low inspiratory effort. methods this prospective study was conducted in an intensive care unit at a university hospital and included acute circulatory failure patients receiving volume- controlled ventilation with spontaneous breathing activity. hemodynamic measurements were collected before and after a fluid challenge. the degree of inspiratory effort was assessed using airway occlusion pressure (p-0.1) and airway pressure swing during a whole breath occlusion (delta p-occ) before fluid challenge. patients were classified as fluid responders if their cardiac output increased by >= 10%. areas under receiver operating characteristic (auroc) curves and gray zone approach were used to assess the predictive performance of ppv. results among the 189 included patients, 53 (28.0%) were defined as responders. a ppv > 9.5% enabled to predict fr with an auroc of 0.79 (0.67-0.83) in the whole population. the predictive performance of ppv differed significantly in groups stratified by the median value of p-0.1 ( p-0.1 < 1.5 cmh(2)o and p-0.1 >= 1.5 cmh(2)o), but not in groups stratified by the median value of delta p-occ (delta p-occ < - 9.8 cmh(2)o and delta p-occ >= - 9.8cmh(2)o). specifically, in patients with p-0.1 < 1.5 cmh(2)o, ppv was associated with an auroc of 0.90 (0.82-0.99) compared with 0.68 (0.57-0.79) otherwise (p = 0.0016). the cut-off values of ppv were 10.5% and 9.5%, respectively. besides, patients with p-0.1 < 1.5 cmh(2)o had a narrow gray zone (10.5-11.5%) compared to patients with p-0.1 >= 1.5 cmh(2)o (8.5-16.5%). conclusions ppv is reliable in predicting fr in patients who received controlled ventilation with low spontaneous effort, defined asp0.1 < 1.5cmh2o. trial registration nct04802668. registered 6 february 2021, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/nct04802668",AB_0151

"the purpose of analytic continuation is to establish a real frequency spectral representation of single-particle or two-particle correlation function (such as green's function, self-energy function, spin and charge susceptibilities) from noisy data generated in finite temperature quantum monte carlo simulations. it requires numerical solutions of a family of fredholm integral equations of the first kind, which is indeed a challenging task. in this paper, an open source toolkit (dubbed acflow) for analytic continuation of quantum monte carlo data is presented. we first give a short introduction to the analytic continuation problem. next, three popular analytic continuation algorithms, including the maximum entropy method, the stochastic analytic continuation, and the stochastic optimization method, as implemented in this toolkit are reviewed. and then we elaborate on the major features, implementation details, basic usage, inputs, and outputs of this toolkit. finally, four representative examples, including analytic continuations of matsubara self-energy function, matsubara and imaginary time green's functions, and current-current correlation function, are shown to demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the acflow toolkit. program summary program title: acflow cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /th6w74gwjm .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /huangli712 /acflow licensing provisions: gnu general public license version 3 programming language: julia nature of problem: most of the quantum monte carlo methods work on imaginary axis. in order to extract physical observables and compare them with the experimental results, analytic continuation must be done in the post-processing stage to convert the quantum monte carlo simulated data from imaginary axis to real axis. solution method: three well-established analytic continuation methods, including the maximum entropy method, the stochastic analytic continuation (both a. w. sandvik's and k. s. d. beach's algorithms), and the stochastic optimization method, have been implemented in the acflow toolkit. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: the acflow toolkit is written in pure julia language. it is highly optimized and parallelized. it can be executed interactively in a jupyter notebook environment.

"accurate airway segmentation from computed tomography (ct) images is critical for planning navigation bronchoscopy and realizing a quantitative assessment of airway-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). existing methods face difficulty in airway segmentation, particularly for the small branches of the airway. these difficulties arise due to the constraints of limited labeling and failure to meet clinical use requirements in copd. we propose a two-stage framework with a novel 3d contextual transformer for segmenting the overall airway and small airway branches using ct images. the method consists of two training stages sharing the same modified 3d u-net network. the novel 3d contextual transformer block is integrated into both the encoder and decoder path of the network to effectively capture contextual and long-range information. in the first training stage, the proposed network segments the overall airway with the overall airway mask. to improve the performance of the segmentation result, we generate the intrapulmonary airway branch label, and train the network to focus on producing small airway branches in the second training stage. extensive experiments were performed on in-house and multiple public datasets. quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our proposed method extracts significantly more branches and longer lengths of the airway tree while accomplishing state-of-the-art airway segmentation performance. the code is available at https://github.com/zhaozsq/ airway_segmentation.",AB_0151
"purpose - the purpose of this study is to reveal the underlying mechanism in film formation of oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. design/methodology/approach - this study focuses on the film forming characteristics of o/w emulsion between the surface of a steel ball and a glass disc coated with chromium. the lubricant film thicknesses of o/w emulsion with various mechanical stirring strength were discussed, which were observed by technique of relative optical interference intensity. findings - the authors directly observed the oil pool in the contact area, finding the size of oil pool was closely related to the film-forming ability of emulsion. enrichment phenomenon occurs in oil pool, which was caused by phase inversion. further investigations revealed that the emulsion is stable with strong stirring strength, resulting in a smaller oil pool size and worse film forming ability. originality/value - with the wide usage of o/w emulsion in both biological and industrial systems, the ability of emulsion film formation is considered as an important factor to evaluate the lubrication effectiveness. peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-12-2022-0354/",AB_0151
