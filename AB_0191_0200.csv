"recent improvements in remote sensing techniques (rst) allow for collecting hyperspectral images (hsis) with enhanced spatial and spectral resolution. these enhancements boost the volume, velocity, and variety of obtaining hsis. however, many hsis comprise extensive variability and undesired pixel distribution because of different atmospheric scattering conditions or maybe because of a malfunction in the rst, called mixed pixels and noise, posing significant processing issues. dimensionality reduction methods (drm) have been developed to address this issue. they reduce the complexity of data while retaining the relevant information for the analysis. this study presents a novel drm called enhancing transformation reduction (etr) that can enhance and reduce the dimensionality of hsi. the data in etr goes through two parts. the first part reduces dimensionality and increases the classes' variation. the second part aims to reduce the noise and the gap between values, and it corrects pixels' location and distribution. etr is an hsi drm that is quick. it was evaluated using four distinct hsis and various state-of-the-art classification models. it enables faster extraction, more robust results, and prompt classification compared to other notable drms. the code of the etr method is available on the github site (https://github.com/dalalal-alimi/etr).",AB_0020
"although elastic properties and their anisotropy play a crucial role in materials science and technology, it is not straightforward to visualize how properties such as shear modulus vary with the direction of stress/strain. here, written in gnu octave, we have developed an easy-to-use, flexible, and userfriendly open-source toolbox with a graphical user interface, velas, which automatically visualizes and analyses the elastic anisotropy of arbitrary crystal systems using second-order elastic constants. using voigt-reuss-hill averaging scheme, velas allows the calculation of more than ten significant mechanical properties such as modulus, hardness, anisotropy index, ductility, and bond type. it also supports the determination of the mechanical stability of crystals at atmospheric and high pressures using the born mechanical stability criterion. velas provides a new easy-to-use tool for detecting and identifying unusual mechanical properties such as negative poisson's ratio, negative linear compressibility, and negative bulk modulus. velas offers several alternative visualization solutions for elastic properties, such as unit spherical projection, and map projection, and supports direct output of high-quality images. furthermore, velas provides users an interface to read data from the materials project api in both online and offline modes. after introducing the basic theory, we detail the software framework, technical route, and installation specifications of velas. moreover, the reliability and versatility of velas are confirmed by the analysis of the cases of negative linear compressibility, negative poisson's ratio, hardness, and fracture toughness.program summary program title: velas cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /bj27474v6f .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /ranzhengcode /velas licensing provisions: gnu general public license 3 programming language: gnu octave nature of problem: to determine the mechanical stability of any crystal at atmospheric and high pressures. to automatically visualize and analyze the elastic anisotropy of arbitrary crystals and identify unusual elastic properties. solution method: firstly, the determination of the mechanical stability of crystals at atmospheric and high pressures using the born mechanical stability criterion. secondly, more than ten significant mechanical properties such as elastic moduli, ratios, hardness, and anisotropy index are analyzed using voigt-reusshill averaging scheme. then, the mechanical behavior of crystals in the elastic regime is derived from a comprehensive tensor analysis of the second-order elastic constants. finally, pugh ratio, hardness, and fracture toughness in 3d space are calculated based on our approximate treatment of elastic properties.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0020
"optical coherence tomography (oct) has been widely adopted for imaging in various areas, yet it is largely affected by speckle noise generated from the coherent multiple-scattered photons. to alleviate the influences of speckle noise, a generative adversarial network with multi-scale convolution and dilated convolution res-network (mdr-gan) is proposed in this study. specifically, a cascade multi-scale module (cmsm) consisting of three convolution and dilated convolution res-network (cd-rn) blocks is proposed to raise network learning capacity, while a new residual learning method is devised to link the input and output feature maps for feature reconstructions. among them, cmsm has the characteristics of capturing multi-scale local features of images. residual learning effectively avoids the degradation problem of the network. extensive experiments with four retinal oct datasets are conducted and results are compared with those of the state-of-the-art deep learning networks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed mdr-gan. results demonstrate that the denoising effect of mdr-gan is better than those of the other denoising methods. the peak single-to-noise ratio (psnr) of mdr-gan is improved by 2 db as compared that of pix2pix, while its equivalent number of looks (enl) is improved by at least 233.9% as compared with the-state-of-the-art existing methods. our mdr-gan code can be download at https://github.com/austin-lms/mdr-gan.",AB_0020
"external knowledge (a.k.a. side information) plays a critical role in zero-shot learning (zsl) which aims to predict with unseen classes that have never appeared in training data. several kinds of external knowledge, such as text and attribute, have been widely investigated, but they alone are limited with incomplete semantics. some very recent studies thus propose to use knowledge graph (kg) due to its high expressivity and compatibility for representing kinds of knowledge. however, the zsl community is still in short of standard benchmarks for studying and comparing different external knowledge settings and different kg-based zsl methods. in this paper, we proposed six resources covering three tasks, i.e., zero-shot image classification (zs-imgc), zero-shot relation extraction (zs-re), and zero-shot kg completion (zs-kgc). each resource has a normal zsl benchmark and a kg containing semantics ranging from text to attribute, from relational knowledge to logical expressions. we have clearly presented these resources including their construction, statistics, data formats and usage cases w.r.t. different zsl methods. more importantly, we have conducted a comprehensive benchmarking study, with a few classic and state-of-the-art methods for each task, including a method with kg augmented explanation. we discussed and compared different zsl paradigms w.r.t. different external knowledge settings, and found that our resources have great potential for developing more advanced zsl methods and more solutions for applying kgs for augmenting machine learning. all the resources are available at https://github.com/china-uk-zsl/resources_for_kzsl.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0020
"in this study, we consider the numerical approximation of incompressible three-component fluids, in which the fluid interfaces are captured by ternary cahn-hilliard equations and the fluid flows are governed by navier-stokes equations. this system includes not only nonlinear effects but also coupling among phase-field variables, velocities, and pressure. the ternary cahn-hilliard-navier-stokes system also satisfies the energy dissipation law, which is a basic physical property. for the appropriate treatment of the nonlinear and coupling terms and preservation of the energy dissipation law in a discrete version, we develop second-order time-accurate, linearly implicit-explicit (imex) methods using a variation of the scalar auxiliary variable (sav) method. to improve the consistency between the original and modified energies, a simple and effective energy relaxation technique is considered. we analytically proved the unique solvability and the relaxed energy dissipation law. the proposed schemes are highly efficient for implementation because only linear elliptic equations need to be solved separately. extensive computational experiments are performed to validate the accuracy, energy stability, and performance of the proposed method. to facilitate further study, we provide the c codes for the typical numerical simulations at http://github .com /yang521.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0020
"privacy protection in the computer vision field has attracted increasing attention. generative adversarial network-based methods have been explored for identity anonymization, but they do not take into consideration semantic information of images, which may result in unrealistic or flawed facial results. in this paper, we propose a semantic-aware de-identification generative adversarial network (sdgan) model for identity anonymization. to retain the facial expression effectively, we extract the facial semantic image using the edge-aware graph representation network to constraint the position, shape and relationship of generated facial key features. then the semantic image is injected into the generator together with the randomly selected identity information for de-identification. to ensure the generation quality and realistic-looking results, we adopt the spade architecture to improve the generation ability of conditional gan. meanwhile, we design a hybrid identity discriminator composed of an image quality analysis module, a vgg-based perceptual loss function, and a contrastive identity loss to enhance both the generation quality and id anonymization. a comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates that our model achieves significantly improved de-identification (de-id) performance and provides more reliable and realistic-looking generated faces. our code and data are available on https://github.com/ kimhyeongbok/sdgan",AB_0020
"purpose - chinese internet literature (cil) platforms afford freedom for creative expression and opportunities for direct interactions between writers and fans and among fans. enabled by these platforms' technological and commercial arrangement, a new form of literary production and consumption has emerged, the most significant of which is the role of fans participation. a social network analysis of the interaction patterns in online fan communities was conducted to investigate fan communication activities at scale. of particular interest is how the socio-technical system of the site influences its network topology. design/methodology/approach - online forums for 10 popular fiction titles in qidian, the leading cil platform, were analyzed. social networks were constructed based on a post-reply-reply threaded discussion structure. various aspects of fan interactions were analyzed, including number of replies per post, post length and emerging network patterns. findings - similarities in network topology shared by cil fan forums and other online communities, such as small-world and scale properties, were discovered; however, distinct network dynamics were also identified. consistent with previous findings, writers and moderators, along with a few highly ranked fans, occupied the central positions in the network. this was due to their social roles and the nature of their posts rather than, as the conventional explanation goes, preferential attachment. originality/value - the findings demonstrate how community-specific circumstances and norms influence interaction patterns and the resultant network structure. it was revealed that in the cil sites, the users adopted the technologies in unexpected ways. and the resulting network topology can be attributed to the interplay between the sites' official arrangement and users' adaptive tactics. peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: .https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/oir11-2021-0596.",AB_0020
"a diverse wuchiapingian brachiopod fauna, which contains 57 species in 28 genera, is described from the shuizhutang formation at the liannan section, guangdong province, southeastern china. four new species tyloplecta liannanensis n. sp., linoproductus huananensis n. sp., araxathyris minor n. sp., and permophricodothyris flata n. sp. are proposed. from well-preserved liannan specimens, characteristics of the shell microstructures in permianella are revised, and different morphologies of muscle scars in permophricodothyris are distinctly shown. until now, only several wuchiapingian brachiopod faunas have been found in south china. compared with these faunas, the liannan fauna shows much higher alpha diversity and is more like faunas from southeastern china than those from the yangtze area in faunal composition. the liannan fauna is dominated with neochonetes, transennatia, orthothetina, permophricodothyris, and cathaysia, which are normally larger and more strongly ornamented than their changhsingian counterparts. the wuchiapingian brachiopods in south china are represented mainly by the douling fauna and shuizhutang fauna. the douling fauna has relatively low diversity and presents the survival stage after the guadalupian-lopingian boundary crisis. the shuizhutang fauna has a much higher diversity and more key changhsingian taxa and shows a rapid radiation stage. faunal compositions of the two faunas indicate that the initial recovery of brachiopods occurred mainly at the genus level followed by a more rapid radiation at both genus and species levels. uuid: http://zoobank.org/474cd988-6ec3-4d16-b045-f84d5fe3fb66",AB_0020
"the current crop rows detection based on machine vision generally has the problems of low detection accuracy and poor real-time performance. moreover, crop rows detection remains a challenging problem in complex field conditions, such as high weeds pressure, poor illumination conditions, and vegetation foliage shading. we propose a crop rows detection algorithm based on autonomous extraction of roi (region of interest). the prior method computes the feature points of the entire image and groups them into the crop rows which they belong to. instead, we consider the core of crop rows detection problem to be the extraction of the travelling area of agricultural machinery in maize fields. a yolo (you only look once) neural network is employed to predict the travelling area of the agricultural machinery end-to-end. the prediction boxes are unified into roi and the crop and soil background are segmented in the roi by excess green operator and otsu's method. then, the feature points of crops are extracted using fast (features from accelerated segment test) corner point detection, and finally the detection lines of crop rows are fitted with least squares method. because image recognition is limited to a valid region after the roi is extracted, the processing speed of our algorithm is remarkably fast. it takes only about 25 ms to process a single image (640*360 pixels) and the frame rate of video stream exceeds 40fps. meanwhile, it can achieve high accuracy and robust extraction of roi in various maize fields. the average error angle of the detection lines is 1.88 degrees, which can meet the real-time and accuracy requirements of field navigation. the proposed algorithm can provide a new solution to the current machine vision-based navigation technology for agricultural machinery. code is available at: https://github.com/woodrattradeco/crop-rows-detection.",AB_0020
"facial expression recognition (fer) has an important role in intelligent human-computer interaction. the complexity and confusion of target emotions and the subjectivity of observers make the definition of emotion categories controversial, and low accuracy has become a bottleneck in facial expression recognition analysis. to establish an emotion representation model with efficient facial expression recognition, this study presents feda, a fine-grained emotion difference analysis based on correlation, and explores the issue of emotion categories with appropriate intraclass correlation and interclass differences. first, a clustering algorithm is employed to obtain variable fine-grained emotion representations. second, the correlation is objectively analysed through recogni-tion and facial action units. last, an emotion representation model that supports high-efficiency fer is obtained. through a test with the ferplus public dataset, the recognition accuracy rate reached 91.5% for the first time, verifying the rationality of our emotion representation model. our experimental results can also support the effective establishment of emotion representation models based on facial expression recognition and have a role in promoting the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, as well as technological development in the fields of human-computer interaction, security, and robotics services. the codes and training logs are publicly available at https://github.com/liuhw01/feda.",AB_0020
