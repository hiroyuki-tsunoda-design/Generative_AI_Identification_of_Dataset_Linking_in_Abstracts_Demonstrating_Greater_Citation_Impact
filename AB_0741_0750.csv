"early detection of sars-cov-2 infection is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset. here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosing and studying sars-cov-2 infection. dubbed pathogen-oriented low-cost assembly & re-sequencing (polar), this method amplifies the entirety of the sars-cov-2 genome. this contrasts with typical rt-pcr-based diagnostic tests, which amplify only a few loci. to achieve this goal, we combine a sars-cov-2 enrichment method developed by the artic network (https://artic.network/) with short-read dna sequencing and de novo genome assembly. using this method, we can reliably (>95% accuracy) detect sars-cov-2 at a concentration of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter (ge/ml). the vast majority of diagnostic methods meeting our analytical criteria that are currently authorized for use by the united states food and drug administration with the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) emergency use authorization require higher concentrations of the virus to achieve this degree of sensitivity and specificity. in addition, we can reliably assemble the sars-cov-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy given sufficient viral load. the genotypic data in these genome assemblies enable the more effective analysis of disease spread than is possible with an ordinary binary diagnostic. these data can also help identify vaccine and drug targets. finally, we show that the diagnoses obtained using polar of positive and negative clinical nasal mid-turbinate swab samples 100% match those obtained in a clinical diagnostic lab using the center for disease control's 2019-novel coronavirus test. using polar, a single person can manually process 192 samples over an 8-hour experiment at the cost of similar to$36 per patient (as of december 7(th), 2022), enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time. we anticipate that further testing and refinement will allow greater sensitivity using this approach.",AB_0075
"backgroundunprofessional behaviours (ub) between healthcare staff are rife in global healthcare systems, negatively impacting staff wellbeing, patient safety and care quality. drivers of ubs include organisational, situational, team, and leadership issues which interact in complex ways. an improved understanding of these factors and their interactions would enable future interventions to better target these drivers of ub.methodsa realist review following rameses guidelines was undertaken with stakeholder input. initial theories were formulated drawing on reports known to the study team and scoping searches. a systematic search of databases including embase, cinahl, medline and hmic was performed to identify literature for theory refinement. data were extracted from these reports, synthesised, and initial theories tested, to produce refined programme theories.resultswe included 81 reports (papers) from 2,977 deduplicated records of grey and academic reports, and 28 via google, stakeholders, and team members, yielding a total of 109 reports. five categories of contributor were formulated: (1) workplace disempowerment; (2) harmful workplace processes and cultures; (3) inhibited social cohesion; (4) reduced ability to speak up; and (5) lack of manager awareness and urgency. these resulted in direct increases to ub, reduced ability of staff to cope, and reduced ability to report, challenge or address ub. twenty-three theories were developed to explain how these contributors work and interact, and how their outcomes differ across diverse staff groups. staff most at risk of ub include women, new staff, staff with disabilities, and staff from minoritised groups. ub negatively impacted patient safety by impairing concentration, communication, ability to learn, confidence, and interpersonal trust.conclusionexisting research has focused primarily on individual characteristics, but these are inconsistent, difficult to address, and can be used to deflect organisational responsibility. we present a comprehensive programme theory furthering understanding of contributors to ub, how they work and why, how they interact, whom they affect, and how patient safety is impacted. more research is needed to understand how and why minoritised staff are disproportionately affected by ub.study registrationthis study was registered on the international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care (prospero): https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?id=crd42021255490.",AB_0075
"worldwide, fire disasters cause social, economic, and environmental damage, so their early detection and instant response is crucial for saving lives and property, which is possible via a soft computing approach. researchers have therefore proposed different artificial intelligence-based approaches to detect fire at its early stages. however, several factors including domain shift problems, limited performance, and model complexity reduced their effectiveness in a real-world environment. to address these challenges, this study proposes an extensive data augmentation approach to tackle the domain shift problem by employing a mono-depth and atmospheric scattering model to generate and synthesise hazy, foggy, and night-time images. to further enhance the detection of small fire-affected areas, a refined densenet backbone is employed. this network is fine-tuned to extract intricate spatial details across different scales and establish meaningful connections between them. subsequently, we introduce a soft attention mechanism into the backbone network. this entails utilising a 3d convolutional operation within the proposed attention framework to capture more extensive spatial features, which contributes to an enhanced discriminatory capability for detecting fire. moreover, we have created a novel dataset explicitly designed for effective fire detection from a remote sensing perspective, known as the aerial drone and satellite fire (adsf) dataset, encompasses images captured by drones and satellites. this broader range of image sources affords coverage across a wider expanse of geographical locations, surpassing the capabilities of cctv cameras. our proposed model achieves significant accuracy improvements, surpassing the state-of-the-art (sota) on both original and augmented datasets. for the yar, fd, dfan, and adsf original datasets, we observed average accuracy increases of 1.25%, 1.95%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. in the comparisons with augmented versions of these datasets, our model consistently outperforms the sota, with accuracy improvements of 0.7, 1.97%, 1.42%, and 1.53%, respectively. additionally, in our ablation studies, the proposed model excels in terms of both performance and resource efficiency. it achieves higher frame rates of 22.0, 72.5, and 7.0 fps on cpu, gpu, and raspberry pi, respectively, with just 7.2 million learning parameters, making it well-suited for real-time deployment on edge devices. finally, a grad-cam xai method is utilised to visualise and highlight the most important regions in images emphasized by the model. the code and dataset are publicly available at https://gith ub.com/hikmat-yar/isprs-fire-detection.",AB_0075
"information on structures of protein-ligand complexes, including comparisons of known and putative protein-ligand-binding pockets, is valuable for protein annotation and drug discovery and development. to facilitate biomedical and pharmaceutical research, we developed possum (https://possum.cbrc.pj.aist.go.jp/possum/), a database for identifying similar binding pockets in proteins. the current possum database includes 191 million similar pairs among almost 10 million identified pockets. possum drug search (possumds) is a resource for investigating ligand and receptor diversity among a set of pockets that can bind to an approved drug compound. the enhanced possumds covers pockets associated with both approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials from the latest release of chembl. additionally, we developed two new databases: possumag for investigating antibody-antigen interactions and possumaf to simplify exploring putative pockets in alphafold human protein models.",AB_0075
"protein-peptide interactions play a crucial role in various cellular processes and are implicated in abnormal cellular behaviors leading to diseases such as cancer. therefore, understanding these interactions is vital for both functional genomics and drug discovery efforts. despite a significant increase in the availability of protein-peptide complexes, experimental methods for studying these interactions remain laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. computational methods offer a complementary approach but often fall short in terms of prediction accuracy. to address these challenges, we introduce pepcnn, a deep learning-based prediction model that incorporates structural and sequence-based information from primary protein sequences. by utilizing a combination of half-sphere exposure, position specific scoring matrices from multiple-sequence alignment tool, and embedding from a pre-trained protein language model, pepcnn outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of specificity, precision, and auc. the pepcnn software and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/abelavit/pepcnn.git.",AB_0075
"sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade by encapsulating steroidal neuromuscular blockers; therefore, it does not pharmacologically affect sedation levels. however, some clinicians avoid using it because of sudden unwanted acting out or patient arousal. previous studies suggested sugammadex-induced awakening, but frontal muscle contraction after sugammadex administration compromised reliability of results obtained from eeg-based anesthesia depth monitoring tools like bispectral index (bis). we hypothesized that sugammadex would affect patients' arousal depending on their baseline levels of sedation. we evaluated arousal signs after sugammadex administration with bis between 25-35 and 45-55 under steady-state propofol-remifentanil anesthesia at the end of a surgery (n=33 in each group). after sugammadex administration, twelve patients with a bis of 45-55 showed clinical signs of awakening but none with a bis of 25-35 (36.4% vs. 0%, p=0.001). the distribution of the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale scores was also significantly different between the two groups (p<0.001). changes in the bis were significantly greater in the bis 45-55 than in the 25-35 group (median difference, 7; 95% ci 2-19, p=0.002). arousal after sugammadex was affected by patient sedation levels, and clinical signs of awakening appeared only in those with bis 45-55. unwanted arousal of the patient should be considered when using sugammadex under shallow anesthesia.clinical trial registry number: clinical trial registry of korea (https://cris.nih.go.kr; principal investigator: jieae kim; registration number: kct0006248; date of first registration: 11/06/2021).",AB_0075
"finding relations between genes and diseases is essential in developing a clinical diagnosis, treatment, and drug design for diseases. one successful approach for mining the literature is the document-based relation extraction method. despite recent advances in document-level extraction of entity-entity, there remains a difficulty in understanding the relations between distant words in a document. to overcome the above limitations, we propose an ai-based text-mining model that learns the document-level relations between genes and diseases using an attention mechanism. furthermore, we show that including a direct edge (de) and indirect edges between genetic targets and diseases when training improves the model's performance. such relation edges can be visualized as graphs, enhancing the interpretability of the model. for the performance, we achieved an f1-score of 0.875, outperforming state-of-the-art document-level extraction models. in summary, the screener identifies biological connections between target genes and diseases with superior performance by leveraging direct and indirect target-disease relations. furthermore, we developed a web service platform named screener (streamlined collaborative learning of ner and re), which extracts the gene-disease relations from the biomedical literature in real-time. we believe this interactive platform will be useful for users to uncover unknown gene-disease relations in the world of fast-paced literature publications, with sufficient interpretation supported by graph visualizations. the interactive website is available at: https://ican.standigm.com.",AB_0075
"backgroundaptamers, which are biomaterials comprised of single-stranded dna/rna that form tertiary structures, have significant potential as next-generation materials, particularly for drug discovery. the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (selex) method is a critical in vitro technique employed to identify aptamers that bind specifically to target proteins. while advanced selex-based methods such as cell- and ht-selex are available, they often encounter issues such as extended time consumption and suboptimal accuracy. several in silico aptamer discovery methods have been proposed to address these challenges. these methods are specifically designed to predict aptamer-protein interaction (api) using benchmark datasets. however, these methods often fail to consider the physicochemical interactions between aptamers and proteins within tertiary structures.resultsin this study, we propose aptatrans, a pipeline for predicting api using deep learning techniques. aptatrans uses transformer-based encoders to handle aptamer and protein sequences at the monomer level. furthermore, pretrained encoders are utilized for the structural representation. after validation with a benchmark dataset, aptatrans has been integrated into a comprehensive toolset. this pipeline synergistically combines with apta-mcts, a generative algorithm for recommending aptamer candidates.conclusionthe results show that aptatrans outperforms existing models for predicting api, and the efficacy of the aptatrans pipeline has been confirmed through various experimental tools. we expect aptatrans will enhance the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of selex in drug discovery. the source code and benchmark dataset for aptatrans are available at https://github.com/pnumlb/aptatrans.",AB_0075
