"the bethe-salpeter equation (bse) approach becomes a methodology commonly used for simulating excitonic and optical properties in computer materials sciences. however, bse approach based directly on first principles demands a high computational cost, being prohibitive for larger systems. in order to overcome this challenge, we have developed wantibexos, a parallel computational fortran code, constituted of a maximally localized wannier functions based tight-binding (mlwf-tb) model in conjunction with bse framework. the mlwf-tb hamiltonian used in wantibexos package can be obtained via any density functional theory package interfaced with wannier90 code. it's expected, due mlwf-tb formalism, a computational time reduction around one or more orders of magnitude in comparison with bse ab initio implementations. in order to demonstrate its reliability, flexibility, efficiency and versatility of wantibexos, we simulate electronic and optical property calculations for the representative materials, including conventional bulk semiconductors, perovskites, nano-monolayer materials and van der waals heterostructures.program summaryprogram title: wantibexoscpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /4vh76mnkv5 .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /ac -dias /wantibexos licensing provisions: gnu general public licence 3.0programming language: fortran90 (intel compiler)external routines: openmp and intel math kernel library (mkl) nature of problem: calculate electronic, optical, and excitonic properties of solids.solution method: tight-binding approach under maximally localized wannier functions (mlwf) parame-trization to describe standard electronic properties and the bethe-salpeter formalism for excitonic properties.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0043
"image deconvolution is a classical inverse problem that serves well as a computational test bench for reconstruction algorithms. namely, the direct operator can be modelled in a straightforward way either by convolution or by multiplication in the frequency domain. further, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem can be adjusted by the form of the point spread function (psf). an open photographic dataset is described, suitable for testing practical deconvolution methods. the image material was designed and collected for the helsinki deblur challenge 2021. the dataset contains pairs of images taken by two identical cameras of the same target but with different conditions. one camera is always in focus and generates sharp and low-noise images, while the other camera produces blurred and noisy photos as it is gradually more and more out of focus and has a higher iso setting. the data is available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4916176",AB_0043
"brain tumors are one of the most fatal cancers. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is a non-invasive method that provides multi-modal images containing important information regarding the tumor. many contemporary techniques employ four modalities: t1-weighted (t1), t1-weighted with contrast (t1c), t2-weighted (t2), and fluid-attenuation-inversion-recovery (flair), each of which provides unique and important characteristics for the location of each tumor. although several modern procedures provide decent segmentation results on the multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats) dataset, they lack performance when evaluated simultaneously on all the regions of mri images. furthermore, there is still room for improvement due to parameter limitations and computational complexity. therefore, in this work, a novel encoder-decoder-based architecture is proposed for the effective segmentation of brain tumor regions. data pre-processing is performed by applying n4 bias field correction, z-score, and 0 to 1 resampling to facilitate model training. to minimize the loss of location information in different modules, a residual spatial pyramid pooling (raspp) module is proposed. raspp is a set of parallel layers using dilated convolution. in addition, an attention gate (ag) module is used to efficiently emphasize and restore the segmented output from extracted feature maps. the proposed modules attempt to acquire rich feature representations by combining knowledge from diverse feature maps and retaining their local information. the performance of the proposed deep network based on raspp, ag, and recursive residual (r2) block termed raagr2-net is evaluated on the brats benchmarks. the experimental results show that the suggested network outperforms existing networks that exhibit the usefulness of the proposed modules for finesegmentation. the code for this work is made available online at: https://github.com/rehman1995/raagr2-net.",AB_0043
"rice blast is one of the most devastating diseases that threatens rice production in taiwan. a rice blast fore-casting model is required to guide the precise application of fungicide. therefore, blastgru-tw model based on deep learning algorithms was developed in this study. the input data comprised approximately 1000 rice blast surveys, collected from 50 fields throughout taiwan between 2014 and 2021, and the corresponding weather data retrieved from weather observation network in taiwan. common and easily accessible meteorological factors, i.e. temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind, were converted into 20 daily meteorological features which were coupled with different time intervals between 1 and 30 days before survey (dbs) to train the model. the results showed that seven meteorological features (daily maximum temperature, daily mean temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily mean humidity, daily mean wv and daily mean wu) and the interval from-4 to-24 dbs were informative in disease prediction, thereby indicating that the proposed model could predict the risk of rice blast by using meteorological data 4-24 days before new disease symptoms appeared. the proposed blastgru-tw model achieved an accuracy of 87.3%. furthermore, on adding the 3 day forecast weather data from weather research and forecasting (wrf) model in the proposed model, the forecast extended to 7 days ahead of the appearance of new symptoms. moreover, the blastam model developed in japan was imple-mented and validated in taiwan to evaluate its applicability in different geographical areas. finally, a rice blast early warning system (https://mycolab.pp.nchu.edu.tw/blast_forecast/index_en.php) equipped with an interac-tive web-based map is now available for real-time forecasting of the risk of rice blast in paddy field across taiwan.",AB_0043
"improving the explainability of computer vision models based on deep learning has recently become a compelling problem, ensuring reliable predictions to the end-user and enabling more fine-grained classifications. recently, concept bottleneck models have been proposed for images classification, partitioning the problem in two stages and thereby defining a hierarchy of concepts. so far, however, little work has been done to investigate the applicability of this approach to other datasets with higher intra-class variability and ambiguity, and to discuss its flexibility to tasks different from whole-images classification. in this work we develop and discuss a concept bottleneck model for images segmentation, objects fine classification and tracking, and compare it to more classical methods based on mask r-cnn and images similarity algorithms. all our models are trained and tested on a dataset comprised of pictures of fridges filled with various objects, however the method can be applied to any fine classification task. the proposed model makes full use of the hierarchy in concepts, exploiting the relationships between different categories at the same hierarchical level and relying on a novel method for handling multi-labels classifications. we show that the performance on fine classification is on par with a regular mask r-cnn, but with a significant increase in explainability and in handling classes confusion. new explainable metrics are proposed to quantitatively evaluate the increase in explainability. we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived concept bottleneck features on related tasks, i.e., the tracking of objects between consecutive pictures in a sequence. the code is released as open source and available at https://opensource.silicon-austria.com/pittinof/hierarchical-concept-bottleneck.",AB_0043
"circular permutation (cp) is a protein sequence rearrangement in which the amino- and carboxyl-termini of a protein can be created in different positions along the imaginary circularized sequence. circularly permutated proteins usually exhibit conserved three-dimensional structures and functions. by comparing the structures of circular permutants (cpms), protein research and bioengineering applications can be approached in ways that are difficult to achieve by traditional mutagenesis. most current cp detection algorithms depend on structural information. because there is a vast number of proteins with unknown structures, many cp pairs may remain unidentified. an efficient sequence-based cp detector will help identify more cp pairs and advance many protein studies. for instance, some hypothetical proteins may have cpms with known functions and structures that are informative for functional annotation, but existing structure-based cp search methods cannot be applied when those hypothetical proteins lack structural information. despite the considerable potential for applications, sequence-based cp search methods have not been well developed. we present a sequence-based method, seqcp, which analyzes normal and duplicated sequence alignments to identify cpms and determine candidate cp sites for proteins. seqcp was trained by data obtained from the circular permutation database and tested with nonredundant datasets from the protein data bank. it shows high reliability in cp identification and achieves an auc of 0.9. seqcp has been implemented into a web server available at: http://pcnas.life.nthu.edu.tw/ seqcp/.

"single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technology allows massively parallel characterization of thou-sands of cells at the transcriptome level. scrna-seq is emerging as an important tool to investigate the cellular components and their interactions in the tumor microenvironment. scrna-seq is also used to reveal the association between tumor microenvironmental patterns and clinical outcomes and to dissect cell-specific effects of drug treatment in complex tissues. recent advances in scrna-seq have driven the discovery of biomarkers in diseases and therapeutic targets. although methods for prediction of drug response using gene expression of scrna-seq data have been proposed, an integrated tool from scrna-seq analysis to drug discovery is required. we present scdrug as a bioinformatics workflow that includes a one-step pipeline to generate cell clustering for scrna-seq data and two methods to predict drug treatments. the scdrug pipeline consists of three main modules: scrna-seq analysis for identifica-tion of tumor cell subpopulations, functional annotation of cellular subclusters, and prediction of drug responses. scdrug enables the exploration of scrna-seq data readily and facilitates the drug repurposing process. scdrug is freely available on github at https://github.com/ailabstw/scdrug.(c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( org/licenses/by/4.0/).",AB_0043
"metazoa gene expression is controlled by modular dna segments called cis-regulatory modules (crms). crms can convey promoter/enhancer/insulator roles, generating additional regulation layers in transcription. experi-ments for understanding crm roles are low-throughput and costly. large-scale crm function investigation still depends on computational methods. however, existing in silico tools only recognize enhancers or promoters exclusively, thus accumulating errors when considering crm promoter/enhancer/insulator roles altogether. currently, no algorithm can concurrently consider these crm roles. in this research, we developed the crm function annotator (cfa) model. cfa provides complete crm transcriptional role labeling based on epigenetic profiling interpretation. we demonstrated that cfa achieves high performance (test macro auroc/auprc = 94.1%/90.3%) and outperforms existing tools in promoter/enhancer/insulator identification. cfa is also inspected to recognize explainable epigenetic codes consistent with previous findings when labeling crm roles. by considering the higher-order combinations of the epigenetic codes, cfa significantly reduces false-positive rates in crm transcriptional role annotation. cfa is available at https://github.com/cobislab/cfa/.",AB_0043
"in epistasis analysis, single -nucleotide polymorphism-single -nucleotide polymorphism interactions (ssis) among genes may, alongside other environmental factors, influence the risk of multifactorial diseases. to identify ssi between cases and controls (i.e. binary traits), the score for model quality is affected by different objective functions (i.e. measurements) because of potential disease model preferences and disease complexities. our previous study proposed a multiobjective approach -based multifactor dimensionality reduction (momdr), with the results indicating that two objective functions could enhance ssi identification with weak marginal effects. however, ssi identification using momdr remains a challenge because the optimal measure combination of objective functions has yet to be investigated. this study extended momdr to the many -objective version (i.e. many -objective mdr, maodr) by integrating various disease probability measures based on a two-way contingency table to improve the identification of ssi between cases and controls. we introduced an objective function selection approach to determine the optimal measure combination in maodr among 10 well-known measures. in total, 6 disease models with and 40 disease models without marginal effects were used to evaluate the general algorithms, namely those based on multifactor dimensionality reduction, momdr and maodr. our results revealed that the maodrbased three objective function model, correct classification rate, likelihood ratio and normalized mutual information (maodr-cln) exhibited the higher 6.47% detection success rates (accuracy) than momdr and higher 17.23% detection success rates than mdr through the application of an objective function selection approach. in a wellcome trust case control consortium, maodr-cln successfully identified the significant ssis (p < 0.001) associated with coronary artery disease. we performed a systematic analysis to identify the optimal measure combination in maodr among 10 objective functions. our combination detected ssis-based binary traits with weak marginal effects and thus reduced spurious variables in the score model. moai is freely available at https://sites.google.comtviewi maodrihome.",AB_0043
"dna methylation occurs in mammals' various diseases, such as cancer and myocardial pain. for a long time, scholars have tried to use machine learning and deep learning to learn the characteristics of dna sequences with high precision for methylation classifications. however, these studies primarily innovated in encoding and seldom employed deep neural networks for predictions. hence, this research proposes a framework with random masking and adversarial sample generation in the previous process. our proposed novel classification model approach composes of convolutional neural network (cnn), bidirectional long short term memory (bi-lstm) and attention mechanism as predictors. the benchmark illustrates the au-tomation and advancement of the proposed framework, which can accurately binarily classify diverse dna methylation. random masking and adversarial sample generation are proven effective by conducting ablation experiments. in detail, our model achieved the best accuracy of 85.07%, 94.97%, and 92.17% in predicting multi-species n4-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, and n6-methyladenine sites, respectively. moreover, by comparing performance with two other methods using the same datasets and indexes, the proposed model (namely maskdna-pgd) successfully surpasses it. finally, our maskdna-pgd can be freely accessed via https://github.com/willyzzz/maskdna-pgd.",AB_0043
