"real-time semantic segmentation, which can be visually understood as the pixel-level classification task on the input image, currently has broad application prospects, especially in the fast-developing fields of autonomous driving and drone navigation. however, the huge burden of calculation together with redundant parameters are still the obstacles to its technological development. in this article, we propose a fast bilateral symmetrical network (fbsnet) to alleviate the above challenges. specifically, fbsnet employs a symmetrical encoder-decoder structure with two branches, semantic information branch and spatial detail branch. the semantic information branch (sib) is the main branch with semantic architecture to acquire the contextual information of the input image and meanwhile acquire sufficient receptive field. while the spatial detail branch (sdb) is a shallow and simple network used to establish local dependencies of each pixel for preserving details, which is essential for restoring the original resolution during the decoding phase. meanwhile, a feature aggregation module (fam) is designed to effectively combine the output of these two branches. experimental results of cityscapes and camvid show that the proposed fbsnet can strike a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. specifically, it obtains 70.9% and 68.9% miou along with the inference speed of 90 fps and 120 fps on these two test datasets, respectively, with only 0.62 million parameters on a single rtx 2080ti gpu. the code is available at https://github.com/iviplab/fbsnet.",AB_0127
"video deraining is an important task in computer vision as the unwanted rain hampers the visibility of videos and deteriorates the robustness of most outdoor vision systems. despite the significant success which has been achieved for video deraining recently, two major challenges remain: 1) how to exploit the vast information among successive frames to extract powerful spatio-temporal features across both the spatial and temporal domains, and 2) how to restore high-quality derained videos with a high-speed approach. in this paper, we present a new end-to-end video deraining framework, dubbed enhanced spatio-temporal interaction network (estinet), which considerably boosts current state-of-the-art video deraining quality and speed. the estinet takes the advantage of deep residual networks and convolutional long short-term memory, which can capture the spatial features and temporal correlations among successive frames at the cost of very little computational resource. extensive experiments on three public datasets show that the proposed estinet can achieve faster speed than the competitors, while maintaining superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods. https://github.com/hdcvlab/enhanced-spatio-temporal-interaction-learning-for-video-deraining.",AB_0127
"we propose a simple yet effective framework for instance and panoptic segmentation, termed condinst (conditional convolutions for instance and panoptic segmentation). in the literature, top-performing instance segmentation methods typically follow the paradigm of mask r-cnn and rely on roi operations (typically roialign) to attend to each instance. in contrast, we propose to attend to the instances with dynamic conditional convolutions. instead of using instance-wise rois as inputs to the instance mask head of fixed weights, we design dynamic instance-aware mask heads, conditioned on the instances to be predicted. condinst enjoys three advantages: 1) instance and panoptic segmentation are unified into a fully convolutional network, eliminating the need for roi cropping and feature alignment. 2) the elimination of the roi cropping also significantly improves the output instance mask resolution. 3) due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated conditional convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv. layers, each having only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster inference time per instance and making the overall inference time less relevant to the number of instances. we demonstrate a simpler method that can achieve improved accuracy and inference speed on both instance and panoptic segmentation tasks. on the coco dataset, we outperform a few state-of-the-art methods. we hope that condinst can be a strong baseline for instance and panoptic segmentation. code is available at: https://git.io/adelaidet.",AB_0127
"identifying enhancers is a critical task in bioinformatics due to their primary role in regulating gene expression. for this reason, various computational algorithms devoted to enhancer identification have been put forward over the years. more features are extracted from the single dna sequences to boost the performance. nevertheless, dna structural information is neglected, which is an essential factor affecting the binding preferences of transcription factors to regulatory elements like enhancers. here, we propose senies, a dna shape enhanced deep learning predictor, to identify enhancers and their strength. the predictor consists of two layers where the first layer is for enhancer and non-enhancer identification, and the second layer is for predicting the strength of enhancers. apart from two common sequence-derived features (i.e., one-hot and k-mer), dna shape is introduced to describe the 3d structures of dna sequences. performance comparison with state-of-the-art methods conducted on public datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our predictor. the code implementation of senies is publicly available at https://github.com/hlju-liye/senies.",AB_0127
"this paper presents a new large multiview dataset called humbi for human body expressions with natural clothing. the goal of humbi is to facilitate modeling view-specific appearance and geometry of five primary body signals including gaze, face, hand, body, and garment from assorted people. 107 synchronized hd cameras are used to capture 772 distinctive subjects across gender, ethnicity, age, and style. with the multiview image streams, we reconstruct the geometry of body expressions using 3d mesh models, which allows representing view-specific appearance. we demonstrate that humbi is highly effective in learning and reconstructing a complete human model and is complementary to the existing datasets of human body expressions with limited views and subjects such as mpii-gaze, multi-pie, human3.6m, and panoptic studio datasets. based on humbi, we formulate a new benchmark challenge of a pose-guided appearance rendering task that aims to substantially extend photorealism in modeling diverse human expressions in 3d, which is the key enabling factor of authentic social tele-presence. humbi is publicly available at http://humbi-data.net.",AB_0127
"with the help of the deep learning paradigm, many point cloud networks have been invented for visual analysis. however, there is great potential for development of these networks since the given information of point cloud data has not been fully exploited. to improve the effectiveness of existing networks in analyzing point cloud data, we propose a plug-and-play module, pnp-3d, aiming to refine the fundamental point cloud feature representations by involving more local context and global bilinear response from explicit 3d space and implicit feature space. to thoroughly evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on three standard point cloud analysis tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, where we select three state-of-the-art networks from each task for evaluation. serving as a plug-and-play module, pnp-3d can significantly boost the performances of established networks. in addition to achieving state-of-the-art results on four widely used point cloud benchmarks, we present comprehensive ablation studies and visualizations to demonstrate our approach's advantages. the code will be available at https://github.com/shiqiu0419/pnp-3d.",AB_0127
"n4-acetylcytidine (ac4c) is a vital constituent of the epitranscriptome and plays a crucial role in the regulation of mrna expression. numerous studies have established correlations between ac4c and the incidence, progression and prognosis of various cancers. therefore, accurately predicting ac4c sites is an important step towards comprehending the biological functions of this modification and devising effective therapeutic interventions. wet experiments are primary methods for studying ac4c, but computational methods have emerged as a promising supplement due to their cost-effectiveness and shorter research cycles. however, current models still have inherent limitations in terms of predictive performance and generalization ability. here, we utilized automated machine learning technology to establish a reliable baseline and constructed a deep hybrid neural network, lsa-ac4c, which combines double-layer long short-term memory (lstm) and self-attention mechanism for accurate ac4c sites prediction. benchmarking comparisons demonstrate that lsa-ac4c exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method, with acc, mcc and auroc improving by 2.89 %, 5.96 % and 1.53 %, respectively, on an independent test set. overall, lsa-ac4c serves as a powerful tool for predicting ac4c sites in human mrna, thus benefiting research on rna modification. for the convenience of the research community, a web server has been established at http://tubic.org/ac4c.",AB_0127
"in this study, we proposed an efficient algorithm (x-ld) for estimating linkage disequilibrium (ld) patterns for a genomic grid, which can be of inter-chromosomal scale or of small segments. compared with conventional methods, the proposed method was significantly faster, dropped from o(nm(2)) to o(n(2)m)-n the sample size and m the number of snps, and consequently we were permitted to explore in depth unknown or reveal long-anticipated ld features of the human genome. having applied the algorithm for 1000 genome project (1kg), we found (1) the extended ld, driven by population structure, universally existed, and the strength of inter-chromosomal ld was about 10% of their respective intra-chromosomal ld in relatively homogeneous cohorts, such as fin, and to nearly 56% in admixed cohort, such as asw. (2) after splitting each chromosome into upmost of more than a half million grids, we elucidated the ld of the hla region was nearly 42 folders higher than chromosome 6 in ceu and 11.58 in asw; on chromosome 11, we observed that the ld of its centromere was nearly 94.05 folders higher than chromosome 11 in yri and 42.73 in asw. (3) we uncovered the long-anticipated inversely proportional linear relationship between the length of a chromosome and the strength of chromosomal ld, and their pearson's correlation was on average over 0.80 for 26 1kg cohorts. however, this linear norm was so far perturbed by chromosome 11 given its more completely sequenced centromere region. uniquely chromosome 8 of asw was found most deviated from the linear norm than any other autosomes. the proposed algorithm has been realized in c++ (called x-ld) and is available at https://github.com/gc5k/gear2, and can be applied to explore ld features in any sequenced populations.",AB_0127
"identifying the atp-binding sites of proteins is fundamentally important to uncover the mechanisms of protein functions and explore drug discovery. many computational methods are proposed to predict atp-binding sites. however, due to the limitation of the quality of feature representation, the prediction performance still has a big room for improvement. in this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model, e2eatp, to dig out more discriminative information from a protein sequence for improving the atp-binding site prediction performance. concretely, we employ a pretrained deep learning-based protein language model (esm2) to automatically extract high-latent discriminative representations of protein sequences relevant for protein functions. based on esm2, we design a residual convolutional neural network to train a protein-atp binding site prediction model. furthermore, a weighted focal loss function is used to reduce the negative impact of imbalanced data on the model training stage. experimental results on the two independent testing data sets demonstrate that e2eatp could achieve higher matthew's correlation coefficient and auc values than most existing state-of-the-art prediction methods. the speed (about 0.05 s per protein) of e2eatp is much faster than the other existing prediction methods. detailed data analyses show that the major advantage of e2eatp lies at the utilization of the pretrained protein language model that extracts more discriminative information from the protein sequence only. the standalone package of e2eatp is freely available for academic at https://github.com/jun-csbio/e2eatp/.",AB_0127
"backgrounddespite the increasing incidence of aplastic anemia in china, few studies have explored its effect on the patients' quality of life from the perspective of these patients. in fact, patients with aplastic disorder live with the disease for a long time, and need to face a variety of difficult realities, including multiple disease symptoms and drug side effects, heavy burden of medical costs, difficulties in social reintegration, and negative emotional distress. therefore, this study used descriptive qualitative research to explore the direct and rich quality-of-life experiences of patients with aplastic anemia.methodsa total of 19 patients with aplastic anemia were recruited in this study using purposive sampling combined with maximum variation strategy. 5 of the patients with aa were from northern china, and the others were from southern china. data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed using the conventional content analysis method.resultsthis study yielded important information about the experiences of patients with aplastic anemia in china. the content analysis method finally identified 3 themes and 9 sub-themes, including: physical symptoms (declining physical capacity, treatment-related symptoms, changes in body image), psychological symptoms (mood changes related to the stage of the disease, change in self-image, growth resulting from the disease experience), social burden (decline in career development, perceived burden to the family, social stigma). patients with aa from different regions didn't show much difference in quality of life.conclusionsaplastic anemia affects the physical, psychological, and social aspects of patients' lives. therefore, health care providers need to consider the patients' physical response and psychological feelings to provide relevant medical guidance and multi-channel social support that would improve their confidence and quality of life.clinical trial registrationname: development and preliminary application of quality of life scale for patients with aplastic anemia. number: chictr2100047575. url: http://www.chictr.org.cn/login.aspx?referurl=%2flistbycreater.aspx.",AB_0127
