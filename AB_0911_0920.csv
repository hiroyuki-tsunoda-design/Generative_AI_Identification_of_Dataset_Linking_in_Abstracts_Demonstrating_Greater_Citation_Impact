"background: total energy expenditure (tee) determines energy requirements, but objective data in patients with cancer are limited. objectives: we aimed to characterize tee, investigate its predictors, and compare tee with cancer-specific predicted energy requirements. methods: this cross-sectional analysis included patients with stages ii-iv colorectal cancer from the protein recommendation to increase muscle (prime) trial. tee was assessed by 24-h stay in a whole-room indirect calorimeter before dietary intervention and compared with cancer-specific predicted energy requirements (25-30 kcal/kg). generalized linear models, paired-samples t tests, and pearson correlation were applied. results: thirty-one patients (56 & plusmn; 10 y; body mass index [bmi]: 27.9 & plusmn; 5.5 kg/m2; 68% male) were included. absolute tee was higher in males (mean difference: 391 kcal/d; 95% ci: 167, 616 kcal/d; p < 0.001), patients with colon cancer (mean difference: 279 kcal/d; 95% ci: 73, 485 kcal/d; p = 0.010), and patients with obesity (mean difference: 393 kcal/d; 95% ci: 182, 604 kcal/d; p < 0.001). appendicular lean soft tissue (fl: 46.72; 95% ci: 34.27, 59.17; p < 0.001) and tumor location (colon-fl: 139.69; 95% ci: 19.44, 259.95; p = 0.023) independently predicted tee when adjusted for sex. error between measured tee and energy requirements predicted by 25 kcal/kg (mean difference: 241 kcal/d; 95% ci: 76, 405 kcal/d; p = 0.010) or 30 kcal/kg (mean difference: 367 kcal/d; 95% ci: 163, 571 kcal/d; p < 0.001) was higher for patients with obesity, and proportional error was observed (25 kcal/kg: r = -0.587; p < 0.001; and 30 kcal/kg: r = -0.751; p < 0.001). tee (mean difference: 25 kcal/kg; 95% ci: 24, 27 kcal/kg) was below predicted requirements using 30 kcal/kg (-430 & plusmn; 322 kcal/d; p < 0.001). conclusions: this is the largest study to assess tee of patients with cancer using whole-room indirect calorimeter and highlights the need for improved assessment of energy requirements in this population. energy requirements predicted using 30 kcal/kg overestimated tee by 1.44 times in a controlled sedentary environment and tee was outside of the predicted requirement range for most. special considerations are warranted when determining tee of patients with colorectal cancer, such as bmi, body composition, and tumor location. this is a baseline cross-sectional analysis from a clinical trial registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct02788955 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nc t02788955).",AB_0092
"gene functional descriptions offer a crucial line of evidence for candidate genes underlying trait variation. conversely, plant responses to environmental cues represent important resources to decipher gene function and subsequently provide molecular targets for plant improvement through gene editing. however, biological roles of large proportions of genes across the plant phylogeny are poorly annotated. here we describe the joint genome institute (jgi) plant gene atlas, an update able data resource consisting of transcript abundance assays spanning 18 diverse species. to integrate across these diverse genotypes, we anal yzed e xpression pr ofiles, b uilt gene c lusters that exhibited tissue / condition specific expression, and tested for transcriptional response to environmental queues. we discovered extensive phylogenetically constrained and condition-specific expression profiles f or genes without an y previously documented functional annotation. such conserved expression patterns and tightly co-expressed gene clusters let us assign expression derived additional biological information to 64 495 genes with otherwise unknown functions. the ever-expanding gene atlas resource is available at jgi plant gene atlas ( https://plantgeneatlas.jgi.doe.gov ) and phytozome ( https://phytozome .jgi.doe .gov/), providing bulk access to data and user-specified queries of gene sets. combined, these web interfaces let users access differentiall y e xpressed genes, track orthologs across the gene atlas plants, graphically represent co-expressed genes, and visualize gene ontology and pathway enrichments.",AB_0092
"background: the global symplicity registry define (denervation findings in real world) investigates radiofrequency renal denervation (rdn) in a broad range of patients with hypertension. we evaluated whether the number or type of antihypertensive medications were associated with increased long-term blood pressure (bp) reductions and cardiovascular outcomes following radiofrequency rdn. methods: patients underwent radiofrequency rdn and were categorized by baseline number (0-3 and >= 4) and different combinations of medication classes. bp changes were compared between groups through 36 months. individual and composite major adverse cardiovascular events were analyzed. results: of 2746 evaluable patients, 18% were prescribed 0 to 3 and 82% prescribed >= 4 classes. at 36 months, office systolic bp significantly decreased (p<0.0001) by -19.0 +/- 28.3 and -16.2 +/- 28.6 mm hg in the 0 to 3 and =4 class groups, respectively. twenty-four-hour mean systolic bp significantly decreased (p<0.0001) by -10.7 +/- 19.7 and -8.9 +/- 20.5 mm hg, respectively. bp reduction was similar between the medication subgroups. antihypertensive medication classes decreased from 4.6 +/- 1.4 to 4.3 +/- 1.5 (p<0.0001). most decreased (31%) or had no changes (47%) to the number of medications, while 22% increased. the number of baseline antihypertensive medication classes was inversely related to the change in prescribed classes at 36 months (p<0.001). cardiovascular event rates were generally low. more patients in the >= 4 compared with 0 to 3 medication classes had myocardial infarction at 36 months (2.8% versus 0.3%; p=0.009). conclusions: radiofrequency rdn reduced bp safely through 36 months, independent of the number and type of baseline antihypertensive medication classes. more patients decreased than increased their number of medications. radiofrequency rdn is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy regardless of antihypertensive medication regimen. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct01534299.",AB_0092
"human tends to locate the facial landmarks with heavy occlusion by their relative position to the easily identified landmarks. the clue is defined as the landmark inherent relation while it is ignored by most existing methods. in this paper, we present dynamic sparse local patch transformer (dslpt), a novel face alignment framework for the inherent relation learning and uncertainty estimation. unlike most existing methods that regress facial landmarks directly from global features, the dslpt first generates a rough representation of each landmark from a local patch cropped from the feature map and then adaptively aggregates them by a case dependent inherent relation. finally, the dslpt predicts the coordinate and uncertainty of each landmark by regressing their probability distribution from the output features. moreover, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework to incorporate with dslpt for an improved result. in the framework, the position and size of each patch are determined by the probability distribution of the corresponding landmark predicted in the previous stage. the dynamic patches will ensure a fine-grained landmark representation for inherent relation learning so that a rough prediction result can gradually converge to the target facial landmarks. we integrate the coarse-to-fine model into an end-to-end training pipeline and carry out experiments on the mainstream benchmarks. the results demonstrate that the dslpt achieves state-of-the-art performance with much less computational complexity. the codes and models are available at https://github.com/jiahao-uts/dslpt.",AB_0092
"background: risk factors, including lymphatic, vascular, and perineural invasion, are considered indications for adjuvant treatment in stage ii colon cancer. however, tumor budding is not included in the above risk factors.objective: this study aimed to assess the value of tumor budding as a prognostic factor in stage ii colon cancer. design: this is a retrospective cohort study.settings: this study was conducted in a tertiary referral center.patients: this study examined 1390 patients with stage ii colon cancer who received curative resection from 2007 to 2013 at an institution.interventions: these patients were classified according to tumor budding status: low-grade tumor budding (less than 10 buds) and high-grade tumor budding (10 buds or more). differences between the 2 groups were corrected by propensity score matching.main outcome measures: disease-free survival and overall survival were the primary end points.results: among 1390 patients, 146 (10.5%) had highgrade tumor budding. the high-grade tumor budding group showed adverse histological characteristics such as advanced t stage, histological grade of differentiation, and presence of lymphatic/perineural invasion. after matching, the 5-year disease-free survival rate for the high-grade tumor budding group was significantly lower than for the low-grade group. we also compared survival outcomes according to tumor budding grade for patients who did not have risk factors and did not receive adjuvant treatment. the 5-year overall survival was similar between the 2 groups. however, the 5-year disease-free survival decreased significantly in the high-grade tumor budding group than in the low-grade tumor budding group. limitations: this was a retrospective study with a single-center design.conclusions: high-grade tumor budding is a poor prognostic factor in stage ii colon cancer and is considered one of the risk factors for adjuvant treatment. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b962.",AB_0092

"rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that leads to progressive articular destruction and severe disability. joint space narrowing (jsn) has been regarded as an important indicator for ra progression and has received significant attention. radiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and monitoring of ra through the assessment of joint space. a new framework for monitoring joint space by quantifying joint space narrowing (jsn) progression through image registration in radiographic images has emerged as a promising research direction. this framework offers the advantage of high accuracy; however, challenges still exist in reducing mismatches and improving reliability. in this work, we utilize a deep intra-subject rigid registration network to automatically quantify jsn progression in the early stages of ra. in our experiments, the mean-square error of the euclidean distance between the moving and fixed images was 0.0031, the standard deviation was 0.0661 mm and the mismatching rate was 0.48%. our method achieves sub -pixel level accuracy, surpassing manual measurements significantly. the proposed method is robust to noise, rotation and scaling of joints. moreover, it provides misalignment visualization, which can assist radiologists and rheumatologists in assessing the reliability of quantification, exhibiting potential for future clinical applications. as a result, we are optimistic that our proposed method will make a significant contribution to the automatic quantification of jsn progression in ra. code is available at https://github.com/pokeblow/deep-registration-qjsn-finger.git.",AB_0092
"here we present a novel machine-learning approach to predict protein aggregation propensity (pap) which is a key factor in the formation of amyloid fibrils based on logistic regression (lr). amyloid fibrils are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases (nd) such as alzheimer's disease (ad) and parkinson's disease (pd), which are caused by oxidative stress and impaired protein homeostasis. accordingly, the paper uses a dataset of hexapeptides with known aggregation tendencies and eight physiochemical features to train and test the lr model. also, it evaluates the performance of the lr model using f-measure and matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) as metrics and compares it with other existing methods. moreover, it investigates the effect of combining sequence and feature information in the prediction. in conclusion, the lr model with sequence and feature information achieves high f-measure (0.841) and mcc (0.6692), outperforming other methods and demonstrating its efficiency and reliability for pap prediction. in addition, the overall performance of the concluded method was higher than the other known servers, for instance, aggrescan, metamyl, foldamyloid, and pasta 2.0. the lr model can be accessed at: https://github.com/katherineeshari/protein-aggregation-prediction.",AB_0092
"growing evidence indicates that early and late postzygotic mosaicism can cause neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds), but detection of low variant allele frequency (vaf) mosaic variants from blood remains a challenge. data of 2162 patients with ndds who underwent conventional genetic tests were reviewed and a deep sequencing was performed using a specifically designed mosaic next-generation sequencing (ngs) panel in the patients with negative genetic test results. forty-four patents with neurocutaneous syn-drome, malformation of cortical development, or nonlesional epileptic encephalopathies were included. in total, mosaic variants were detected from blood in 1.2% (25/2162) of the patients. using conventional ngs panels, 22 mosaic variants (vaf, 8.8% to 29.8%) were identified in 18 different genes. using a specifically designed mosaicism ngs panel, three mosaic variants of the nf1, tsc2, and akt3 genes were identified (vaf, 2.0% to 11.2%). mosaic variants were found frequently in the patients who had neu-rocutaneous syndrome (2/7, 28.6%), whereas only one or no mosaic variant was detected for patients who had malformations of cortical development (1/20, 5%) or nonlesional epileptic encephalopathies (0%, 0/17). in summary, mosaic variants that contribute to the spectrum of ndds can be detected from blood via conventional ngs and specifically designed mosaicism ngs panels, and detection of mosaic variants using blood will increase diagnostic yield.

"knowledge distillation is an approach to transfer information on representations from a teacher to a student by reducing their difference. a challenge of this approach is to reduce the flexibility of the student's representations inducing inaccurate learning of the teacher's knowledge. to resolve the problems, we propose a novel method feature structure distillation that elaborates information on structures of features into three types for transferring, and implements them based on centered kernel analysis. in particular, the global local-inter structure is proposed to transfer the structure beyond the mini-batch. in detail, the method first divides the feature information into three structures: intra-feature, local inter-feature, and global inter-feature structures to subdivide the structure and transfer the diversity of the structure. then, we adopt cka which shows a more accurate similarity metric compared to other metrics between two different models or representations on different spaces. in particular, a memory-augmented transfer method with clustering is implemented for the global structures. the methods are empirically analyzed on the nine tasks for language understanding of the glue dataset with bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (bert), which is a representative neural language model. in the results, the proposed methods effectively transfer the three types of structures and improves performance compared to state-of-the-art distillation methods: (i.e.) ours achieve 66.61% accuracy compared to the baseline (65.55%) in the rte dataset. indeed, the code for the methods is available at https://github.com/maroo-sky/fsd.",AB_0092
