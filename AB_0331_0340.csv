"aging is a complex process that accompanied by molecular and cellular alterations. the identification of tissue-/cell type-specific biomarkers of aging and elucidation of the detailed biological mechanisms of aging-related genes at the single-cell level can help to understand the heterogeneous aging process and design targeted anti-aging therapeutics. here, we built ageanno (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/ageanno/#/), a knowledgebase of single cell annotation of aging in human, aiming to provide comprehensive characterizations for aging-related genes across diverse tissue-cell types in human by using single-cell rna and atac sequencing data (scrna and scatac). the current version of ageanno houses 1 678 610 cells from 28 healthy tissue samples with ages ranging from 0 to 110 years. we collected 5580 aging-related genes from previous resources and performed dynamic functional annotations of the cellular context. for the scrna data, we performed analyses include differential gene expression, gene variation coefficient, cell communication network, transcription factor (tf) regulatory network, and immune cell proportionc. ageanno also provides differential chromatin accessibility analysis, motif/tf enrichment and footprint analysis, and co-accessibility peak analysis for scatac data. ageanno will be a unique resource to systematically characterize aging-related genes across diverse tissue-cell types in human, and it could facilitate antiaging and aging-related disease research.",AB_0034
"the emerging importance of embryonic development research rapidly increases the volume for a professional resource related to multi-omits data. however, the lack of global embryogenesis repository and systematic analysis tools limits the preceding in stem cell research, human congenital diseases and assisted reproduction. here, we developed the ematlas, which collects the most comprehensive multi-omics data and provides multi-scale tools to explore spatiotemporal activation during mammalian embryogenesis. ematlas contains data on multiple types of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, dna methylation, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications, and transcription factors, which displays the complete spatiotemporal landscape in mouse and human across several time points, involving gametogenesis, preimplantation, even fetus and neonate, and each tissue involves various cell types. to characterize signatures involved in the tissue, cell, genome, gene and protein levels during mammalian embryogenesis, analysis tools on these five scales were developed. additionally, we proposed emranger to deliver extensive development-related biological background annotations. users can utilize these tools to analyze, browse, visualize, and download data owing to the user-friendly interface. ematlas is freely accessible at http://bioinfor.imu.edu.cn/ematlas.",AB_0034
"microbiota (http://bio-annotation.cn/microbiota) was constructed to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly resource for the application of microbiome data from diseased tissues, helping users improve theft general knowledge and deep understanding of tissue-derived microbes. various microbes have been found to colonize cancer tissues and play important roles in cancer diagnoses and outcomes, with many studies focusing on developing better cancer-related microbiome data. however, there are currently no independent, comprehensive open resources cataloguing cancer-related microbiome data, which limits the exploration of the relationship between these microbes and cancer progression. given this, we propose a new strategy to re-align the existing next-generation sequencing data to facilitate the mining of hidden sequence data describing the microbiome to maximize available resources. to this end, we collected 417 publicly available datasets from 25 human and 14 mouse tissues from the gene expression omnibus database and use these to develop a novel pipeline to re-align microbiome sequences facilitating in-depth analyses designed to reveal the microbial profile of various cancer tissues and their healthy controls. microbiota is a user-friendly online platform which allows users to browse, search, visualize, and download microbial abundance data from various tissues along with corresponding analysis results, aimimg at providing a reference for cancer-related microbiome research.",AB_0034
"ribozymes are excellent systems in which to study 'sequence- structure - function' relationships in rna molecules. understanding these relationships may greatly help structural modeling and design of functional rna structures and some functional structural modules could be repurposed in molecular design. at present, there is no comprehensive database summarising all the natural ribozyme families. we have therefore created ribocentre, a database that collects together sequence, structure and mechanistic data on 21 ribozyme families. this includes available information on timelines, sequence families, secondary and tertiary structures, catalytic mechanisms, applications of the ribozymes together with key publications. the database is publicly available at https://www.ribocentre.org [graphics] .",AB_0034
"post-translational modifications (ptms) are critical molecular mechanisms that regulate protein functions temporally and spatially in various organisms. since most ptms are dynamically regulated, quantifying ptm events under different states is crucial for understanding biological processes and diseases. with the rapid development of high-throughput proteomics technologies, massive quantitative ptm proteome datasets have been generated. thus, a comprehensive one-stop data resource for surfing big data will benefit the community. here, we updated our previous phosphorylation dynamics database qphos to the qptm (http:// qptm.omicsbio.info). in qptm, 11 482 553 quantification events among six types of ptms, including phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, methylation, sumoylation and ubiquitylation in four different organisms were collected and integrated, and the matched proteome datasets were included if available. the raw mass spectrometry based false discovery rate control and the recurrences of identifications among datasets were integrated into a scoring system to assess the reliability of the ptm sites. browse and search functions were improved to facilitate users in swiftly and accurately acquiring specific information. the results page was revised with more abundant annotations, and time-course dynamics data were visualized in trend lines. we expected the qptm database to be a much more powerful and comprehensive data repository for the ptm research community.",AB_0034
"single-cell studies have delineated cellular diversity and uncovered increasing numbers of previously uncharacterized cell types in complex tissues. thus, synthesizing growing knowledge of cellular characteristics is critical for dissecting cellular heterogeneity, developmental processes and tumorigenesis at single-cell resolution. here, we present cell taxonomy (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/celltaxonomy), a comprehensive and curated repository of cell types and associated cell markers encompassing a wide range of species, tissues and conditions. combined with literature curation and data integration, the current version of cell taxonomy establishes a well-structured taxonomy for 3,143 cell types and houses a comprehensive collection of 26,613 associated cell markers in 257 conditions and 387 tissues across 34 species. based on 4,299 publications and single-cell transcriptomic profiles of similar to 3.5 million cells, cell taxonomy features multifaceted characterization for cell types and cell markers, involving quality assessment of cell markers and cell clusters, cross-species comparison, cell composition of tissues and cellular similarity based on markers. taken together, cell taxonomy represents a fundamentally useful reference to systematically and accurately characterize cell types and thus lays an important foundation for deeply understanding and exploring cellular biology in diverse species.",AB_0034
"functional interpretation of disease-associated non-coding variants remains a significant challenge in the post-gwas era. our recent study has identified 3'utr alternative polyadenylation (apa) quantitative trait loci (3'aqtls) and connects apa events with qtls as a major driver of human traits and diseases. besides 3'utr, apa events can also occur in intron regions, and increasing evidence has connected intronic polyadenylation with disease risk. however, systematic investigation of the roles of intronic polyadenylation in human diseases remained challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive database across a variety of human tissues. here, we developed ipaqtl-atlas (http://bioinfo.szbl.ac.cn/ipaqtl) as the first comprehensive portal for intronic polyadenylation. the ipaqtl-atlas is based on the analysis of 15 170 rna-seq data from 838 individuals across 49 genotype-tissue expression (gtex v8) tissues and contains similar to 0.98 million snps associated with intronic apa events. it provides an interface for ipaqtls search, genome browser, boxplots, and data download, as well as the visualization of gwas and ipaqtl colocalization results. ipaqtl-atlas provides a one-stop portal to access intronic polyadenylation information and could significantly advance the discovery of apa-associated disease susceptibility genes.",AB_0034
"duplicated genes prevail in vertebrates and are important in the acquisition of new genes and novelties. whole genome duplication (wgd) is one of the sources of duplicated genes. it can provide raw materials for natural selection by increasing the flexibility and complexity of the genome. wgds are the driving force for the evolution of vertebrates and contribute greatly to their species diversity, especially in fish species with complicated wgd patterns. here, we constructed the dupscan database (https://dupscan. sysumeg.com/) by integrating 106 chromosomal-level genomes, which can analyze and visualize synteny at both the gene and genome scales, visualize the ka, ks, and 4dtv values, and browse genomes. dupscan was used to perform functional adaptation for the intricate wgd investigation based on synteny matching. dupscan supports the analysis of five wgd rounds (r): vgd2 (vertebrate genome duplication 2), ars3r (acipenser-ruthenus-specific 3r), pss3r (polyodon-spathula-specific 3r), ts3r (teleost-specific duplication 3r), ss4r (salmonid-specific 4r), and cs4r (carp-specific 4r). dupscan serves as one-stop analysis platform for synteny and wgd research in which users can analyze and predict synteny and wgd patterns across 106 species of whole genome sequences. this further aided us in elucidating genome evolutionary patterns across over 60,000 vertebrate species with synteny and wgd events.",AB_0034
"genome-wide association studies (gwass) underlying case-control design have uncovered hundreds of genetic loci involved in tumorigenesis and provided rich resources for identifying risk factors and biomarkers associated with cancer susceptibility. however, the application of gwas in determining the genetic architecture of cancer survival remains unestablished. here, we systematically evaluated genetic effects at the genome-wide level on cancer survival that included overall survival (os) and cancer-specific survival (css), leveraging data deposited in the uk biobank cohort of a total of 19 628 incident patients across 17 cancer types. furthermore, we assessed the causal effects of risk factors and circulating biomarkers on cancer prognosis via a mendelian randomization (mr) analytic framework, which integrated cancer survival gwas dataset, along with phenome-wide association study (phewas) and blood genome-wide gene expression/dna methylation quantitative trait loci (eqtl/meqtl) datasets. on average, more than 10 traits, 700 genes, and 4,500 cpg sites were prone to cancer prognosis. finally, we developed a user-friendly online database, survival related cancer multi-omics database via mendelian randomization (summer; http://njmu-edu.cn:3838/summer/), to help users query, browse, and down-load cancer survival results. in conclusion, summer provides an important resource to assist the research community in understanding the genetic mechanisms of cancer survival.",AB_0034
