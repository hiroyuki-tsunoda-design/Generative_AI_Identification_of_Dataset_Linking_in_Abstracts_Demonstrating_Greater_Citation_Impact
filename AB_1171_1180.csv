"sglt-2 inhibitor, traditionally used for glycemic control, has several beneficial effects that can help manage heart failure (hf). sglt-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with hf. as atrial fibrillation (af) is closely associated with hf and diabetes mellitus (dm) is a risk factor for af, we assume that sglt-2 inhibitors will also show therapeutic benefits regarding af, especially for rhythm control. this trial has a multicenter, prospective, open, blinded endpoint design. it is a 1:1 randomized and controlled study. a total of 716 patients who are newly diagnosed of af and dm within 1 year will be enrolled from 7 tertiary medical centers. the trial is designed to compare the effects of sglt-2 inhibitors and other oral hypoglycemic agents on atrial rhythm control in patients with af and dm. the primary outcome is the recurrence of af within a year (including post-antiarrhythmic drugs (aad) or ablation). the secondary outcomes are the ablation rate within a year, change in af burden, size of the left atrium, nt-probnp, the af symptom score, and the quality of life. this trial will prospectively evaluate the effect and safety of sglt-2 inhibitors on af rhythm control in patients with dm. it will provide an invaluable dataset on rhythm control in af with dm for future studies and offer novel information to assist in clinical decisions.

"multi-modality datasets offer advantages for processing frameworks with complementary information, partic-ularly for large-scale cropland mapping. extensive training datasets are required to train machine learning algorithms, which can be challenging to obtain. to alleviate the limitations, we extract the training samples from the agricultural census information. we focus on japan and demonstrate how agricultural census data in 2015 can map different crop types for the entire country. due to the lack of sentinel-2 datasets in 2015, this study utilized sentinel-1 and landsat-8 collected across japan and combined observations into composites for different prefecture periods (monthly, bimonthly, seasonal). recent deep learning techniques have been investigated the performance of the samples from agricultural census information. finally, we obtain nine crop types on a countrywide scale (around 31 million parcels) and compare our results to those obtained from agricultural census testing samples as well as those obtained from recent land cover products in japan. the generated map accurately represents the distribution of crop types across japan and achieves an overall accuracy of 87% for nine classes in 47 prefectures. our findings highlight the importance of using multi -modality data with agricultural census information to evaluate agricultural productivity in japan. the final products are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7519274.",AB_0118
"goryeocrinus pentagrammos n. gen. n. sp. from the jigunsan formation of south korea is described and is the first diplobathrid recorded from middle ordovician (middle darriwilian) strata of east gondwana. phylogenetic analyses suggest that g. pentagrammos n. gen. n. sp. is a member of the paraphyletic rhodocrinitidae of the diplobathrida and most closely related to paradiabolocrinus from the late ordovician (sandbian) of laurentia. goryeocrinus pentagrammos n. gen. n. sp. is characterized by having a pentameral, flat bowl-shaped calyx, a conspicuous pentagrammatic ridge formed by bifurcated median ray ridge and pentagonal basal ridge, at least two interradials in the first row of regular interrays, an anitaxial ridge originating from the cd interray but close to the c ray radial, and lacking intrabrachials and interradials between secundibrachials. the occurrence of g. pentagrammos n. gen. n. sp. from south korea (east gondwana) drastically expands the ordovician paleogeographic range of camerates, which otherwise have been recorded from laurentia, west gondwana, avalonia, and baltica.uuid: http://zoobank.org/a5f8fc12-25a5-4e7c-92e8-bf3ea07c3ba3",AB_0118
"motivation: finding molecules with desired pharmaceutical properties is crucial in drug discovery. generative models can be an efficient tool to find desired molecules through the distribution learned by the model to approximate given training data. existing generative models (i) do not consider backbone structures (scaffolds), resulting in inefficiency or (ii) need prior patterns for scaffolds, causing bias. scaffolds are reasonable to use, and it is imperative to design a generative model without any prior scaffold patterns. results: we propose a generative model-based molecule generator, sc2mol, without any prior scaffold patterns. sc2mol uses smiles strings for molecules. it consists of two steps: scaffold generation and scaffold decoration, which are carried out by a variational autoencoder and a transformer, respectively. the two steps are powerful for implementing random molecule generation and scaffold optimization. our empirical evaluation using drug-like molecule datasets confirmed the success of our model in distribution learning and molecule optimization. also, our model could automatically learn the rules to transform coarse scaffolds into sophisticated drug candidates. these rules were consistent with those for current lead optimization. availability and implementation: the code is available at https://github.com/zhiruiliao/sc2mol. contact: zhusf@fudan.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0118
"recently, peptide-based drugs have gained unprecedented interest in discovering and developing antifungal drugs due to their high efficacy, broad-spectrum activity, low toxicity and few side effects. however, it is time-consuming and expensive to identify antifungal peptides (afps) experimentally. therefore, computational methods for accurately predicting afps are highly required. in this work, we develop afp-mfl, a novel deep learning model that predicts afps only relying on peptide sequences without using any structural information. afp-mfl first constructs comprehensive feature profiles of afps, including contextual semantic information derived from a pre-trained protein language model, evolutionary information, and physicochemical properties. subsequently, the co-attention mechanism is utilized to integrate contextual semantic information with evolutionary information and physicochemical properties separately. extensive experiments show that afp-mfl outperforms state-of-the-art models on four independent test datasets. furthermore, the shap method is employed to explore each feature contribution to the afps prediction. finally, a user-friendly web server of the proposed afp-mfl is developed and freely accessible at http://inner.wei-group.net/afpmfl/, which can be considered as a powerful tool for the rapid screening and identification of novel afps.",AB_0118
"tomato yellow leaf curl virus (tylcv) dispersed across different countries, specifically to subtropical regions, associated with more severe symptoms. since tylcv was first isolated in 1931, it has been a menace to tomato industrial production worldwide over the past century. three groups were newly isolated from tylcv-resistant tomatoes in 2022; however, their functions are unknown. the development of machine learning (ml)-based models using characterized sequences and evaluating blind predictions is one of the major challenges in interdisciplinary research. the purpose of this study was to develop an integrated computational framework for the accurate identification of symptoms (mild or severe) based on tylcv sequences (isolated in korea). for the development of the framework, we first extracted 11 different feature encodings and hybrid features from the training data and then explored 8 different classifiers and developed their respective prediction models by using randomized 10-fold cross-validation. subsequently, we carried out a systematic evaluation of these 96 developed models and selected the top 90 models, whose predicted class labels were combined and considered as reduced features. on the basis of these features, a multilayer perceptron was applied and developed the final prediction model (iml-tylcvs). we conducted blind prediction on 3 groups using iml-tylcvs, and the results indicated that 2 groups were severe and 1 group was mild. furthermore, we confirmed the prediction with virus-challenging experiments of tomato plant phenotypes using infectious clones from 3 groups. plant virologists and plant breeding professionals can access the user-friendly online iml-tylcvs web server at https://balalab-skku.org/ iml-tylcvs, which can guide them in developing new protection strategies for newly emerging viruses.",AB_0118
"some patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (poaf) after non-cardiac surgery need treatment, and a predictive model for these patients is clinically useful. here, we developed a predictive model for poaf in non-cardiac surgery based on machine learning techniques. in a total of 201,864 patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery between january 2011 and june 2019 at our institution, 5,725 (2.8%) were treated for poaf. we used machine learning with an extreme gradient boosting algorithm to evaluate the effects of variables on poaf. using the top five variables from this algorithm, we generated a predictive model for poaf and conducted an external validation. the top five variables selected for the poaf model were age, lung operation, operation duration, history of coronary artery disease, and hypertension. the optimal threshold of probability in this model was estimated to be 0.1, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auroc) curve was 0.80 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.78-0.81. accuracy of the model using the estimated threshold was 0.95, with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.28 and 0.97, respectively. in an external validation, the auroc was 0.80 (0.78-0.81). the working predictive model for poaf requiring treatment in non-cardiac surgery based on machine learning techniques is provided online (https://sjshin.shinyapps.io/afib_predictor_0913/). the model needs further verification among other populations.",AB_0118
"motivation: adverse drug reactions (adrs) are a major issue in drug development and clinical pharmacology. as most adrs are caused by unintended activity at off-targets of drugs, the identification of drug targets responsible for adrs becomes a key process for resolving adrs. recently, with the increase in the number of adr-related data sources, several computational methodologies have been proposed to analyze adr-protein relations. however, the identification of adr-related proteins on a large scale with high reliability remains an important challenge. results: in this article, we suggest a computational approach, large-scale adr-related proteins identification with network embedding (lapine). lapine combines a novel concept called single-target compound with a network embedding technique to enable large-scale prediction of adr-related proteins for any proteins in the protein-protein interaction network. analysis of benchmark datasets confirms the need to expand the scope of potential adr-related proteins to be analyzed, as well as lapine's capability for high recovery of known adr-related proteins. moreover, lapine provides more reliable predictions for adr-related proteins (value-added positive predictive value=0.12), compared to a previously proposed method (p < 0.001). furthermore, two case studies show that most predictive proteins related to adrs in lapine are supported by literature evidence. overall, lapine can provide reliable insights into the relationship between adrs and proteomes to understand the mechanism of adrs leading to their prevention. availability and implementation: the source code is available at github (https://github.com/rupinas/lapine) and figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/software/lapine/21750245) to facilitate its use. contact: dhlee@kaist.ac.kr supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0118
"the cell surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria are involved in many important biological functions, including the infection of host cells. owing to their virulent nature, these proteins are also considered strong candidates for potential drug or vaccine targets. among the various cell surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria, lpxtg-like proteins form a major class. these proteins have a highly conserved c-terminal cell wall sorting signal, which consists of an lpxtg sequence motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a positively charged tail. these surface proteins are targeted to the cell envelope by a sortase enzyme via transpeptidation. a variety of lpxtg-like proteins have been experimentally characterized; however, their number in public databases has increased owing to extensive bacterial genome sequencing without proper annotation. in the absence of experimental characterization, identifying and annotating these sequences is extremely challenging. therefore, in this study, we developed the first machine learning-based predictor called gpapred, which can identify lpxtg-like proteins from their pri-mary sequences. using a newly constructed benchmark dataset, we explored different classifiers and five feature encodings and their hybrids. optimal features were derived using the recursive feature elimination method, and these features were then trained using a support vector machine algorithm. the performance of different models was evaluated using independent datasets, and a final model (gpapred) was selected based on consistency during cross-validation and independent assessment. gpapred can be an effective tool for predicting lpxtg-like sequences and can be further employed for functional characterization or drug targeting. availability: https://p rocarb.org/gpapred/.",AB_0118
"motivation: subcellular localization of human proteins is essential to comprehend their functions and roles in physiological processes, which in turn helps in diagnostic and prognostic studies of pathological conditions and impacts clinical decision-making. since proteins reside at multiple locations at the same time and few subcellular locations host far more proteins than other locations, the computational task for their subcellular localization is to train a multilabel classifier while handling data imbalance. in imbalanced data, minority classes are underrepresented, thus leading to a heavy bias towards the majority classes and the degradation of predictive capability for the minority classes. furthermore, data imbalance in multilabel settings is an even more complex problem due to the coexistence of majority and minority classes. results: our studies reveal that based on the extent of concurrence of majority and minority classes, oversampling of minority samples through appropriate data augmentation techniques holds promising scope for boosting the classification performance for the minority classes. we measured the magnitude of data imbalance per class and the concurrence of majority and minority classes in the dataset. based on the obtained values, we identified minority and medium classes, and a new oversampling method is proposed that includes non-linear mixup, geometric and colour transformations for data augmentation and a sampling approach to prepare minibatches. performance evaluation on the human protein atlas kaggle challenge dataset shows that the proposed method is capable of achieving better predictions for minority classes than existing methods. availability and implementation: data used in this study are available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/human-protein-atlas-image-classification/data. source code is available at https://github.com/priyarana/protein-subcellular-localisation-method. contact: yang.song1@unsw.edu.au supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0118
