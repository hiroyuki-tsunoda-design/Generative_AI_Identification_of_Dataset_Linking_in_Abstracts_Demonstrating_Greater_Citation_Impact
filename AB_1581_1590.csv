"background depression is a condition that imposes a significant disease burden, with cognitive impairment being one of its costly symptoms. while cognitive rehabilitation is crucial, it is also challenging. although some studies have investigated the impact of exergames on cognitive function improvement, these have primarily focused on the elderly population, with limited attention given to individuals with depression. consequently, this study aims to investigate the effects of exergames on cognitive functions in adolescents with depression and compare the effectiveness of exergames with traditional exercise. method the present investigation is a single-center randomized controlled trial that employs the anova method to calculate the sample size using g*power software, assuming a 25% dropout rate. the study enrolls fifty-four eligible patients with depression who are randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: the exergames group, which receives standard treatment and exergames intervention; the exercise group, which receives standard treatment and traditional exercise intervention; and the control group, which receives standard treatment exclusively. the study provides a comprehensive regimen of 22 supervised exercise and exergame sessions over an 8-week period, with a frequency of twice per week for the initial two weeks and three times per week for the subsequent six weeks. the researchers gather cognitive, mood, and sleep metrics at the onset of the first week, as well as at the conclusion of the fourth and eighth weeks. the researchers employ a wearable device to track participants' heart rate during each intervention session and evaluate the borg rating of perceived exertion scale at the conclusion of each session. discussion the findings from this study make several contributions to the current literature. first, this study comprehensively reports the efficacy of an exergames intervention for multidimensional symptoms in adolescents with depression. second, this study also compares the efficacy of exergames with that of traditional exercise. these findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of exergames as an adjunctive intervention for depression and lay the groundwork for future research. trial registration this trial is registered with the chinese clinical trials registry (registration number: chictr2100052709; registration status: prospective registration;) 3/11/2021, url: http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit.aspx?pid=135663&htm=4.",AB_0159
"background falls are a global public problem and may be an important cause of death in older adults. however, older adults with mild cognitive impairment(mci) are more likely to fall and suffer more damage than older adults with normal cognitive function, which shows the importance of preventing falls. more and more evidence shows that baduanjin can improve the balance function of the elderly and reduce the risk of falls in the elderly with mci, but the mechanism is still unclear. the main purpose of this study is to verify the intervention effect of baduanjin training on the risk of falls in elderly people with mci and to elucidate the underlying mechanism of baduanjin training in reducing the risk of falls in mci patients. methods in this prospective study, outcome assessor-blind, three-arm randomized controlled trial, a total of 72 eligible participants will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) into the 12-week baduanjin exercise intervention (60 min per session, three sessions per week), the 12-week brisk walking group(60 min per session, three sessions per week) or the 12-week health education group. primary outcome is the fall-risk self-assessment questionnaire(frq), and secondary outcomes are fall efficacy index, gait assessment, balance function, lower limb muscle strength, cognitive function, activities of daily living(adl) and mri scans. in addition to the mri scans, which will be measured before and after the intervention,other primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks (at the end of the intervention) and after an additional 12-week follow-up period. the mixed linear model will be conducted to observe the intervention effects. discussion this trial will investigate the effect of baduanjin exercise on the prevention of falls in elderly individuals with mci, explore the imaging mechanism of baduanjin exercise to reduce the risk of falls in elderly individuals with mci from the perspective of vestibular neural network, and provide strong evidence for baduanjin exercise to reduce the risk of falls in elderly individuals with mci, as well as provide new ideas and approaches for the central mechanism of traditional chinese medicine( trc) rehabilitation methods to intervene in falls in elderly. trial registration chictr.org.cn, id: chictr2200057520. registered on 14 march 2022, https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=146592.",AB_0159
"one driving application for multi-robots is source seeking, especially in the hazardous environment. it consists of two essential subtasks: source location and path search. nature inspired meta-heuristic is preferable in addressing the source location subtask which is an inversion problem, while the astar algorithm and its variants are widely used for the path search subtask. in this paper, we present a multi-robot team simulator as a container which contains both algorithms as components. the simulator takes the constraints into consideration, including the size and the speed bound of each robot, the obstacle and collision avoidance. we provide a python implementation and example problems for research and test purposes. the well-structured code with object-oriented design can be conveniently upgraded by adding new excellent nature inspired metaheuristics, or extended to other source seeking problems in various field applications. the python code can be downloaded from the website: https://github.com/buctlab/source-seeking-multi-robot-team-simulator.",AB_0159
"controllable summarization allows users to generate customized summaries with specified attributes. however, due to the lack of designated annotations of controlled summaries, existing work has to craft pseudo datasets by adapting generic summarization benchmarks. furthermore, most research focuses on controlling single attributes individually (e.g., a short summary or a highly abstractive summary) rather than controlling a mix of attributes together (e.g., a short and highly abstractive summary). in this paper, we propose mac sum, the first human-annotated summarization dataset for controlling mixed attributes. it contains source texts from two domains, news articles and dialogues, with human-annotated summaries controlled by five designed attributes (length, extractiveness, specificity, topic, and speaker). we propose two simple and effective parameter-efficient approaches for the new task of mixed controllable summarization based on hard prompt tuning and soft prefix tuning. results and analysis demonstrate that hard prompt models yield the best performance on most metrics and human evaluations. however, mixed-attribute control is still challenging for summarization tasks. our dataset and code are available at https:// github.com/psunlpgroup/macsum.",AB_0159
"rna n6-methyladenine (m6a), which is produced by the methylation of the n6 position of eukaryotic adenine, is a relatively common post-transcriptional modification on the surface of the molecule, which frequently plays a crucial role in biological processes. biological experimental methods to identify m6a have been studied and implemented in recent years, but they cannot be promoted widely due to drawbacks such as the time and cost of reagents and equipment. therefore, researchers have proposed computational strategies for identifying m6a sites, but these strategies do not account for the mechanism of methylation occurrence or the structure of rna molecules. this study, therefore, proposed a novel deep learning model for predicting m6a sites, gr-m6a, which predicts m6a sites by extracting features from the physicochemical properties and spatial structure of molecules via residual networks. in gr-m6a, each rna base string is represented by smiles as two matrices comprising topology structural information and node attributes with molecular physicochemical characteristics. the feature encoding matrix was then obtained by fusing the topology matrix and the node matrix in accordance with the graphical convolutional network principle. correspondingly, the more discriminative features were extracted from the encoding matrix using the residual neural network and predicted using a multilayer perceptron. as evident from the 5-fold cross-validation and independent validation, the gr-m6a model outperformed other existing methods. thus, we hope that gr-m6a can aid researchers in predicting mammalian m6a loci. the source code and database are available at https://github.com/yingliangjxau/gr-m6a.",AB_0159
"targeting lncrnas by small molecules (sm-lncr) to alter their expression levels has emerged as an important therapeutic modality for disease treatment. to date, no computational tools have been dedicated to predicting small molecule-mediated upregulation or downregulation of lncrna expression. here, we introduce deepdlncud, which integrates predictions of nine deep learning algorithms together, to infer the regulation types of small molecules on modulating lncrna expression. through systematic optimization on a training set of 771 upregulation and 739 downregulation sm-lncr pairs, each encoding 1369 sequence, representational, and physiochemical features, this method outperforms a recently released program, deepsmirud, by achieving 0.674 in auc (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), 0.722 in aucpr (area under the precision-recall curve), 0.681 in f1-score, and 0.516 in jaccard index on a test set of 222 sm-lncr pairs. by extracting 125 upregulation and 46 downregulation sm-lncr pairs that involve disease-associated lncrnas, deepdlncud is shown to gain an accuracy of 0.700 in the pathological context. using connectivity scores, around half of the small molecules are correctly estimated as drugs to treat lncrna-regulated diseases. this tool can be run at a fast speed to assist the discovery of potential small molecule drugs of lncrna targets on a large scale. deepdlncud is publicly available at https://github.com/2003100127/deepdlncud.",AB_0159
"as a special group, visually impaired people (vip) find it difficult to access and use visual information in the same way as sighted individuals. in recent years, benefiting from the development of computer hardware and deep learning techniques, significant progress have been made in assisting vip with visual perception. however, most existing datasets are annotated in single scenario and lack of sufficient annotations for diversity obstacles to meet the realistic needs of vip. to address this issue, we propose a new dataset called walk on the road (wotr), which has nearly 190 k objects, with approximately 13.6 objects per image. specially, wotr contains 15 categories of common obstacles and 5 categories of road judging objects, including multiple scenario of walking on sidewalks, tactile pavings, crossings, and other locations. additionally, we offer a series of baselines by training several advanced object detectors on wotr. furthermore, we propose a simple but effective pcyolo to obtain excellent detection results on wotr and pascal voc datasets. the wotr dataset is available at https://github.com/kxzr/wotr",AB_0159
"glacier surging is an unusual instability of ice flow, and inventories of surging glaciers are important for regional glacier mass balance studies and glacier dynamic studies. glacier surges in high mountain asia (hma) have been widely reported. however, the completeness of available inventories of hma surging glaciers is hampered by the insufficient spatial and temporal coverage of glacier change observations or by the limitations of the identification methods. in this study, we established a new inventory of hma surging glaciers based on glacier surface elevation changes and morphological changes over 4 decades. three elevation change datasets based on four elevation sources (the kh-9 dem, nasa dem, cop30 dem, and hma dem) and long-term landsat satellite image series were utilized to assess the presence of typical surge features over two time periods (1970s-2000 and 2000-2020). a total of 890 surging and 336 probably or possibly surging glaciers were identified in hma. compared to the most recent inventory of surging glaciers in hma, our inventory incorporated 253 previously unidentified surging glaciers. the number and area of surging glaciers accounted for similar to 2:49% (excluding glaciers smaller than 0.4 km(2)) and similar to 16:59% of the total glacier number and glacier area in hma, respectively. glacier surges were found in 21 of the 22 subregions of hma (except for the dzhungarsky alatau); however, the density of surging glaciers is highly uneven. glacier surges occur frequently in the northwestern subregions (e.g., pamir and karakoram) but less often in the peripheral subregions. the inventory further shows that surge activity is more likely to occur for glaciers with a larger area, longer length, and wider elevation range. among glaciers with similar areas, the surging ones usually have steeper slopes than non-surging ones. the inventory and elevation change products of identified surging glaciers are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7961207 (guo et al., 2023).",AB_0159
"transfusion-dependent non-severe aplastic anemia (td-nsaa) is a rare condition of bone marrow failure that can persist for a long time or develop into severe aplastic anemia ( saa). little is known about the clinical and laboratory characteristics, and disease prognosis and outcomes in td-nsaa patients. the clinical and laboratory data of 124 consecutive td-nsaa patients in the chinese eastern collaboration group of anemia from december 2013 and january 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. in 124 td-nsaa patients, the median age was 32 years (range: 3-80) and the median disease course was 38 months (range: 3-363). common complications were iron overload (53/101, 52.5%), liver and kidney dysfunction (42/124, 33.9%), diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance (24/ 124, 19.4%), and severe infection (29 cases, 23.4%). 58% of patients (57/124) developed severe aplastic anemia with a median progression time of 24 months (range: 3-216). patients with absolute neutrophil count (anc) <0.5x10(9)/l, severe infection, or iron overload had a higher probability of progression to saa (p=0.022, p=0.025, p= 0.001). patients receiving antithymocyte globulin ( atg) plus cyclosporin a (csa) had a higher overall response rate compared to those receiving csa alone (56.7% vs 19.3%, p < 0.001). the addition of atg was the favorable factor for efficacy (p=0.003). fourteen patients developed secondary clonal hematologic disease: eleven patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, two patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and one patient with acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. ten patients (8.1%) died with a median follow-up of 12months (range: 3- 36months). patients with td-nsaa usually have a prolonged course of disease, and are prone to be complicated with important organ damage and disease progression to saa. intensive immunosuppressive therapy based on atg might be an appropriate approach for td-nsaa. clinical trial registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit.aspx?pid=125480&htm=4, identifier chictr2100045895.",AB_0159
"semantic segmentation is a dense pixel prediction task, and its accuracy depends on the extraction of long-range contextual knowledge and refinement of segmentation boundaries. most segmentation methods are based on feature extraction using a convolutional neural network, and layer-by-layer sampling and fusion are applied to solve inherent problems such as chaotic boundaries and scattered objects. owing to the limited receptive field and loss of details during downsampling, the segmentation results may be unsatisfactory. to address existing shortcomings, we propose a dual-stage refinement network (drnet) for semantic segmentation. in the first stage, we adopt an efficient spatiotemporal representation learning framework called uniformer. we also use a novel boundary extractor and initial segmentation map generator to obtain rough segmentation results. in the second stage, we use the rough segmentation map and extracted boundary information in a graph reasoning module that restores the class boundary features while completing global modeling and local information inference. benefiting from the acquisition of long-range dependencies between image pixels, contextual information promotes the distinction of pixel categories. in addition, edge information can increase the interclass distinguishability and refine the segmentation boundaries. results from extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed drnet outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods. the codes and results are available at: https://github.com/enquanyang2022/drnet.",AB_0159
