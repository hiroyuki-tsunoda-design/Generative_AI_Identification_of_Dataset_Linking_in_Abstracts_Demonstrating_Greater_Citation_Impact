"methods based on convolutional neural networks have achieved excellent performance in the image dehazing task. unfortunately, most of the dehazing methods that exist suffer from loss of detail in the convolution and activation operations and failure to consider the effects of superimposing different intensities of haze, such as under-exposed and over-exposed images. to address these issues, we propose a dynamic dehazing convolution (ddc) based on attentional weight calculation and dynamic weight fusion and a dynamic dehazing activation (dda) based on the input global context encoding function to address the problem of detail loss. and we propose a multi-scaled feature-fused image dehazing network (mfid-net) based on ddc and dda to address the effects of haze superposition. we also design a loss function based on the physical model with dynamic weights. extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mfid-net performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms on the hazy dataset while improving further on hazy images with large differences in haze concentration, and producing satisfactory dehazing results. the code is available at https://github.com/awhitewhale/mfid-net.",AB_0157

"semi-supervised semantic segmentation aims to classify the pixels with both labeled and unlabeled images. how to utilize unlabeled images is a key part of semi-supervised learning. the existing methods tend to exploit the reliable pixels which can be classified to a specific category with high reliability, ignoring the unreliable pixels which cannot be identified into a special category with low reliability, resulting in information loss. moreover, uneven number of pixels per category often leads to misclassification of small-scale category pixels. in this paper, we propose a multi-reliability and multi-level feature augmentation framework. multi-reliability feature augmentation dedicates to extract unreliable/reliable pixel features to take full advantage of pixel information. multi-level feature augmentation dedicates to extract category/image level semantic features to avoid the sparse semantic information provided by category with a small number of pixels, which can lead to misclassification. furthermore, a variety of data perturbations are employed to enhance the robustness of our model. experimental results on the pascal voc 2012, cityscapes datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. our code is available at https://github.com/jianjianyin/mmfa.",AB_0157
"rare diseases (rds) may affect individuals in small numbers, but they have a significant impact on a global scale. accurate diagnosis of rds is challenging, and there is a severe lack of drugs available for treatment. pharma-ceutical companies have shown a preference for drug repurposing from existing drugs developed for other dis-eases due to the high investment, high risk, and long cycle involved in rd drug development. compared to traditional approaches, knowledge graph embedding (kge) based methods are more efficient and convenient, as they treat drug repurposing as a link prediction task. kge models allow for the enrichment of existing knowledge by incorporating multimodal information from various sources. in this study, we constructed rdkg-115, a rare disease knowledge graph involving 115 rds, composed of 35,643 entities, 25 relations, and 5,539,839 refined triplets, based on 372,384 high-quality literature and 4 biomedical datasets: drkg, pathway commons, pharmkg, and pmapp. subsequently, we developed a trimodal kge model containing structure, category, and description embeddings using reverse-hyperplane projection. we utilized this model to infer 4199 reliable new inferred triplets from rdkg-115. finally, we calculated potential drugs and small molecules for each of the 115 rds, taking multiple sclerosis as a case study. this study provides a paradigm for large-scale screening of drug repurposing and discovery for rds, which will speed up the drug development process and ultimately benefit patients with rds. the source code and data are available at https://github.com/zhuchaoy/rdkg-115.",AB_0157

"accurate crop classification map is of great significance in various fields such as the survey of agricultural resource, the analysis of existing circumstance on land application, the yield estimation of crop and the disaster warning. the methods based on machine learning and deep learning are popularly used in crop classification and recognition of remote sensing images. however, the crop classification task based on neural networks still faces significant challenges due to the spatial and temporal distribution of crops and the inherent characteristics of remote sensing images. therefore, this study proposes the multi-layer pyramid crop classification network (mpnet) to solve the above problems. to reduce the feature loss during the crop extraction, the proposed model uses the pyramid pooling module to improve the ability of global information acquisition, and the information concatenation module to retain the upper features. using the gf-6 and sentinel-2 satellite data, the proposed model was tested in erhai lake basin and beian city. compared with other five deep learning models, such as fcn, segnet, u-net, pspnet and deeplabv3+, the experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves the highest accuracy in both study areas. meanwhile, the proposed model has the advantages of short training time and high efficiency under the same running conditions. overall, this study is beneficial to improve the efficiency and accuracy of crop classification task in the unbalanced temporal and spatial distribution. it also brings a feasible scheme for crop classification tasks in complex growing areas. the code has been publicly available at https://github.com/xu-chang-hong/mp-net.",AB_0157
"background: segmentation and evaluation of infarcts on medical images are essential for diagnosis and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke (ais). computed tomography (ct) is the first-choice examination for patients with ais. methods: to accurately segment infarcts from the ct images of patients with ais, we proposed an automated segmentation method combining the convolutional attention mechanism and residual deformable transformer in this article. the method used the encoder-decoder structure, where the encoders were employed for downsampling to obtain the feature of the images and the decoder was used for upsampling and segmentation. in addition, we further applied the convolutional attention mechanism and residual network structure to improve the e ectiveness of feature extraction. our code is available at: https://github.com/xzhixiang/ais-segmentation/tree/master. results: the proposed method was assessed on a public dataset containing 397 non-contrastct (ncct) images of ais patients (aisd dataset). the symptom onset to ct time was less than 24 h. the experimental results illustrate that this work had a dice coefficient (dc) of 58.66% for ais infarct segmentation, which outperforms several existing methods. furthermore, volumetric analysis of infarcts indicated a strong correlation (pearson correlation coefficient = 0.948) between the ais infarct volume obtained by the proposed method and manual segmentation. conclusion: the strong correlation between the infarct segmentation obtained via our method and the ground truth allows us to conclude that ourmethod could accurately segment infarcts from ncct images.",AB_0157
"place recognition is an important branch of simultaneous localization and mapping (slam), which finds revisited places, thereby reducing error accumulations. most mainstream methods only concentrate on the similarity of two lidar scans and cannot obtain the pose information. in this paper, we design a descriptor named occupied place description (opd) and propose an efficient map-aided place recognition and localization method. our method can effectively detect loop events, obtain the vehicle's poses, and overcome the overlap dependence of pairwise point cloud registration. it is composed of four modules. first, the map data generation is designed to store the map database as binary files. then, a trajectory initialization consisting of global search, local search, and trajectory score computation is proposed to determine the vehicle's initial poses. next, an online localization method is developed by combining descriptor similarity and kalman filtering, which only takes less than 5ms per localization. finally, loop events are detected based on pose information. exhaustive evaluations on kitti and mulran datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. the average absolute trajectory error (ate) is 0.5 m and the average relative rotation error is 2.7 degrees. f1 score measures the success rate of place recognition and our average maximum f1 score achieves nearly 0.987. the source code will be available in https://github.com/shipc-ai/occupied-place-description.",AB_0157
"integrating transformers and convolutional neural networks represents a crucial and cutting-edge approach for tackling medical image segmentation problems. nonetheless, the existing hybrid methods fail to fully leverage the strengths of both operators. during the patch embedding, the patch projection method ignores the two-dimensional structure and local spatial information within each patch, while the fixed patch size cannot capture features with rich representation effectively. moreover, the calculation of self-attention results in attention diffusion, hindering the provision of precise details to the decoder while maintaining feature consistency. lastly, none of the existing methods establish an efficient multi-scale modeling concept. to address these issues, we design the collaborative networks of transformers and convolutional neural networks (tc-conet), which is generally used for accurate 3d medical image segmentation. first, we elaborately design precise patch embedding to generate 3d features with accurate spatial position information, laying a solid foundation for subsequent learning. the encoder-decoder backbone network is then constructed by tc-conet in an interlaced combination to properly incorporate long-range dependencies and hierarchical object concepts at various scales. furthermore, we employ the constricted attention bridge to constrict attention to local features, allowing us to accurately guide the recovery of detailed information while maintaining feature consistency. finally, atrous spatial pyramid pooling is applied to high-level feature map to establish the concept of multi-scale objects. on five challenging datasets, including synapse, acdc, brain tumor segmentation, cardiac left atrium segmentation, and lung tumor segmentation, the extensive experiments demonstrate that tc-conet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of superiority, migration, and strong generalization. these illustrate in full the efficacy of the proposed transformers and convolutional neural networks combination for medical image segmentation. our code is freely available at: https://github.com/yongchen-exact/tc-conet.",AB_0157
