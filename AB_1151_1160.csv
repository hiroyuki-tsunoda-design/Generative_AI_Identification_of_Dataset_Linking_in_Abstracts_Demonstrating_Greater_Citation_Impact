"objective this study aimed to investigate the risk factors for aggravation of cervical alignment after posterior cervical foraminotomy (pcf) and to identify their relationships with kyphotic changes in cervical curvature.methods ninety-eight patients who underwent pcf for unilateral radiculopathy and received follow-up for more than 2 years were retrospectively reviewed. segmental cobb angle (sa), cervical cobb angle (ca), pfirrmann grade, forami- nal stenosis, and clinical outcomes including neck pain, arm pain, and neck disability index scores were assessed. radiological and clinical outcomes were compared between groups c (control group with kyphotic change in ca < 5 degrees) and k (kyphotic group with kyphotic change in ca >= 5 degrees). multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for kyphotic change >= 5 degrees after pcf.results group k was significantly older than group c (p = 0.002) and had a higher pfirrmann grade (p = 0.025). in group k, neck pain had significantly increased at last follow-up (p < 0.001). multivariate linear regression analysis re-vealed that kyphotic changes in ca were related to older age (p = 0.016, b = 0.420) and pfirrmann grade of the operative levels (p = 0.032, b = 4.560). preoperative hypolordosis was not an independent risk factor for kyphotic changes in ca. receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the cutoff value for kyphotic changes in patients with ca >= 5 degrees was pfirrmann grade 3.417 (p = 0.008).conclusions contrary to previous studies, preoperative hypolordosis was not a risk factor for kyphotic changes in ca after pcf. older patients with disc degeneration of pfirrmann grade iv or greater for should be carefully considered. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.8.spine22462",AB_0116
"background: oxiracetam may have a modest effect on preventing cognitive decline. exercise can also enhance cognitive function. this trial aims to investigate the effect of oxiracetam on post-stroke cognitive impairment and explore whether this effect is modified by exercise. furthermore, the mechanisms that mediate this effect will be investigated through a neural network analysis.methods: this is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase iv trial. patients who com-plained of cognitive decline 3 months after stroke and had a high risk of cognitive decline were eligible. patients were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of oxiracetam or placebo twice daily for 36 weeks. after randomization, a predetermined exercise protocol was provided to each participant, and the degree of physical activity was assessed using wrist actigraphy at 4, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. resting-state functional mri was ob-tained in baseline and 36-week follow-up. co-primary endpoints are changes in the mini-mental state exami-nation and clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes. secondary endpoints include changes in the ninds-csn vcihs-neuropsychology protocol, euro qol, patient's global assessment, and functional network connectivity. if there is a significant difference in physical activity between the two groups, the interaction effect between physical activity and the treatment group will be examined. a total of 500 patients were enrolled from february 2018, and the last patient's final follow-up was completed in september 2022.conclusion: this trial is meaningful not only to prove the efficacy of oxiracetam, but also evaluate whether ex-ercise can modify the effects of medication and how cognitive function can be restored. trial registration http://cris.nih.go.kr (kct0005137).",AB_0116
"background: although right-sided colon cancer is increasingly recognized as having a worse prognosis than left-sided colorectal cancer for colorectal liver metastases, little is known about the differences between the left-sided colon and rectum. objective: this study evaluated the prognostic value of primary tumor location in patients with colorectal liver metastases by examining the left-sided colon and rectum separately. design: this was a retrospective study from 2003 to 2017. settings: the study was conducted in a national cancer center hospital. patients: the study cohort included 489 patients with colorectal liver metastases from right-sided colon cancer (n = 119, 24%), left-sided colon cancer (n = 251, 51%), or rectal cancer (n = 119, 24%) who underwent hepatic resection. main outcome measures: primary outcomes were relapse-free survival and overall survival. results: five-year relapse-free survival rates for patients with right-sided colon cancer, left-sided colon cancer, and rectal cancer were 28.6%, 34.1%, and 26.4%, and 5-year overall survival rates were 53.9%, 70.3%, and 60.8%. multivariable analysis revealed significant differences in relapse-free survival and overall survival between left-sided colon cancer and rectal cancer (relapse-free survival: hr = 1.37, p = 0.03; overall survival: hr = 1.49, p = 0.03) and between left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer (relapse-free survival: hr = 1.39, p = 0.02; overall survival: hr = 1.60, p = 0.01), but not between right-sided colon cancer and rectal cancer. in patients with recurrence (n = 325), left-sided colon cancer had the lowest multiple-site recurrence rate and the highest surgical resection rate for recurrence (left-sided colon cancer, 20%/46%; right-sided colon cancer, 32%/30%; rectal cancer, 26%/39%). limitations: this study was retrospective in design. conclusions: rectal cancer was associated with worse relapse-free survival and overall survival compared with left-sided colon cancer in patients with colorectal liver metastases who underwent hepatic resection. our findings suggest that the left-sided colon and rectum should be considered distinct entities in colorectal liver metastases. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b882.",AB_0116
"weakly-supervised object localization (wsol) has gained popularity over the last years for its promise to train localization models with only image-level labels. since the seminal wsol work of class activation mapping (cam), the field has focused on how to expand the attention regions to cover objects more broadly and localize them better. however, these strategies rely on full localization supervision for validating hyperparameters and model selection, which is in principle prohibited under the wsol setup. in this paper, we argue that wsol task is ill-posed with only image-level labels, and propose a new evaluation protocol where full supervision is limited to only a small held-out set not overlapping with the test set. we observe that, under our protocol, the five most recent wsol methods have not made a major improvement over the cam baseline. moreover, we report that existing wsol methods have not reached the few-shot learning baseline, where the full-supervision at validation time is used for model training instead. based on our findings, we discuss some future directions for wsol. source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/clovaai/wsolevaluation https://github.com/clovaai/wsolevaluation.",AB_0116
"given a degraded input image, image restoration aims to recover the missing high-quality image content. numerous applications demand effective image restoration, e.g., computational photography, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing. significant advances in image restoration have been made in recent years, dominated by convolutional neural networks (cnns). the widely-used cnn-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on progressively low-resolution representations. in the former case, spatial details are preserved but the contextual information cannot be precisely encoded. in the latter case, generated outputs are semantically reliable but spatially less accurate. this paper presents a new architecture with a holistic goal of maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving complementary contextual information from the low-resolution representations. the core of our approach is a multi-scale residual block containing the following key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) non-local attention mechanism for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention based multi-scale feature aggregation. our approach learns an enriched set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details. extensive experiments on six real image benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, named as mirnet-v2, achieves state-of-the-art results for a variety of image processing tasks, including defocus deblurring, image denoising, super-resolution, and image enhancement. the source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/swz30/mirnetv2.",AB_0116
"in this paper, we identify and address a serious design bias of existing salient object detection (sod) datasets, which unrealistically assume that each image should contain at least one clear and uncluttered salient object. this design bias has led to a saturation in performance for state-of-the-art sod models when evaluated on existing datasets. however, these models are still far from satisfactory when applied to real-world scenes. based on our analyses, we propose a new high-quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark. specifically, our dataset, called salient objects in clutter (soc), includes images with both salient and non-salient objects from several common object categories. in addition to object category annotations, each salient image is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in common scenes, which can help provide deeper insight into the sod problem. further, with a given saliency encoder, e.g., the backbone network, existing saliency models are designed to achieve mapping from the training image set to the training ground-truth set. we therefore argue that improving the dataset can yield higher performance gains than focusing only on the decoder design. with this in mind, we investigate several dataset-enhancement strategies, including label smoothing to implicitly emphasize salient boundaries, random image augmentation to adapt saliency models to various scenarios, and self-supervised learning as a regularization strategy to learn from small datasets. our extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of these tricks. we also provide a comprehensive benchmark for sod, which can be found in our repository: https://github.com/dengpingfan/sodbenchmark",AB_0116
"the detection and segmentation of individual cells or nuclei is often involved in image analysis across a variety of biology and biomedical applications as an indispensable prerequisite. however, the ubiquitous presence of crowd clusters with morphological variations often hinders successful instance segmentation. in this paper, nuclei cluster focused annotation strategies and frameworks are proposed to overcome this challenging practical problem. specifically, we design a nucleus segmentation framework, namely clusterseg, to tackle nuclei clusters, which consists of a convolutional-transformer hybrid encoder and a 2.5-path decoder for precise predictions of nuclei instance mask, contours, and clustered-edges. additionally, an annotation-efficient clustered-edge pointed strategy pinpoints the salient and error-prone boundaries, where a partially-supervised ps-clusterseg is presented using clusterseg as the segmentation backbone. the framework is evaluated with four privately curated image sets and two public sets with characteristic severely clustered nuclei across a variety range of image modalities, e.g., microscope, cytopathology, and histopathology images. the proposed clusterseg and ps-clusterseg are modality-independent and generalizable, and superior to current state-of-the-art approaches in multiple metrics empirically. our collected data, the elaborate annotations to both public and private set, as well the source code, are released publicly at https://github.com/lu-yizhou/clusterseg.",AB_0116
"cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em) single-particle analysis is a revolutionary imaging technique to resolve and visualize biomacromolecules. image alignment in cryo-em is an important and basic step to improve the pre-cision of the image distance calculation. however, it is a very challenging task due to high noise and low signal-to-noise ratio. therefore, we propose a new deep unsupervised difference learning (udl) strategy with novel pseudo-label guided learning network architecture and apply it to pair-wise image alignment in cryo-em. the training framework is fully unsupervised. furthermore, a variant of udl called joint udl (judl), is also pro-posed, which is capable of utilizing the similarity information of the whole dataset and thus further increase the alignment precision. assessments on both real-world and synthetic cryo-em single-particle image datasets sug-gest the new unsupervised joint alignment method can achieve more accurate alignment results. our method is highly efficient by taking advantages of gpu devices. the source code of our methods is publicly available at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/jointudl/ for academic use.",AB_0116
"background: nanopore sequencing allows selective sequencing, the ability to programmatically reject unwanted reads in a sample. selective sequencing has many present and future applications in genomics research and the classification of species from a pool of species is an example. existing methods for selective sequencing for species classification are still immature and the accuracy highly varies depending on the datasets. for the five datasets we tested, the accuracy of existing methods varied in the range of similar to 77 to 97% (average accuracy < 89%). here we present deepselectnet, an accurate deep-learning-based method that can directly classify nanopore current signals belonging to a particular species. deepselectnet utilizes novel data preprocessing techniques and improved neural network architecture for regularization.results: for the five datasets tested, deepselectnet's accuracy varied between similar to 91 and 99% (average accuracy similar to 95%). at its best performance, deepselectnet achieved a nearly 12% accuracy increase compared to its deep learning-based predecessor squigglenet. furthermore, precision and recall evaluated for deepselectnet on average were always > 89% (average similar to 95%). in terms of execution performance, deepselectnet outperformed squigglenet by similar to 13% on average. thus, deepselectnet is a practically viable method to improve the effectiveness of selective sequencing.conclusions: compared to base alignment and deep learning predecessors, deepselectnet can significantly improve the accuracy to enable real-time species classification using selective sequencing. the source code of deepselectnet is available at https://github.com/anjanasenanayake/deepselectnet .",AB_0116
"ramachandran plots, which describe protein structures by plotting the dihedral angle pairs of the backbone on a two-dimensional plane, have played an important role in structural biology over the past few decades. however, despite continued discovery of new protein structures to date, the ramachandran plot is still constructed by only a small number of data points, and further it cannot reflect the steric information of proteins. here, we investigated the secondary structure of proteins in terms of static and dynamic characteristics. as for static feature, the ramachandran plot was revisited for the dataset consisting of 9,148 non-redundant high-resolution protein structures released in the protein data bank until april 1, 2022. by calculating amino acid propensities, it was found that the proportion of secondary structures with respect to residue depth is directly related to their hydrophobicity. as for dynamic feature, normal mode analysis (nma) based on an elastic network model (enm) was carried out for the dataset using our kosmos web server (http://bioengineering.skku.ac.kr/kosmos/). all enm-based nma results were stored in the kosmos database, allowing researchers to use them in various ways. in this process, it was commonly found that high b-factors appeared at the edge of the alpha helix region, which was elucidated by introducing residue depth. in addition, by investigating the change in dihedral angle, it was possible to quantitatively survey the contribution of structural change of protein on the ramachandran plot. in conclusion, our statistical analysis of protein characteristics will provide insight into a range of protein structural studies.",AB_0116
