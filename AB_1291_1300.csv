"introduction postoperative delirium (pod) is an acute, transient brain disorder associated with decreased postoperative quality of life, dementia, neurocognitive changes, and mortality. a small number of trials have explored the role of s-ketamine in the treatment of pod due to its neuroprotective effects. surprisingly, these trials have failed to yield supportive results. however, heterogeneity in delirium assessment methodologies, sample sizes, and outcome settings as well as deficiencies in s-ketamine use methods make the evidence provided by these studies less persuasive. given the severe impact of pod on the health of elderly patients and the potential for s-ketamine to prevent it, we believe that designing a large sample size, and rigorous randomized controlled trial for further evaluation is necessary.methods this is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic study. subjects undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention (n = 186) and placebo (n = 186) groups. this trial aims to explore the potential role of s-ketamine in the prevention of pod. its primary outcome is the incidence of pod within 3 postoperative days. secondary outcomes include the number of pod episodes, the onset and duration of pod, the severity and subtype of pod, pain scores and opioid consumption, sleep quality, clinical outcomes, and safety outcomes.discussion to our knowledge, this is the first pragmatic study that proposes to use s-ketamine to prevent pod. we reviewed a large body of literature to identify potential preoperative confounding variables that may bias associations between the intervention and primary outcome. we will use advanced statistical methods to correct potential confounding variables, improving the test's power and external validity of test results. of note, the patient population included in this trial will undergo intraspinal anesthesia. although large, multicenter, randomized controlled studies have found no considerable difference in the effects of regional and general anesthesia on pod, patients receiving intraspinal anesthesia have less exposure to at-risk drugs, such as sevoflurane, propofol, and benzodiazepines, than patients receiving general anesthesia. at-risk drugs have been shown to negatively interfere with the neuroprotective effects of s-ketamine, which may be the reason for the failure of a large number of previous studies. there is currently a lack of randomized controlled studies evaluating s-ketamine for pod prevention, and our trial helps to fill a gap in this area. trial registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier chictr2300075796.discussion to our knowledge, this is the first pragmatic study that proposes to use s-ketamine to prevent pod. we reviewed a large body of literature to identify potential preoperative confounding variables that may bias associations between the intervention and primary outcome. we will use advanced statistical methods to correct potential confounding variables, improving the test's power and external validity of test results. of note, the patient population included in this trial will undergo intraspinal anesthesia. although large, multicenter, randomized controlled studies have found no considerable difference in the effects of regional and general anesthesia on pod, patients receiving intraspinal anesthesia have less exposure to at-risk drugs, such as sevoflurane, propofol, and benzodiazepines, than patients receiving general anesthesia. at-risk drugs have been shown to negatively interfere with the neuroprotective effects of s-ketamine, which may be the reason for the failure of a large number of previous studies. there is currently a lack of randomized controlled studies evaluating s-ketamine for pod prevention, and our trial helps to fill a gap in this area. trial registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier chictr2300075796.",AB_0130
"background: epidemiologic and observational data have found a risk association between thyroid dysfunction and cutaneous malignant melanoma (cmm), however, the cause and direction of these effects are yet unknown. by using a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization (mr) methodology, we hoped to further investigate the causal link between thyroid dysfunction and cmm in this work. methods: a genome-wide association study (gwas) of 9,851,867 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in a european population was used to develop genetic tools for thyroid dysfunction. hypothyroidism was linked to 22,687 cases and 440,246 controls. for hyperthyroidism, there were 3545 cases and 459,388 controls. a total of 3751 cases and 372016 controls were included in the genetic data for cmm from uk biobank (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank) (the dataset: ieu -b -4969). among them, inverse variance weighting (ivw) is the main mr analysis method for causality assessment. mr-egger method, mr pleiotropic residual and outlier test (mr-presso), and simple and weighted median (vm) were used to supplement the ivw method. sensitivity analyses, mainly cochran's q test, leave-one-out analysis, and mr egger intercept test were performed to assess the robustness of the outcomes. results: the two-sample mr analysis results revealed a negative correlation between genetically predicted hypothyroidism and the probability of cmm (or=0.987, 95%ci =0.075-0.999, p=0.041). the supplemental mr analysis did not reveal any statistically significant differences, although the direction of the effect sizes for the other approaches was consistent with the ivw effect sizes. the results of the causal analysis were relatively robust, according to a sensitivity analysis. the risk of cmm was unaffected by hyperthyroidism (p>0.05). no correlation between cmm and thyroid dysfunction was seen in the reverse mr analysis. conclusion: although the magnitude of the causal association is weak and further investigation of the mechanism of this putative causal relationship is required, our findings imply that hypothyroidism may be a protective factor for cmm.",AB_0130
"n4-acetylcytidine (ac4c) is a modification of cytidine at the nitrogen-4 position, playing a significant role in the translation process of mrna. however, the precise mechanism and details of how ac4c modifies translated mrna remain unclear. since identifying ac4c sites using conventional experimental methods is both labor-intensive and time-consuming, there is an urgent need for a method that can promptly recognize ac4c sites. in this paper, we propose a comprehensive ensemble learning model, the stacking-based heterogeneous integrated ac4c model, engineered explicitly to identify ac4c sites. this innovative model integrates three distinct feature extraction methodologies: kmer, electron-ion interaction pseudo-potential values (pseeiip), and pseudo-k-tuple nucleotide composition (pseknc). the model also incorporates the robust cluster centroids algorithm to enhance its performance in dealing with imbalanced data and alleviate underfitting issues. our independent testing experiments indicate that our proposed model improves the mcc by 15.61% and the roc by 5.97% compared to existing models. to test our model's adaptability, we also utilized a balanced dataset assembled by the authors of irna-ac4c. our model showed an increase in sn of 4.1%, an increase in acc of nearly 1%, and roc improvement of 0.35% on this balanced dataset. the code for our model is freely accessible at https://github.com/louliliang/st-ac4c.git, allowing users to quickly build their model without dealing with complicated mathematical equations.",AB_0130
"introductionhypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. uncontrolled nocturnal blood pressure is prevalent in patients taking antihypertensive medication, with an incidence rate of 30-60%. although chronotherapy with antihypertensive agents may provide a new direction for effective control of nocturnal blood pressure, the clinical evidence base remains controversial. this research is presently underway to compare the effects of morning and bedtime administration of antihypertensive medication on nocturnal reduction and circadian rhythm of blood pressure in patients with hypertension.methods and analysisthis study is being performed as a randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, clinical trial in which 720 participants are to undergo 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement (abpm) and office blood pressure measurement (obpm) at baseline before being randomly assigned to a morning (6-10 am) or a bedtime (6-10 pm) administration group. each participant receives one 20/5-mg tablet of olmesartan/amlodipine (oa) daily for 4 weeks and is then followed up at 4-week intervals for a total of 12 weeks. during follow-up, the oa dosage is adjusted according to the abpm and obpm results. patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the first follow-up visit will receive an increase in oa dosage to 1.5 tablets/day. for patients with blood pressure that is still uncontrolled after a further 4 weeks, the dosage of oa can be increased to 2 tablets/day. the primary objective is the reduction in mean nocturnal systolic blood pressure between baseline and week 12. the secondary objectives are the reduction in ambulatory blood pressure at weeks 4 and 12 and the blood pressure control rate at weeks 4, 8, and 12.discussionantihypertensive chronotherapy remains controversial. a superiority test hypothesis design has been adopted for this trial, in which all participants will be taking the same antihypertensive medication. we anticipate that our findings will determine if nocturnal blood pressure control in chinese patients with essential hypertension varies according to whether antihypertensive medication is taken in the morning or at bedtime. this study may provide scientific evidence for the application of chronotherapy in clinical practice.trial registrationchictr2200059719. registered on 10 may 2022(http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit.aspx?pid=169782&htm=4) {2a,2b}trial registrationchictr2200059719. registered on 10 may 2022(http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit.aspx?pid=169782&htm=4) {2a,2b}",AB_0130
"backgroundmany patients during manual therapy after anterior ligament reconstruction will experience severe pain, which has a negative impact on their rehabilitation. however, there is rarely an analgesic method for these patients during rehabilitation. nitrous oxide with rapid analgesic and sedative effects is often used to relieve pain in minor procedures. the purpose of this study is to determine whether or not nitrous oxide analgesia decreases pain compared to oxygen during manual therapy after anterior ligament reconstruction.methods/designthis single-center, randomized, double-blind and controlled trial will recruit 120 patients. patients >= 18 years old undergoing manual therapy after anterior ligament reconstruction (1 month post-operative) with acute pain (vas >= 4) are included. the main exclusion criteria included the following: pulmonary embolism, intestinal obstruction, pneumothorax. patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention group (a) and the control group (b) in a ratio of 1:1. doctors, therapists, patients, and data collectors are all blind to the study. the manual therapy will be performed by therapists. nurses who implemented the intervention handed the doctors envelopes containing the patients' codes and allocation of a or b. group a will receive a pre-prepared nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture plus conventional treatment (no analgesic) given as 30-min treatment sessions, once daily, and group b will receive oxygen plus conventional treatment (no analgesic) under the same conditions. assessments will be taken 2 min before the intervention (t0), 5 min after the beginning of the intervention (t1), and 5 min after the intervention finished (t2). the primary outcome is pain score. secondary outcomes include vital signs, side effects, joint range of motion, adjuvant analgesia need, therapist and patient satisfaction, and whether willing to receive the same gas again.expected outcomeswe expect nitrous oxide inhalation to have a beneficial effect on the pain of patients who receive manual therapy after anterior ligament reconstruction.discussionif this treatment appears beneficial, it could improve patients' satisfaction and quality of life potentially and even be implemented widely in hospital and rehabilitation settings.trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov identifier, chictr2200061175 (version 2.0 june 15, 2022), https://www.chictr.org.cn.",AB_0130

"accurate crop mapping is of great significance for crop yield forecasting, agricultural productivity development and agricultural management. thanks to its all-time and all-weather capability, integrating multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (sar) for crop mapping has become essential and challenging task in remote sensing. in recent years, deep learning (dl) has demonstrated excellent crop mapping accuracy to interpret crop dynamics. however, existing dl-based methods tend to be incapable of capturing spatial and temporal features at different scales simultaneously, and this often leads to severe mis-classification due to the complex and heterogeneous distribution of crops and diverse phenological patterns. in this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal multi-level attention method, named as stma, for crop mapping using time-series sar imagery in an end-to-end fashion to increase the capability of crop phenology retrieval. specifically, the multilevel attention mechanism is designed to aggregate multi-scale spatio-temporal representations on crops via cascaded spatio-temporal self-attention (stsa) and multi-scale cross-attention (mca) modalities. to ensure a fine extraction of multi-granularity features, a learnable spatial attention position encoding is proposed to adaptively generate the position priors to facilitate multi-level attention learning. experimental results on brandenburg sentinel-1 dataset, public pastis-r dataset and south africa dataset demonstrated that stma can achieve state-of-the-art performance in crop mapping tasks, with the accuracy of 96.54% in the brandenburg sentinel-1 dataset, 86.77% in the pastis-r dataset and 83.37% in the south africa dataset, validating its effectiveness and superiority. further comparison of spatio-temporal generalization capability reflected its excellent performance in spatio-temporal modeling on different crops and scenarios. this research provides a viable and intelligent spatio-temporal framework for large-area crop mapping using time-series sar imagery in complex agricultural systems. the brandenburg sentinel-1 dataset and the stma code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hanzhu97702/isprs_stma.",AB_0130

"real-time driving distraction detection has garnered significant attention due to its potential to build various driving safety protections such as distraction warnings and driver assistance systems. recent studies have focused on the development of neural networks for vision-based detection, though achieving a balance between performance and efficiency has proven challenging. in this paper, we propose a novel constrained attention (ca) mechanism for real-time driver distraction detection, which aims to achieve better performance meanwhile ensuring the computation efficiency. specifically, we conduct some case studies by generating class activation maps to check the model attention, and three potential factors affecting performance are mined, which are ambiguous attention signal, excessive attention region, and similar attention between different classes. two regularization terms are designed to optimize the three obstacles. firstly, a concentrative regularization is introduced to limit the size of the attention region, meanwhile, pixels in the region have clear attention degrees. secondly, an orthogonal regularization is proposed to optimize the attention of different classes to be discriminative. to further inspiring the model, we design an intersample constraint, which optimizes the attention of images with the same ground truth to be similar. experiments are conducted on two driver distraction detection datasets, and the experimental results showed that our ca mechanism can bring significant performance improvement. more importantly, there will be no additional computational burden when the trained model is deployed in actual scenarios. codes are released at https://github.com/ gaohangcodes/can4ddd.",AB_0130
