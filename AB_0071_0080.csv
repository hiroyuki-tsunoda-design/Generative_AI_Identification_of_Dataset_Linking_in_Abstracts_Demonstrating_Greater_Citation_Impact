"much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. the core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. the string database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. the data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. all of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. the data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. the most recent developments in string (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell rna-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. furthermore, string continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.",AB_0008
"the interpro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) provides an integrative classification of protein sequences into families, and identifies functionally important domains and conserved sites. here, we report recent developments with interpro (version 90.0) and its associated software, including updates to data content and to the website. these developments extend and enrich the information provided by interpro, and provide a more user friendly access to the data. additionally, we have worked on adding pfam website features to the interpro website, as the pfam website will be retired in late 2022. we also show that interpro's sequence coverage has kept pace with the growth of uniprotkb. moreover, we report the development of a card game as a method of engaging the non-scientific community. finally, we discuss the benefits and challenges brought by the use of artificial intelligence for protein structure prediction.",AB_0008
"orthodb provides evolutionary and functional annotations of genes in a diverse sampling of eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. genomics continues to accelerate our exploration of gene diversity and orthology is the most precise way of bridging gene functional knowledge with the rapidly expanding universe of genomic sequences. orthodb samples the most diverse organisms with the best quality genomics data to provide the leading coverage of species diversity. this update of the underlying data to over 18 000 prokaryotes and almost 2000 eukaryotes with over 100 million genes propels the coverage to another level. this achievement also demonstrates the scalability of the underlying orthologer software for delineation of orthologs, freely available from https://orthologer.ezlab.org . in addition to the ab-initio computations of gene orthology used for the orthodb release, the orthologer software allows mapping of novel gene sets to precomputed orthologs and thereby links to their annotations. the lemmi-style benchmarking of orthologer ensures its state-of-the-art performance and is available from https://lemortho.ezlab.org. the orthodb web interface has been further developed to include a pairwise orthology view from any gene to any other sampled species. orthodb-computed evolutionary annotations as well as extensively collated functional annotations can be accessed via rest api or sparql/rdf, downloaded or browsed online from https://www.orthodb.org.",AB_0008
"characterization of the specific expression and chromatin profiles of genes enables understanding how they contribute to tissue/organ development and the mechanisms leading to diseases. whilst the number of single-cell sequencing studies is increasing dramatically; however, data mining and reanalysis remains challenging. herein, we systematically curated the up-to-date and most comprehensive datasets of sequencing data originating from 2760 bulk samples and over 5.1 million single-cells from multiple developmental periods from humans and multiple model organisms. with unified and systematic analysis, we profiled the gene expression and chromatin accessibility among 481 cell-types, 79 tissue-types and 92 timepoints, and pinpointed cells with the co-expression of target genes. we also enabled the detection of gene(s) with a temporal and cell-type specific expression profile that is similar to or distinct from that of a target gene. additionally, we illustrated the potential upstream and downstream gene-gene regulation interactions, particularly under the same biological process(es) or kegg pathway(s). thus, tedd (temporal expression during development database), a value-added database with a user-friendly interface, not only enables researchers to identify cell-type/tissue-type specific and temporal gene expression and chromatin profiles but also facilitates the association of genes with undefined biological functions in development and diseases. the database url is https://tedd.obg.cuhk.edu.hk/..",AB_0008
"this paper describes cosmogattice, a modern package for lattice simulations of the dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge fields in an expanding universe. cosmogattice incorporates a series of features that makes it very versatile and powerful: i) it is written in c++ fully exploiting the object oriented programming paradigm, with a modular structure and a clear separation between the physics and the technical details, ii) it is mpi-based and uses a discrete fourier transform parallelized in multiple spatial dimensions, which makes it specially appropriate for probing scenarios with well -separated scales, running very high resolution simulations, or simply very long ones, iii) it introduces its own symbolic language, defining field variables and operations over them, so that one can introduce differential equations and operators in a manner as close as possible to the continuum, iv) it includes a library of numerical algorithms, ranging from o(delta t(2)) to o(delta t(10)) methods, suitable for simulating global and gauge theories in an expanding grid, including the case of 'self-consistent' expansion sourced by the fields themselves. relevant observables are provided for each algorithm (e.g. energy densities, field spectra, lattice snapshots) and we note that, remarkably, all our algorithms for gauge theories (abelian or non-abelian) always respect the gauss constraint to machine precision. program summary program title:: cosmogattice cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /44vr5xssc6 .1 developer's repository link: http://github .com /cosmolattice /cosmolattice licensing provisions: mit programming language: c++, mpi nature of problem: the phenomenology of high energy physics in the early universe is typically characterized by non-linear dynamics, which cannot be captured accurately with analytical techniques. in order to fully understand the non-linearities developed in a given scenario, one needs to carry out lattice simulations. a number of public packages for lattice simulations have appeared over the years, but most of them are only capable of simulating scalar fields. however, realistic models of particle physics do contain other kind of field species, such as (abelian or non-abelian) gauge fields, whose non-linear dynamics can also play a relevant role in the early universe. tensor modes representing gravitational waves are also naturally expected in many scenarios. solution method: cosmogattice represents a modern code for lattice simulations of scalar-gauge field theories in an expanding universe. it allows for the simulation of the evolution of interacting (singlet) scalar fields, charged scalar fields under u(1) and/or su(2) gauge groups, and the corresponding associated abelian and/or non-abelian gauge fields. from version 1.1 onward, cosmogattice also allows to simulate the production of gravitational waves. simulations can be done either in a flat space-time background, or in a homogeneous and isotropic (spatially flat) expanding flrw background. cosmogattice provides symplectic integrators, with accuracy ranging from o (delta t(2)) up to o(delta t(10)), to simuate the non-linear dynamics of the appropriate fields in comoving three-dimensional lattices. the code is parallelized with mpi, and uses a discrete fourier transform parallelized in multiple spatial dimensions, which makes it a very powerful code for probing physical problems with well-separated scales. moreover, the code has been designed as a `platform' to implement any system of dynamical equations suitable for discretization on a lattice.

"in stereoscope-based minimally invasive surgeries (mis), dense stereo matching plays an indispensable role in 3d shape recovery, ar, vr, and navigation tasks. although numerous deep neural network (dnn) approaches are proposed, the conventional prior-free approaches are still popular in the industry because of the lack of open-source annotated data set and the limitation of the task-specific pre-trained dnns. among the prior-free stereo matching algorithms, there is no successful real-time algorithm in none gpu environment for mis. this paper proposes the first cpu-level real-time prior-free stereo matching algorithm for general mis tasks. we achieve an average 17 hz on 640*480 images with a single-core cpu (i5-9400) for surgical images. meanwhile, it achieves slightly better accuracy than the popular elas. the patch-based fast disparity searching algorithm is adopted for the rectified stereo images. a coarse-to-fine bayesian probability and a spatial gaussian mixed model were proposed to evaluate the patch probability at different scales. an optional probability density function estimation algorithm was adopted to quantify the prediction variance. extensive experiments demonstrated the proposed method's capability to handle ambiguities introduced by the textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency from the non-lambertian reflectance and dark illumination. the estimated probability managed to balance the confidences of the patches for stereo images at different scales. it has similar or higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline elas in mis, while it is 4-5 times faster. the code and the synthetic data sets are available at https://github.com/jingweisong/bdis-v2.",AB_0008
"breast cancer has become a common malignancy in women. however, early detection and identification of this disease can save many lives. as computer-aided detection helps radiologists in detecting abnormalities efficiently, researchers across the world are striving to develop reliable models to deal with. one of the common approaches to identifying breast cancer is through breast mammograms. however, the identification of malignant breasts from mass lesions is a challenging research problem. in the current work, we propose a method for the classification of breast mass using mammograms which consists of two main stages. at first, we extract deep features from the input mammograms using the well-known vgg16 model while incorporating an attention mechanism into this model. next, we apply a meta-heuristic called social ski-driver (ssd) algorithm embedded with adaptive beta hill climbing based local search to obtain an optimal features subset. the optimal features subset is fed to the k-nearest neighbors (knn) classifier for the classification. the proposed model is demonstrated to be very useful for identifying and differentiating malignant and healthy breasts successfully. for experimentation, we evaluate our model on the digital database for screening mammography (ddsm) database and achieve 96.07% accuracy using only 25% of features extracted by the attention-aided vgg16 model. the python code of our research work is publicly available at: https://github.com/ppayel/breastlocalsearchssd.",AB_0008
"in multi-agent reinforcement learning, multiple agents learn simultaneously while interacting with a common environment and each other. since the agents adapt their policies during learning, not only the behavior of a single agent becomes non-stationary, but also the environment as perceived by the agent. this renders it particularly challenging to perform policy improvement. in this paper, we propose to exploit the fact that the agents seek to improve their expected cumulative reward and introduce a novel time dynamical opponent model (tdom) to encode the knowledge that the opponent policies tend to improve over time. we motivate tdom theoretically by deriving a lower bound of the log objective of an individual agent and further propose multi-agent actor-critic with time dynamical opponent model (tdom-ac). we evaluate the proposed tdom-ac on a differential game and the multi-agent particle environment. we show empirically that tdom achieves superior opponent behavior prediction during test time. the proposed tdom-ac methodology outperforms state-of-the-art actor-critic methods on the performed tasks in cooperative and especially in mixed cooperative-competitive environments. tdom-ac results in a more stable training and a faster convergence. our code is available at https:// github.com/yuantian013/tdom-ac.(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0008
"ultra-fine-grained visual categorization (ultra-fgvc) moves down the taxonomy level to classify sub -granularity categories of fine-grained objects. this inevitably poses a challenge, i.e., classifying highly similar objects with limited samples, which impedes the performance of recent advanced vision trans-former methods. to that end, this paper introduces mix-vit, a novel mixing attentive vision transformer to address the above challenge towards improved ultra-fgvc. the core design is a self-supervised mod-ule that mixes the high-level sample tokens and learns to predict whether a token has been substi-tuted after attentively substituting tokens. this drives the model to understand the contextual discrim-inative details among inter-class samples. via incorporating such a self-supervised module, the net-work gains more knowledge from the intrinsic structure of input data and thus improves generaliza-tion capability with limited training sample. the proposed mix-vit achieves competitive performance on seven publicly available datasets, demonstrating the potential of vision transformer compared to cnn for the first time in addressing the challenging ultra-fgvc tasks. the code is available at https://github.com/markin-wang/mixvit (c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0008
"rna binding proteins (rbps) are central regulators of gene expression implicated in all facets of rna metabolism. as such, they play key roles in cellular physiology and disease etiology. since different steps of post-transcriptional gene expression tend to occur in specific regions of the cell, including nuclear or cytoplasmic locations, defining the subcellular distribution properties of rbps is an important step in assessing their potential functions. here, we present the rbp image database, a resource that details the subcellular localization features of 301 rbps in the human hepg2 and hela cell lines, based on the results of systematic immuno-fluorescence studies conducted using a highly validated collection of rbp antibodies and a panel of 12 markers for specific organelles and subcellular structures. the unique features of the rbp image database include: (i) hosting of comprehensive representative images for each rbp-marker pair, with similar to 250,000 microscopy images; (ii) a manually curated controlled vocabulary of annotation terms detailing the localization features of each factor; and (iii) a user-friendly interface allowing the rapid querying of the data by target or annotation. the rbp image database is freely available at https://rnabiology.ircm.qc.ca/rbpimage/.",AB_0008
