"resting-state functional mri (rs-fmri) is widely used to examine the dynamic brain functional development of infants, but these studies typically require precise cortical parcellation maps, which cannot be directly borrowed from adult-based functional parcellation maps due to the substantial differences in functional brain organization between infants and adults. creating infant-specific cortical parcellation maps is thus highly desired but remains challenging due to difficulties in acquiring and processing infant brain mris. in this study, we leveraged 1064 high-resolution longitudinal rs-fmris from 197 typically developing infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months who participated in the baby connectome project to develop the first set of infant-specific, fine-grained, surface-based cortical functional parcellation maps. to establish meaningful cortical functional correspondence across individuals, we performed cortical co-registration using both the cortical folding geometric features and the local gradient of functional connectivity (fc). then we generated both age-related and age-independent cortical parcellation maps with over 800 fine-grained parcels during infancy based on aligned and averaged local gradient maps of fc across individuals. these parcellation maps reveal complex functional developmental patterns, such as changes in local gradient, network size, and local efficiency, especially during the first 9 postnatal months. our generated fine-grained infant cortical functional parcellation maps are publicly available at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/infantsurfatlas/ for advancing the pediatric neuroimaging field.",AB_0155
"this study proposes a uniform passive fault-tolerant control (ftc) method for a quadcopter that does not rely on fault information subject to one, two adjacent, two opposite, or three rotor failure. the uniform control implies that the passive ftc is able to cover the condition from quadcopter fault-free to rotor failure without the need for controller switching. to achieve the purpose of passive ftc, the fault of rotors is modeled as a lumped disturbance acting on the virtual control of the quadcopter system. the estimated disturbance is used directly in the passive ftc. at the same time, a modified controller structure is designed to achieve the passive ftc ability for two and three rotor failure. to avoid the control allocation switching from the fault-free control to the ftc, a dynamic control allocation is used. in addition, the closed-loop stability is analyzed in the presence of up to three rotor failure. to validate the proposed uniform passive ftc method, outdoor experiments are performed for the first time, which have demonstrated that the hovering quadcopter is able to recover from one rotor failure using the proposed controller and resume its mission even if two adjacent, two opposite, or three rotors fail, without the need for any rotor fault information or controller switching. experimental results can be viewed in this video: https://youtu.be/n1oudpxfxne. source code is placed on https://github.com/rflybuaa/degradedcontrol.git",AB_0155
"background: single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) technology has revolutionized the study of cell heterogeneity and biological interpretation at the single-cell level. however, the dropout events commonly present in scrna-seq data can markedly reduce the reliability of downstream analysis. existing imputation methods often overlook the discrepancy between the established cell relationship from dropout noisy data and reality, which limits their performances due to the learned untrustworthy cell representations. method: here, we propose a novel approach called the cl-impute (contrastive learning-based impute) model for estimating missing genes without relying on preconstructed cell relationships. cl-impute utilizes contrastive learning and a self-attention network to address this challenge. specifically, the proposed cl-impute model leverages contrastive learning to learn cell representations from the self-perspective of dropout events, whereas the self-attention network captures cell relationships from the global-perspective. results: experimental results on four benchmark datasets, including quantitative assessment, cell clustering, gene identification, and trajectory inference, demonstrate the superior performance of cl-impute compared with that of existing state-of-the-art imputation methods. furthermore, our experiment reveals that combining contrastive learning and masking cell augmentation enables the model to learn actual latent features from noisy data with a high rate of dropout events, enhancing the reliability of imputed values. conclusions: cl-impute is a novel contrastive learning-based method to impute scrna-seq data in the context of high dropout rate. the source code of cl-impute is available at https://github.com/yuchen21-web/imputation-for-scrna-seq.",AB_0155
"in order to increase feed utilization and reduce rearing costs, it is crucial to accurately detect remaining pellets in real-time and optimize feeding mechanisms for precise feeding in intensive aquaculture. machine vision and acoustic methods, which are widely used for the detection of residual particles, fail to adequately address sce-narios such as the detection of overlapping, conjoined, faraway and dense particles, as well as particles with interference from water surface ripples and fish motion. to address these issues, this paper proposed a model for uneaten feed detection based on you only look once (yolo)-v5 network, which was built as follows: (1) the last c3 module of the backbone network is introduced into the coordinated attention (ca) mechanism, which evolves into a coordinated feature attention extraction (cfae) module to obtain global information. (2) the gsconv module, and the vovgscsp module which was the aggregative mode of gsconv module, were adopted in the neck network part. (3) the shallow feature map was spliced with the deep feature map, and the tiny target detection layer (dl) was added for detection. the model elucidates the true condition of the detected residual particles by enhancing detection accuracy and minimizing model complexity, enabling precise and rapid iden-tification of the pellet. this article employs seven sets of data to conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes achieved before and after enhancing the three major components of the network. the experimental results showed that the yolov5s-cagsdl model achieved an accuracy of 94.1% for feed particles detection, effectively solving the above problems in the actual rearing environment. meanwhile, compared with the yolov5s model, ap50 and fps of the yolov5s-cagsdl model were increased by 6.30% and 10.80% respectively, bringing po-tential environmental and economic benefits in the actual aquaculture environment. the source codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/aaaarmstrong/yolov5s-cagsdl.",AB_0155
"to reduce energy consumption (ec) in the wastewater treatment process (wwtp) for achieving energy conservation and emission reduction, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (moea) applied in wwtp needs to have better convergence and diversity. in this paper, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii based on utopian point improvement (nsgaiii-up) is proposed, which overcomes the disadvantage that multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on utopian point decomposition (moea/d-up) cannot handle the multi-segment discontinuous pareto front (pf) problem well. by comparing the proposed nsgaiii-up with 8 advanced algorithms by 2 metrics on 22 benchmark functions, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in dealing with the complex pf problems is proved. moreover, a multivariable model predictive controller (mmpc) is used to control the dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in wwtp, in which nsgaiii-up is applied to the upper ec optimization of wwtp. the simulation results show that compared with the closed-loop control, the ec in the wwtp is reduced by 7.395 %, and the lowest ec is achieved compared with the other 8 algorithms. it helps to reduce energy waste in wwtp and promotes ecological sustainability. the source code of nsgaiii-up is publicly available at https://github.com/sut16/nsgaiii-up.",AB_0155
"crash detection is of great significance for traffic emergency management. video-based approaches can effectively save the manpower monitoring cost and have achieved promising results in recent studies. however, they sometimes fail to correctly identify crashes in congested traffic. to fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel appearance-motion network for improving video-based crash detection performance in congested traffic. the appearance-motion network utilizes two paralleled convolutional networks (i.e., an appearance network and a motion network) to extract both appearance features and motion features of crashes. to learn discriminative appearance features for differentiating crashes in congested traffic scene (cct) with non-crashes in congested traffic scene (ncct), an auxiliary network combined with a triplet loss are introduced to train the appearance network. to better capture crash motion features in congested traffic, an optical flow learner is built in the motion network and trained to extract more fine-grained motion information. moreover, a temporal attention module is applied to enable the motion network to focus on valuable frames. experimental results show that the proposed network achieves a state-of-the-art result on crash detection and the introduction of the three components (i.e., the auxiliary network, the optical flow learner and the temporal attention module) effectively reduces false alarm rate by 28.07% and miss rate by 27.08% on crash detection in congested traffic. our dataset will be available at https://github.com/vvgoder/dataset_for_crashdetection.",AB_0155
"background amnesic mild cognitive impairment (amci) is the main subtype of mild cognitive impairment (mci) and has the highest risk of conversion to alzheimer's disease (ad) among all mci subtypes. episodic memory impairment is the early cognitive impairment of amci, which has become an important target for ad prevention. previous clinical evidence has shown that acupuncture can improve the cognitive ability of mci patients. this experiment aimed to observe the efficacy and neural mechanism of tiaoshenyizhi acupuncture on the episodic memory of patients with amci. methods in this multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 360 amci participants will be recruited from six subcenters and randomly assigned to the acupuncture group, sham acupuncture group, and control group. the acupuncture group will receive tiaoshenyizhi (tsyz) acupuncture, the sham acupuncture group will use streitberger sham acupuncture, and the control group will only receive free health education. participants in the two acupuncture groups will receive real acupuncture treatment or placebo acupuncture three times per week, 24 sessions over 8 consecutive weeks. the primary outcome will be global cognitive ability. secondary outcomes will be a specific cognitive domain, including episodic memory and execution ability, electroencephalogram, and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. outcomes will be measured at baseline and the fourth and eighth weeks after randomization. repeated measurement analysis of variance and a mixed linear model will be used to observe the intervention effect. discussion the protocol will give a detailed procedure to the multicenter clinical trial to further evaluate the efficacy and neural mechanism of tiaoshenyizhi acupuncture on episodic memory in patients with amci. from this research, we expect to provide clinical evidence for early amci management. trial registration http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit.aspx?pid=142612&htm=4, identifier: chictr2100054009.",AB_0155
"abs t r a c t a visual single-object tracker is an indispensable component of underwater vehicles (uvs) in marine organism grasping tasks. its accuracy and stability are imperative to guide the uvs to perform grasping behavior. although single-object trackers show competitive performance in the challenge of underwater image degradation, there are still issues with sample imbalance and exclusion of similar objects that need to be addressed for application in marine organism grasping. this paper proposes underwater ostrack (uostrack), which consists of underwater image and open-air sequence hybrid training (uoht), and motion-based post-processing (mbpp). the uoht training paradigm is designed to train the sample-imbalanced underwater tracker so that the tracker is exposed to a great number of underwater domain training samples and learns the feature expressions. the mbpp paradigm is proposed to exclude similar objects. it uses the estimation box predicted with a kalman filter and the candidate boxes in the response map to relocate the lost tracked object in the candidate area. uostrack achieves an average performance improvement of 4.41% and 7.98% maximum compared to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks, respectively. field experiments have verified the accuracy and stability of our proposed uostrack for uvs in marine organism grasping tasks. more details can be found at https://github.com/li yunfenglyf/uostrack.",AB_0155
"the goal of remote sensing image (rsi) instance segmentation is to perform instance-level semantic parsing of its contents. aside from classifying and locating regions of interest (roi), it also requires assigning finer pixel -wise annotations to objects. however, rsi often suffers from cluttered backgrounds, variable object scales, and complex object edge contours, making the instance segmentation task more challenging. in this work, we analytically customize an instance segmentation model that is more suitable for rsi. specifically, we propose three novel modules for a region-based instance segmentation framework, namely channel-spatial attention module (csa), multi-scale aware module (msa), and semantic relation learning module (srl). among them, feature calibration performed by csa can alleviate the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics in both channel and spatial dimensions. inheriting the capabilities of both the convolutional neural network (cnn) and the transformer, srl can help the network integrate both neighborhood features and long-range dependencies for instance semantic prediction. the msa module designs a cascaded residual structure with different receptive fields to model the scale variation of objects in rsi. experimental results on challenging isaid, nwpu vhr-10, ssdd, bittc and hrsid datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving mask aps of 40.2%, 68.2%, 68.4%, 50.4% and 55.8% respectively. code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/sherlock1018/rsiisn.",AB_0155
"as a challenging task in the field of unsupervised learning, incomplete multi-view clustering can fully utilize multi-view information in the absence of partial views. nevertheless, most existing methods still suffer from the following two limitations: (1) the missing views are ignored in matrix factorization or self-representation learning, which might not effectively explore the complementary information of incomplete views. (2) they fail to mine the high-order inter-view relationships in consensus graph learning, which can directly affect the accuracy of the learned consensus graph. to this end, this paper proposes an effective consensus learning model, referred to as tensor-based consensus learning for incomplete multi-view clustering (tclimc). specifically, in tclimc, the missing views of incomplete instances are reconstructed, and the reconstructed views are devoted to exploring the consensus latent representation shared by all views and self-representation of each view. meanwhile, the consensus graph learning is enhanced by combining self-representation learning and tensor low-rank constraint. in addition, the consensus latent representation and consensus graph are correlated by graph regularization, which enhances the compactness of the consensus latent representation and the accuracy of the consensus graph. at last, the clustering results on eight incomplete multi-view datasets verify the effectiveness of tclimc. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/jsmmu/tclimc.",AB_0155
