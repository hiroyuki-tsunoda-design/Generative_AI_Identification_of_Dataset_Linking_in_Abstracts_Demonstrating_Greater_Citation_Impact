"motivation: discrete features can be obtained from protein sequences using a feature extraction method. these features are the basis of downstream processing of protein data, but it is necessary to screen and select some important features from them as they generally have data redundancy.result: here, we report iifs, an improved incremental feature selection method that exploits a new subset search strategy to find the optimal feature set. iifs combines nonadjacent sorting features to prevent the drawbacks of data explosion and excessive reliance on feature sorting results. the comparative experimental results on 27 feature sorting data show that iifs can find more accurate and important features compared to existing methods. the iifs approach also handles data redundancy more efficiently and finds more representative and discrimi-natory features while ensuring minimal feature dimensionality and good evaluation metrics. moreover, we wrap this method and deploy it on a web server for access at http://112.124.26.17:8005/.",AB_0133
"while deep neural networks (dnns) have made remarkable advancements in various fields recently, the latest research indicates that dnns are susceptible to disruptions from minor perturbations. however, conventional physical attacks employing stickers as physical perturbations to deceive classifiers encounter challenges in achieving stealthiness and are susceptible to issues such as printing quality loss. recent advancements in physical attacks have harnessed light beams to execute attacks, producing artificial optical patterns rather than natural ones. in this study, we introduce a black-box projector-based physical attack called adversarial color projection (advcp), which manipulates the physical parameters of color projection to execute adversarial attacks. advcp revolves around three pivotal criteria: effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. in a digital environment, our approach attains an impressive attack success rate of 97.60% on a subset of imagenet.in the physical realm, we achieve a remarkable 100% attack success rate in indoor testing and 82.14% in outdoor testing. to underscore the stealthiness of our approach, we juxtapose the adversarial samples generated by advcp with baseline samples. when applied to challenge advanced and robust dnns, our experimental results reveal that our method achieves an attack success rate exceeding 85% across most all of the models, establishing the robustness of advcp. finally, we contemplate the potential threats posed by advcp to future vision-based systems and applications, and proffer some innovative concepts pertaining to light-based physical attacks. our code can be accessed from the following link: https://github.com/chengyinhu/advcp.git",AB_0133
"purpose - due to high speeds, heavy loads, large slide-to-roll ratios (srr) and other variable operating conditions, some rolling bearings that have been working in harsh conditions may experience flash temperatures in the contact area, which may result in early damage like smearing and then affect service life. this study aims to investigate the flash temperature phenomenon of rolling bearings through theoretical and experimental analysis. design/methodology/approach - a technology for measuring temperature distribution in rolling ball on disk contact under lubrication was developed. the test-rig can simulate the ball bearing contact. the effects of working conditions such as entrainment speed, load, srr and lubricating oil viscosity on the flash temperature were investigated. findings - the results of the theoretical calculation and experiments indicate that the parameters promoting the reduction of film thickness in elastohydrodynamic lubrication are always related with the number of flash points, even film thickness reduced to mixed lubrication. the flash temperature is easier to happen in conditions of high srr, heavy load, slow entrainment speed and low viscosity oil. originality/value - this work conducts an experimental study on the flash temperature phenomenon, providing a test technology for bearing lubrication and failure investigation. peer review - this author has opted into transparent peer review available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-04-2023-0104",AB_0133
"recently, visual understanding using unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications, including delivery, security investigation and surveillance. however, most existing uav-based datasets only capture color images under ideal illumination and weather conditions, typically sunny days. this limitation fails to account for the complexity of real-world scenarios, such as cloudy or foggy weather, and nighttime conditions. deep learning methods trained on color images with good lighting and weather conditions struggle to adapt to the complex visual scenes in these scenarios. moreover, color images may not provide sufficient visual information under the complex visual scenes. to bridge this gap and meet the demands of real-world applications, we propose a large-scale rgb-thermal domain-incremental object detection (rtdod) dataset in this paper. our dataset includes rgb and thermal videos synchronously captured using calibrated color thermal cameras mounted on uavs. it covers various weather conditions, from sunny to foggy to rainy, and spans from day to night. we sample and obtain approximately 16,200 pairs of images, and manually label dense annotations, including object bounding boxes and object categories. with the proposed dataset, we introduce a challenging domain-incremental object detection task. we also present a baseline approach that uses task-related gates to filter features for knowledge distillation to reduce forgetting. experimental results on the rtdod dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in domain-incremental object detection. to facilitate future research and development in domain-incremental object detection tasks on aerial images, the rtdod dataset and our baseline model are made available at https://github.com/fenght96/rtdod. article info.",AB_0133
"purposethis study aims to form composite solid lubricant coatings on the surface of bearing steel, which can significantly improve the tribological properties of thrust cylindrical roller bearings (tcrbs). phosphating films possess microscopic porosity that typically needs to be sealed with oil, grease or wax. due to its unique crystal structure, the phosphating film itself also exhibits a certain degree of lubricity. in this study, solid lubricants are used to fill the pores of the phosphating film. by combining the phosphating film with solid lubricants, lubrication and wear reduction can be achieved.design/methodology/approachin this study, the surfaces of the shaft washer (ws) and seat washer (gs) were treated with zinc-phosphating. subsequently, a solid lubricant solution (polytetrafluoroethylene [ptfe], mos2 and graphite) was sprayed onto the phosphated samples at concentrations of 1 , 2 and 3 g/l. the porous and adsorptive nature of the phosphating film was used to embed the solid lubricant particles into the film, thus forming a composite lubrication layer containing solid lubricants on the surface of the bearing steel.findingsthe addition of solid lubricant materials has shown significant potential in reducing wear losses compared with phosphated samples without such additives. increasing the amount of solid lubricant added can facilitate the formation of a transfer film, which further enhances the protective properties. however, it is important to note that excessive amounts of solid lubricant material can contribute to seizure, leading to increased wear losses of the cage and a higher average coefficient of friction (acof).by spraying a ptfe solution with a concentration of 2 g/l, the lowest acof and cage wear loss were achieved, resulting in reductions of 60.5% for the acof and 89.4% for the cage wear loss. similarly, when spraying a graphite solution with a concentration of 3 g/l, the lowest wear losses for gs and ws were observed, with reductions of 51.7% for gs wear loss and 38.9% for ws wear loss.originality/valuethe combination of the phosphating film and solid lubricants aims to achieve lubrication and wear reduction, providing a new approach to wear-resistant technology for tcrbs.peer reviewthe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-07-2023-0231/",AB_0133
"real-time detection of green citrus fruit is crucial for accurate fruit localization and early yield prediction in the citrus growing process. this detection involves three imaging steps: acquisition, transmission, and detection. image quality during acquisition and transmission also impacts detection accuracy. to enhance accuracy, we propose a lightweight method for detecting green citrus fruit in practical environments. the method applies a random sequence of four operations (blurred kernel, noise, size reduction, and compression) to preprocess original citrus fruit images, simulating real-world blurring and constructing a new dataset. a knowledge model is trained to reconstruct blurry citrus fruit images and address accuracy issues caused by blurring in practical environments. the yolov5 backbone network combines a convolutional neural network (cnn) for local information and a transformer for global background features. this fusion encodes both local and global information, learning representations efficiently and improving the detection model. in the yolov5 neck network, feature weighting optimizes representation of citrus fruit in space and channels, enhancing accuracy by reducing background weight. the proposed method, evaluated using a constructed dataset, outperforms mainstream lightweight detection models with 93.6% accuracy, 6.3 m parameters, and a 12.4 m model size. compared to yolov5-mobilenetv3-small and yolov5-shufflenetv2, accuracy improves by 8.5% and 10.98%, respectively. compared to yolov5s, parameters decrease by 9.6%, model size decreases by 8.82%, and accuracy improves by 1.5%. the proposed method demonstrates robust and effective detection of green citrus fruit in natural environments, providing guidance for accurate localization and early yield prediction. data and methods used in this paper can be found at: https://github.com/pingfuchen/citrus_detection.git.",AB_0133
"semantic segmentation is a crucial task in the field of computer vision, and medical image segmentation, as its downstream task, has made significant breakthroughs in recent years. however, the issue of requiring a large number of annotations in medical image segmentation has remained a major challenge. semi-supervised semantic segmentation has provided a powerful approach to address the annotation problem. nevertheless, existing semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods in medical images have drawbacks, such as insufficient exploitation of unlabeled data information and inefficient utilization of all pseudo-label information. we introduces a novel segmentation model, the feature similarity and reliable-region enhancement network (fsrenet), to overcome these limitations. firstly, this paper proposes a feature similarity module (fsm), which combines the dense feature prediction ability of true labels for unlabeled images with segmentation features as additional constraints, utilizing the similarity relationship between dense features to constrain segmentation features, and thus fully exploiting the dense feature information of unlabeled data. additionally, the reliable-region enhancement module (rem) designs a high-confidence network structure by fusing two networks that can learn from each other, forming a triple-network structure. the high-confidence network generates reliable pseudo-labels that further constrain the predictions of the two networks, achieving the goal of enhancing the weight of reliable regions, reducing the noise interference of pseudo-labels, and efficiently utilizing all pseudo-label information. experimental results on the acdc and la datasets demonstrate that the fsrenet model proposed in this paper excels in the task of semi-supervised semantic segmentation of medical images and outperforms the majority of existing methods. our code is available at: https://github.com/gdghds0/fsrenet-master.",AB_0133
