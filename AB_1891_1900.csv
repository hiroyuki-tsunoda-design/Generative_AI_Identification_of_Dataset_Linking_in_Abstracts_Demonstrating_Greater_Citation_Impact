"the lochkovian, pragian, and basal part of the emsian, which represent the post-kwangsian orogeny strata in the south china block, are mainly composed of siliciclastic rocks. this lithological composition impedes investigation of pragian and lochkovian conodont biostratigraphy in the south china block, which results in a persistent controversy on the age of relevant lithological units. the present study provides new evidence by reporting for the first time lochkovian conodonts obtained from the south china block, specifically the gaoling member of the nahkaoling formation at the lingli section, central guangxi. the conodont fauna, consisting of pandorinellina exigua lingliensis lu n. subsp., pandorinellina exigua exigua, zieglerodina? tuojiangensis lu n. sp., amydrotaxis praejohnsoni, and eognathodus cf. e. irregularis, places the studied interval of the gaoling member in the lower or middle lochkovian (contingent upon varying definitions for the base of the middle lochkovian) to lower pragian. moreover, amydrotaxis praejohnsoni, which was reported previously only in north america and eastern australia, is herein also recorded in the south china block, and thus may play an important role in intercontinental biostratigraphical correlation. by shedding light on the age of the upper limit of the underlying lianhuashan formation at the lingli section, the present study indicates that the kwangsian orogeny ended before the late lochkovian. this date is slightly earlier than the previously estimated late lochkovian based on studies of fossil plants from the siliciclastic rocks deposited after the kwangsian orogeny.uuid: http://zoobank.org/8010f983-4f6f-43dd-949f-de4653e53d9d",AB_0190
"ketosis is considered to be the most important metabolic disease affecting dairy herds, surpassing ruminal acidosis and milk fever. on dairy farms, assessment and monitoring of ketosis risk are necessary for the health management of dairy cows. changes in the content of hematological and serum biochemical parameters are commonly used to monitor ketosis in dairy cows. however, the collection and detection of these indicators are complex and may lead to stress reactions in cows. this study attempted to predict the risk of ketosis in dairy cows using machine learning models based on noninvasive prenatal indicators of parity, body condition score, dystocia score, daily rumination time, daily activity, and season of calving. results showed the extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) model had the highest prediction ability and the most accuracy, compared to random forest (rf), support vector machine (svm), artificial neural network (ann), and k-nearest neighbor (knn). in the xgboost model, daily rumination time (60.15%) and daily activity (16.73%) were identified with the highest percentage contribution to the model, followed by parity (10.41%), body condition score (6.42%), season of calving (4.23%), and dystocia score (2.06%). the probability of ketosis increased with decreasing daily rumination time and daily activity. moreover, parity 3+ and summer may also increase the probability of ketosis. finally, an open shiny web application for predicting the risk of ketosis in dairy cows based on the xgboost model was developed (https://2xzl2o-neaop.shinyapps.io/precowketosis/). the application precowketosis can provide decision support for researchers and farmers to prevent ketosis in dairy cows.",AB_0190
"background propensity score analysis is increasingly used to control for confounding factors in observational studies. unfortunately, unavoidable missing values make estimating propensity scores extremely challenging. we propose a new method for estimating propensity scores in data with missing values. materials and methods both simulated and real-world datasets are used in our experiments. the simulated datasets were constructed under 2 scenarios, the presence (t = 1) and the absence (t = 0) of the true effect. the real-world dataset comes from lalonde's employment training program. we construct missing data with varying degrees of missing rates under three missing mechanisms: mar, mcar, and mnar. then we compare mtnn with 2 other traditional methods in different scenarios. the experiments in each scenario were repeated 20,000 times. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ljwa2323/mtnn. results under the three missing mechanisms of mar, mcar and mnar, the rmse between the effect and the true effect estimated by our proposed method is the smallest in simulations and in real-world data. furthermore, the standard deviation of the effect estimated by our method is the smallest. in situations where the missing rate is low, the estimation of our method is more accurate. conclusions mtnn can perform propensity score estimation and missing value filling at the same time through shared hidden layers and joint learning, which solves the dilemma of traditional methods and is very suitable for estimating true effects in samples with missing values. the method is expected to be broadly generalized and applied to real-world observational studies.",AB_0190
"generative adversarial nets (gans) have enjoyed considerable success in computer vision and attracted much attention from recommender systems. however, due to the discrete nature of items, it is infeasible to graft gans directly onto recommendation models. although several methods have taken steps forward, their training processes are slow-convergent, time-consuming, or even unstable. this article proposes a novel framework named attentive adversarial collaborative filtering (aacf) and an efficient training strategy to improve gans in recommender systems. there are two distinct novelties over previous work. first, aacf is a differentiable generative adversarial framework that introduces an attention mechanism and virtual items to bridge the gap between the generator and the discriminator. owing to the intrinsic differentiability, aacf can be stably optimized with gradient descent methods. second, the efficient training strategy substantially reduces computational complexity. it is capable of efficiently training and scaling up the aacf model to large datasets. extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, fast convergence, stability, and scalability of aacf. since our ideas are general in nature, they will open a path to stably and efficiently train gans in the research areas with discrete data. the implementation code is available at https://github.com/zhongchuansun/aacf.",AB_0190
"currently, among the link prediction researches based on low-rank representation, almost none of literature has considered how to select an appropriate base-matrix and the impact of the structural characteristics of the reconstructed network on the link prediction. therefore, in this paper, we use the adjacency matrix of the fully connected network (fcn) as the base-matrix for low-rank representation, and any local structure of the observed networks can be represented by the interactions of fcn structures. to explore the properties of link predictions, the nuclear norm of the adjacency matrix for the reconstructed network is taken as a penalty term in the newly proposed low-rank representation objective function. according to the optimal interactive coefficients achieved by solving the novel objective function, in this paper, we design a novel link prediction algorithm (lrnp algorithm) and its optimized algorithm (olrnp algorithm). experimental results based on real networks and synthetic networks lead to several conclusions. (1) the lrnp algorithm has good convergence properties. when changing the parameters of the lrnp algorithm, the changes along prediction performance do not exceed 9.48%. lrnp also performs well for sparse networks. (2) compared with baseline link prediction algorithms, lrnp also shows excellent performance, and its auc and precision can increase by 14.35% and 14.89%. (3) the olrnp algorithm exhibits better performance than the lrnp algorithm, and its auc and precision can rise by up to 7.50% and 6.79%, respectively. the data and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/pinglanchu/l rnp-olrnp.",AB_0190
"backgroundfibrosarcoma is a rare sarcoma of the soft tissue in adults, occurring most commonly in the extremities. this study aimed to construct two web-based nomograms to predict overall survival (os) and cancer-specific survival (css) in patients with extremity fibrosarcoma (ef) and validate it with multicenter data from the asian/chinese population. methodpatients with ef in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database between 2004 and 2015 were included in this study and were randomly divided into a training cohort and a verification cohort. the nomogram was developed based on the independent prognostic factors determined by univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard regression analyses. the predictive accuracy of the nomogram was validated with the harrell's concordance index (c-index), receiver operating curve, and calibration curve. decision curve analysis (dca) was utilized to compare the clinical usefulness between the novel model and the existing staging system. resulta total of 931 patients finally were obtained in our study. multivariate cox analysis determined five independent prognostic factors for os and css, namely, age, m stage, tumor size, grade, and surgery. the nomogram and the corresponding web-based calculator were developed to predict os (https://orthosurgery.shinyapps.io/osnomogram/) and css (https://orthosurgery.shinyapps.io/cssnomogram/) probability at 24, 36, and 48 months. the c-index of the nomogram was 0.784 in the training cohort and 0.825 in the verification cohort for os and 0.798 in the training cohort and 0.813 in the verification cohort for css, respectively, indicating excellent predictive performance. the calibration curves showed excellent agreement between the prediction by the nomogram and actual outcomes. additionally, the results of dca showed that the newly proposed nomogram was significantly better than the conventional staging system with more clinical net benefits. the kaplan-meier survival curves showed that patients assigned into the low-risk group had a more satisfactory survival outcome than the high-risk group. conclusionin this study, we constructed two nomograms and web-based survival calculators including five independent prognostic factors for the survival prediction of patients with ef, which could help clinicians make personalized clinical decisions.",AB_0190
"background and objective: automatic thymoma segmentation in preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (cect) images makes great sense for diagnosis. although convolutional neural networks (cnns) are distinguished in medical image segmentation, they are challenged by thymomas with various shapes, scales and textures, owing to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations. in order to overcome this deficit, we built a deep learning network with enhanced global-awareness for thymoma segmentation.methods: we propose a multi-level global-aware network (mg-net) for thymoma segmentation, in which the multi-level feature interaction and integration are jointly designed to enhance the global-awareness of cnns. particularly, we design the cross-attention block (cab) to calculate pixel-wise interactions of multi-level features, resulting in the global enhanced convolution block, which can enable the network to handle various thymomas by strengthening the global-awareness of the encoder. we further devise the global spatial attention module to integrate coarse- and fine-grain information for enhancing the semantic consistency between the encoder and decoder with cabs. we also develop an adaptive attention fusion module to adaptively aggregate different semantic-scale features in the decoder to preserve comprehensive details. results: the mg-net has been evaluated against several state-of-the-art models on the self-collected cect dataset and nih pancreas-ct dataset. results suggest that all designed components are effective, and mg-net has superior segmentation performance and generalization ability over existing models.conclusion: both the qualitative and quantitative experimental results indicate that our mg-net with globalaware ability can achieve accurate thymoma segmentation and has generalization ability in different tasks. the code is available at: https://github.com/leejyuan/mgnet.",AB_0190
"marine biological resources are abundant, and the reasonable development, research and protection of marine biological resources are of great significance to marine ecological health and economic development. at present, underwater object quantitative detection plays a very important role in marine biological science research, marine species richness survey, and rare species conservation. however, the problems of a large amount of noise in the underwater environment, small object scale, dense biological distribution, and occlusion all increase the detection difficulty. in this paper, a detection algorithm mad-yolo (multiscale feature extraction and attention feature fusion reinforced yolo for marine benthos detection) is proposed, which is based on improved yolov5 is proposed to solve the above problems. to improve the adaptability of the network to the underwater environment, vovdarknet is designed as the feature extraction backbone. it uses the intermediate features with different receptive fields to reinforce the ability to extract feature. afc-pan is proposed as the feature fusion network so that the network can learn correct feature information and location information of objects at various scales, improving the network's ability to perceive small objects. label assignment strategy simota and decoupled head are introduced to help the model better handles occlusion and dense distribution problems. experiments show the mad-yolo algorithm increases map0.5:0.95 on the urpc2020 dataset from 49.8% to 53.4% compared to the original yolov5. moreover, the advantages of the model are visualized and analyzed by the method of controlling variables in the experimental part. the experiments show that mad-yolo is suitable for detecting blurred, dense, and small-scale objects. the model performs well in marine benthos detection tasks and can effectively promote marine life science research and marine engineering implementation. the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/joenan1/mad-yolo.",AB_0190
"background: ipaf (ice-protease activating factor) is a nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (nlr) protein known as the cysteine-associated recruitment domain 12 (card12). previous studies only discuss the role of ipaf inflammasomes in specific tumors. the role of ipaf inflammasomes in pan-cancer is still unclear. therefore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of ipaf inflammasome in 33 tumors.methods: we used databases like the cancer genome atlas (tcga) and genotype-tissue expression (gtex) from the ucsc xena (http://xena.ucsc.edu/) to retrieve and analyze gene expression. the influence of ipaf inflammasome on the prognosis of tumor patients was analyzed using univariate cox regression analysis and kaplan-meier survival analysis. furthermore, we conducted the following analysis: single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, single-cell level functional state analysis, single-cell sequencing, immune cell infiltration analysis, and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (tide) score.results: first, the differential expression of ipaf inflammasome-related genes (ipaf-rgs) in 33 tumors were analyzed. the results revealed that ipaf-rgs were significantly and differentially expressed in eight tumors. the prognostic significance of ipaf inflammasome scores was different in different tumors. a positive correlation was observed between ipaf inflammasomes scores and cd8+ t cells in most tumors. further analysis revealed that ipaf inflammasome might affect tumor immunity mainly by mediating effector t cell recruitment via the expression of chemokines such as cxcl9, cxcl10, and ccl5. the analysis of tide and ipaf inflammasome scores revealed a significant negative correlation between ipaf inflammasome and tide scores in 11 tumors. conclusion: a pan-cancer analysis of ipaf inflammasome in various tumors was performed. the results highlight the potential value of ipaf inflammasome in response to immunotherapy in patients and provide a new direction for future immunotherapy.",AB_0190
"backgroundlung metastases (lm) have a poor prognosis of osteosarcoma. this study aimed to predict the risk of lm using the nomogram in patients with osteosarcoma. methodsa total of 1100 patients who were diagnosed as osteosarcoma between 2010 and 2019 in the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (seer) database were selected as the training cohort. univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent prognostic factors of osteosarcoma lung metastases. 108 osteosarcoma patients from a multicentre dataset was as valiation data. the predictive power of the nomogram model was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves (roc) and calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (dca) was utilized to interpret the accurate validity in clinical practice. resultsa total of 1208 patients with osteosarcoma from both the seer database(n=1100) and the multicentre database (n=108) were analyzed. univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that survival time, sex, t-stage, n-stage, surgery, radiation, and bone metastases were independent risk factors for lung metastasis. we combined these factors to construct a nomogram for estimating the risk of lung metastasis. internal and external validation showed significant predictive differences (auc 0.779, 0.792 respectively). calibration plots showed good performance of the nomogram model. conclusionsin this study, a nomogram model for predicting the risk of lung metastases in osteosarcoma patients was constructed and turned out to be accurate and reliable through internal and external validation. moreover we built a webpage calculator (https://drliwenle.shinyapps.io/oslm/) taken into account nomogram model to help clinicians make more accurate and personalized predictions.",AB_0190
