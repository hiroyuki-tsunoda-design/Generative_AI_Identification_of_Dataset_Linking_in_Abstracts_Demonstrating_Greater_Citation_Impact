"multi-object tracking (mot) is an important task of computer vision which has a wide range of applications. existing multi-object tracking methods mostly employ the kalman filter to predict the object location in the next frame. however, if the video is captured by a camera with significant motion variation or contains objects moving at non-constant speed, the kalman filter may fail. in addition, although object occlusion has been studied extensively in mot, it has not been well addressed yet. to deal with these problems, a joint detection and tracking method named visibility-guided tracking for mot (vgt-mot) is proposed in this paper. specifically, to cope with the difficulty of accurate object position estimation caused by drastic camera or object motion variation, vgt-mot utilizes an adjacent-frame object location prediction network with inter-frame attention to predict the target position in the next frame. to handle object occlusion, vgt-mot employs the object visibility as a dynamic weight to adaptively fuse the motion and appearance similarities and update the object appearance representation. the proposed vgt-mot has been evaluated on the mot16, mot17 and mot20 datasets. the results show that vgt-mot compares favorably against state-of-the-art mot approaches. the source code of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/wang-ironman/vgt-mot.",AB_0162
"background: intersphincteric resection is the ultimate sphincter-preserving surgical technique for ultralow rectal cancer, but quality-of-life changes after surgery remain unclear. it is also unknown which questionnaire has better associations with functional results for capturing clinical variation in quality of life. objective: this study aimed to assess change in the quality of life and its correlation with functional outcomes among patients undergoing intersphincteric resection for ultralow rectal cancer. design: this was a prospective, observational, single-center study. settings: colorectal surgery referral center. patients: patients with ultralow rectal cancer who underwent intersphincteric resection were included. main outcome measures: the primary outcomes were quality-of-life and functional results at 3 to 6, 12, and 24 months after ileostomy closure using validated questionnaires. the secondary outcome was the relationship between quality of life and neorectal function. results: a total of 102 patients (62.7% men) completed follow-up surveys. wexner incontinence score and kirwan's incontinence score significantly improved at 12 months after ileostomy reversal, but such improvement in low anterior resection syndrome score was proved until 24 months later (p = 0.01). condition-specific quality-of-life domains improved over time, with significant changes in lifestyle (p = 0.02) and coping/behavior (p = 0.01), as well as the summary score of fecal incontinence quality of life ( p = 0.02) and visual analog scale score (p < 0.001). among health-related quality-of-life domains, the subscale scores did not differ significantly. the functional systems scores were significantly correlated with all the domains of condition-specific quality-of-life but only a few health-related quality-of-life domains. only weak to moderate associations with the functional outcomes were observed for both quality-of-life questionnaires. limitations: single-center data and limited sample size. conclusions: although low anterior resection syndrome persists for years after intersphincteric resection, condition-specific quality of life and functional outcomes improve over time. compared to health-related quality-of-life questionnaires, condition-specific quality-of-life instruments might be preferable to evaluate changes in quality-of-life after surgery. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c130.",AB_0162
"skeleton-based action recognition has attracted more and more attention due to its advantage in avoiding environmental noise including light transformations and viewpoint changing. most current approaches consist of interleaving spatial-only modules and temporal-only modules, where messages are first spatially aggregated between human joints and then temporally delivered. although efficient, such factorized design hinders direct information flow among joints in adjacent frames, thus failing to (1) effectively convey information in a larger neighborhood and (2) be inferior to capture short-term motion to distinguish similar action pairs. to handle these limitations, we propose spatial-temporal graph attention network (stgat) to dynamically model local cross-spacetime information. keeping the temporal-only modules unchanged, it inflates the spatial only modules to perform spatial-temporal modeling from the local spatial-temporal neighborhood without a second transmission cost. especially, different from previous spatial-temporal modeling methods, graph edges are adaptively computed to dynamically aggregate beneficial information to capture short-term movements, getting rid of predefined fixed connectivity. this ensures stgat could dynamically attend to important joints in a local spatial-temporal neighborhood to capture critical short-term movements. while stgat is theoretically effective in introducing local spatial-temporal information by comprising a large spatial-temporal neighborhood, we find its effectiveness is impeded by the inherent redundancy in local features. we propose three simple modules to reduce local feature redundancy to calibrate the feature modeling schema and further release the potential of stgat, which (1) narrow the scope of self-attention operators, (2) dynamically weight joints along the temporal dimension, and (3) separate subtle motion from static features, respectively. as a result, stgat achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets: ntu rgb+d 60, ntu rgb+d 120, and kinetics skeleton 400. thanks to special care on local cross-spacetime information, stgat generalizes better upon classifying hard similar actions than previous methods. visualizations demonstrate that stgat could intelligently attend to critical joints when dealing with different actions. code is available at https://github.com/hulianyuyy/stgat.",AB_0162
"background in the causal analysis of observational studies, covariates should be carefully balanced to approximate a randomized experiment. numerous covariate balancing methods have been proposed for this purpose. however, it is often unclear what type of randomized experiments the balancing approaches aim to approximate; and this may cause ambiguity and hamper the synthesis of balancing characteristics within randomized experiments.methods randomized experiments based on rerandomization, known for significant improvement on covariate balance, have recently gained attention in the literature, but no attempt has been made to integrate this scheme into observational studies for improving covariate balance. motivated by the above concerns, we propose quasi-rerandomization, a novel reweighting method, where observational covariates are rerandomized to be the anchor for reweighting such that the balanced covariates obtained from rerandomization can be reconstructed by the weighted data.results through extensive numerical studies, not only does our approach demonstrate similar covariate balance and comparable estimation precision of treatment effect to rerandomization in many situations, but it also exhibits advantages over other balancing techniques in inferring the treatment effect.conclusion our quasi-rerandomization method can approximate the rerandomized experiments well in terms of improving the covariate balance and the precision of treatment effect estimation. furthermore, our approach shows competitive performance compared with other weighting and matching methods. the codes for the numerical stud-ies are available at https:// github. com/ bobzh anght/ qrer.",AB_0162
"calibration of out-of-focus cameras is crucial for some special 3d reconstruction applications. an essential factor in improving the calibration result is avoiding the solution's singularity which tends to pose the calibration plate at a large inclination. however, the depth of field (dof) of cameras is limited, especially in the defocused scenes, and the blurred corners will significantly reduce the calibration accuracy. a vision-guided calibration method is proposed, including an optimal pose selection algorithm and an iterative phase-target technology. compared with other phase-target methods, this method simultaneously optimizes the mathematical properties of the solution and the angular uncertainty of the corners. compared with the chessboard-target or circle-target, this method has a higher calibration accuracy at three different distances that gradually change from focusing to defocusing. in addition, experiments also prove the effectiveness of the two submodules: gaussian iteration and vision guidance. finally, its code is available in the url: https://github.com/shu-flyman/visual-guidence-ca libration.",AB_0162
"background: it is widely accepted that traumatic brain injury (tbi) increases the risk of developing long-term dementia, although some controversies surrounding this topic exist. annually, approximately 69 million individuals suffer from tbi all around the world. such a large population of tbi patients could lead to a future surge in the number of dementia patients. due to the potentially severe consequences of tbi, various research projects on post-tbi dementia have emerged worldwide. therefore, it is essential to comprehend the current status and development of post-tbi dementia for future research. objective: the purpose of the study was to provide an overview of the field and identify hotspots, research frontiers, and future research trends for post-tbi dementia. methods: articles related to post-tbi dementia were retrieved from the web of science core collection for the period between 2007 and 2022, and analyzing them based on factors such as citations, authors, institutions, countries, journals, keywords, and references. data analysis and visualization were conducted using vosviewer, citespace, and an online bibliometric platform (https://bibliometric.com). results: from 2007 to 2022, we obtained a total of 727 articles from 3,780 authors and 1,126 institutions across 52 countries, published in 262 journals. these articles received a total of 29,353 citations, citing 25,713 references from 3,921 journals. over the last 15 years, there has been a significant upward trend in both publications and citations. the most productive country was the united states, the most productive institution was boston university, and the most productive author was mckee ac. journal of neurotrauma has been identified as the periodical with the greatest number of publications. three clusters were identified through cluster analysis of keywords. a burst in the use of the term outcome in 2019 is indicative of a future research hotspot. the timeline view of references showed 14 clusters, of which the first 4 clusters collected the majority of papers. the first 4 clusters were chronic traumatic encephalopathy, age of onset, tauopathy, and cognitive decline, respectively, suggesting some areas of interest in the field. conclusion: the subject of post-tbi dementia has raised much interest from scientists. notably, america is at the forefront of research in this area. further collaborative research between different countries is imperative. two topical issues in this field are the association between tbi and dementia-related alterations and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (cte). studies on clinical manifestation, therapy, pathology, and pathogenic mechanisms are also popular in the field.",AB_0162
"feature extraction is the most fundamental step when analyzing liquid chromatography-mass spec-trometry (lc-ms) datasets. however, traditional methods require optimal parameter selections and re -optimization for different datasets, thus hindering efficient and objective large-scale data analysis. pure ion chromatogram (pic) is widely used because it avoids the peak splitting problem of the extracted ion chromatogram (eic) and regions of interest (rois). here, we developed a deep learning-based pure ion chromatogram method (deeppic) to find pics using a customized u-net from centroid mode data of lc-ms directly and automatically. a model was trained, validated, and tested on the arabidopsis thaliana dataset with 200 input-label pairs. deeppic was integrated into kpic2. the combination enables the en-tire processing pipeline from raw data to discriminant models for metabolomics datasets. the kpic2 with deeppic was compared against other competing methods (xcms, featurefindermetabo, and peakonly) on the mm48, simulated mm48, and quantitative datasets. these comparisons showed that deeppic outper-forms xcms, featurefindermetabo, and peakonly in recall rates and correlation with sample concentra-tions. five datasets of different instruments and samples were used to evaluate the quality of pics and the universal applicability of deeppic, and 95.12% of the found pics could precisely match their manually labeled pics. therefore, kpic2 + deeppic is an automatic, practical, and off-the-shelf method to extract fea-tures from raw data directly, exceeding traditional methods with careful parameter tuning. it is publicly available at https://github.com/yuxuanliao/deeppic.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0162
"existing solutions for road surface monitoring have assumed that events (both normal and abnormal) have a defined duration, and these methods fail to provide a universal framework that can be used to assess the quality of roads in real-world scenarios where events do not have to be of fixed duration. this article aims to improve road quality assessment systems by overcoming the constraint of fixed window size and taking into account the real-world scenario of variable-length events. first, we annotate a big heterogeneous data set without partitioning it into fixed-size windows. second, we suggest two distinct approaches for detecting and characterizing anomalies utilizing deep learning architectures comprising bi-directional lstm units. the first strategy is sequence classification (using a many to one correspondence to classify the entire sequence), and the second approach is endpoint detection (classify each time step as a normal or anomalous event using a many to many approach). the solutions presented in this article are intended for use with non-anomalous (normal) signals as well as with four distinct types of anomalies: cat-eyes, manholes, potholes, and speed bumps. our sequence classification model (bi-lstm model) is capable of detecting anomalies with a 97.3% true positive rate when the anomalies are considered a positive class. on the other hand, our end-point detection framework is able to mark the exact end-point of anomalous signals with a true positive rate of 90.2% as shown in ii. our dataset and annotation are publicly available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ 1qf-4d6p9oeu-yw3yc3uy55v7wdcwiumi",AB_0162
"the properties of drugs may undergo changes when multiple drugs are co-administered to treat co-existing or complex diseases, potentially leading to unforeseen drug-drug interactions (ddis). therefore, predicting potential drug-drug interactions has been an important task in pharmaceutical research. however, the following challenges remain: (1) existing methods do not work very well in cold-start scenarios, and (2) the interpretability of existing methods is not satisfactory. to address these challenges, we proposed a multichannel feature fusion method based on local substructure features of drugs and their complements (lsfc). the local substructure features are extracted from each drug, interacted with those of another drug, and then integrated with the global features of two drugs for ddi prediction. we evaluated lsfc on two real-world ddi datasets in worm-start and cold-start scenarios. comprehensive experiments demonstrate that lsfc consistently improved ddi prediction performance compared with the start-of-the-art methods. moreover, visual inspection results showed that lsfc can detect crucial substructures of drugs for ddis, providing interpretable ddi prediction. the source codes and data are available at https://github.com/zhang-yang-ops/lsfc.",AB_0162
"background lung adenocarcinoma (luad) seriously threatens people's health worldwide. programmed cell death (pcd) plays a critical role in regulating luad growth and metastasis as well as in therapeutic response. however, currently, there is a lack of integrative analysis of pcd-related signatures of luad for accurate prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response. methods the bulk transcriptome and clinical information of luad were obtained from tcga and geo databases. a total of 1382 genes involved in regulating 13 various pcd patterns (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, netotic cell death, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, parthanatos, autophagy-dependent cell death, oxeiptosis, alkaliptosis and disulfidptosis) were included in the study. weighted gene co-expression network analysis ( wgcna) and differential expression analysis were performed to identify pcd-associated differential expression genes (degs). an unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to explore the potential subtypes of luad based on the expression profiles of pcd-associated degs. univariate cox regression analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression, random forest (rf) analysis and stepwise multivariate cox analysis were performed to construct a prognostic gene signature. the oncopredict algorithm was utilized for drug-sensitive analysis. gsva and gsea were utilized to perform function enrichment analysis. mcpcounter, quantiseq, xcell and ssgsea algorithms were used for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. a nomogram incorporating pcdi and clinicopathological characteristics was established to predict the prognosis of luad patients. results forty pcd-associated degs related to luad were obtained by wgcna analysis and differential expression analysis, followed by unsupervised clustering to identify two luad molecular subtypes. a programmed cell death index (pcdi) with a five- gene signature was established by machine learning algorithms. luad patients were then divided into a high pcdi group and a low pcdi group using the median pcdi as a cutoff. survival and therapeutic analysis revealed that the high pcdi group had a poor prognosis and was more sensitive to targeted drugs but less sensitive to immunotherapy compared to the low pcdi group. further enrichment analysis showed that b cell-related pathways were significantly downregulated in the high pcdi group. accordingly, the decreased tumor immune cell infiltration and the lower tumor tertiary lymphoid structure (tls) scores were also found in the high pcdi group. finally, a nomogram with reliable predictive performance pcdi was constructed by incorporating pcdi and clinicopathological characteristics, and a user-friendly online website was established for clinical reference ( https://nomogramiv.shinyapps.io/nomogrampcdi/). conclusion we performed the first comprehensive analysis of the clinical relevance of genes regulating 13 pcd patterns in luad and identified two luad molecular subtypes with distinct pcd-related gene signature which indicated differential prognosis and treatment sensitivity. our study provided a new index to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the prognosis of luad patients for guiding personalized treatments.",AB_0162
