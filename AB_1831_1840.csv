"fast and proper treatment of the tautomeric states for drug-like molecules is critical in computer-aided drug discovery since the major tautomer of a molecule determines its pharmacophore features and physical properties. we present moltaut, a tool for the rapid generation of favorable states of drug-like molecules in water. moltaut works by enumerating possible tautomeric states with tautomeric transformation rules, ranking tautomers with their relative internal energies and solvation energies calculated by ai-based models, and generating preferred ionization states according to predicted microscopic pka. our test shows that the ranking ability of the ai-based tautomer scoring approach is comparable to the dft method (wb97x/6-31g*// m062x/6-31g*/smd) from which the ai models try to learn. we find that the substitution effect on tautomeric equilibrium is well predicted by moltaut, which is helpful in computer-aided ligand design. the source code of moltaut is freely available to researchers and can be accessed at https://github.com/xundrug/moltaut. to facilitate the usage of moltaut by medicinal chemists, we made a free web server, which is available at http://moltaut.xundrug.cn. moltaut is a handy tool for investigating the tautomerization issue in drug discovery.",AB_0184
"road extraction from remote sensing imagery is a popular and frontier research focus, since road information plays an essential role in application fields, such as urban management, map updating and traffic planning. deep learning based methods have shown their dominance on road extraction from remote sensing imagery. however, the performance of the existing road extraction methods relies heavily on a large amount of high -quality annotated training data, which is usually hard to obtain in practice. current semi-supervised road extraction models can effectively reduce the dependency on the labeled data, nevertheless they cannot fully utilize the latent information of low-confidence pixels in pseudo-labels effectively. these pixels are usually a border between road and non-road area and of importance for the prediction accuracy of road extraction models. in order to address these issues, we proposed a novel semi-supervised road extraction network, named semiroadexnet. semiroadexnet is based on a generative adversarial network (gan), containing one generator with two discriminators. firstly, both labeled and unlabeled images are put into the generator network for road extraction, and the outputs of the generator not only include road segmentation results but also the corresponding entropy maps. the entropy maps represent the confidence of prediction (road or non-road) for each pixel. then, the two discriminators enforce the feature distributions keeping the consistency of road prediction maps and entropy maps between the labeled and unlabeled data. during the adversarial training, the generator is continuously regularized by exploiting the potential information from unlabeled data, thus the generalization capacity of the proposed model can be improved effectively. compared to several state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods, the proposed semiroadexnet achieves 0.96-5.38% iou improvements on deepglobe road extraction, massachusetts roads and chn6-cug datasets respectively. the source code of d semiroadexnet is freely available at https://github.com/hchen118/semiroadexnet.",AB_0184

"when solving global optimization problems by metaheuristic algorithms (mas), an important issue is how to keep a balance between convergence and diversity. this article develops an enhanced slime mould algorithm called agsma to address the above issue. in agsma, the entire population is divided into two subpopulations. the size of each subpopulation is dynamically tuned based on the average fitness value. afterward, different from the search equation in conventional sma, a new search mechanism is raised to discover more promising regions. furthermore, an efficient learning operator is devised to discourage premature convergence. the com-parison of the raised agsma on several benchmark functions and practical engineering problems with selected state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that the developed algorithm performs effectively and competitively. the source code of agsma is publicly available at https://github.com/denglingyun123/enhanced-slime-mould-algorithm.",AB_0184
"with the rise of geoai research, streetscape imagery has received extensive attention due to its comprehensive coverage, abundant information, and accessibility. however, obtaining a holistic spatial-temporal scene representation is difficult because places are often composed of multiple images from different angles, times and locations. this problem also exists in other types of geo-tagged imagery. to solve it, we propose a purely visual, robust, and reliable method for urban function identification at the street scale. we introduce a method based on a two-layer spatially dependent graph neural network structure, which handles sequential street view imagery as input (typically available in services such as google street view, baidu maps, and mapillary), with full consideration of the spatial dependencies among road networks. in this paper, we construct an urban topological map network using openstreetmap data in wuhan, china, and compute a semantic representation of the scene as a whole at the street scale using a large-scale pre-trained model. we construct the graph network with streets as nodes based on 28,693 mapping relationships constructed from 75,628 street view images and 5,458 streets. only 5.3% of the node labels were required to obtain 10 categories of functions for all nodes in the study area. the results demonstrate that by using appropriate spatial weights, street encoder, and graph structure, our novel method achieves high accuracy of p@1 46.2%, p@3 73.0%, p@5 82.4%, and p@10 89.9%, fully demonstrating the effectiveness of the introduced approach. we also use the model to sense urban spatial-temporal renewal by computing time series street images. the model is also applicable to the prediction of other attributes, where only a small number of labels are required to obtain valid and reliable scene perception results. the example data and code is shared at: https://github.com/yemanzhongting/knowledge-and-topology.",AB_0184
"to guarantee vessel traffic safety in inland waterways, the automatic identification system (ais) and shore-based cameras have been widely adopted to monitor moving vessels. the ais data could provide the unique maritime mobile service identity (mmsi), position coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude), course over ground, and speed over ground for the vessels of interest. in contrast, the cameras could directly display the visual appearance of vessels but fail to accurately grasp the vessels' identity information and motion parameters. in this paper, we propose to improve the maritime traffic surveillance in inland waterways using the robust fusion of ais and visual data. it is able to obtain more accurate vessel tracking results and kinematic characteristics. in particular, to robustly track the visual vessels under complex scenarios, we first propose an anti-occlusion vessel tracking method based on the simple online and real-time tracking with a deep association metric (deepsort) method. we then preprocess and predict the vessel positions to obtain synchronous ais and visual data. before the implementation of ais and visual data fusion, the ais position coordinates in the geodetic coordinate system will be projected into the image coordinate system via the coordinate transformation. a multi-feature similarity measurement-based hungarian algorithm is finally proposed to robustly and accurately fuse the ais and visual data in the image coordinate system. for the sake of repeating fusion experiments, we have also presented a new multi-sensor dataset containing ais data and shore-based camera imagery. the quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our fusion method is capable of improving the maritime traffic surveillance in inland waterways. it can overcome the vessel occlusion problem and fully utilizes the advantages of multi-source data to promote the maritime surveillance, resulting in enhanced vessel traffic safety and efficiency. in this work, the presented multi-sensor dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/qujx/ais-visual-fusion.",AB_0184
"background: the effects of angioplasty on intracranial atherosclerotic disease (icad)-related acute large-vessel occlusion stroke (lvos) are unknown. we analyzed the efficacy and safety of angioplasty or stenting for icad-related lvos and the optimal treatment duration. methods: patients with icad-related lvos from a prospective cohort of the endovascular treatment key technique and emergency work flow improvement of acute ischemia stroke registry were classified as follows: the early intraprocedural angioplasty and/or stenting (eas) group was defined as the strategy using angioplasty or stenting without mechanical thrombectomy (mt) or one attempt of mt; the non-angioplasty and/or stenting (nas) group, mt procedure without any angioplasty; and the late intraprocedural angioplasty and/or stenting (las) group, using same angioplasty techniques following two or more passes of mt. the primary endpoint was the modified rankin scale (mrs) score at 90 days. other efficacy outcomes included mrs scores 0-1, mrs 0-2, and successful recanalization. death within 90 days, and symptomatic ich were safety endpoints. we use propensity score method to diminish the effect of treatment-selection bias. the odds ratio of recanalization rate and mrs score among eas, nas, and las groups were examined by unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis among unweighted samples and inverse probability of treatment weighting (iptw) samples. results: we divided 475 cases into three groups. functional outcomes at 90 days were better in the eas group than in the nas and las groups. the proportion of mrs 0-1, mrs 0-2, and successful recanalization cases were the highest in the eas group. however, after iptw, mortality rate among the three groups were similar (eas vs. nas vs. las: 19.0 vs. 18.1 vs. 18.7%, p = 0.98) as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 h however, mortality rate and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage among the three groups were similar. logistic regression analysis in unweighted samples and iptw samples both showed that eas group had better outcomes. iptw-adjusted logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the eas group had better outcomes (mrs 0-1) than the nas group (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.34-0.88, p = 0.01) and las (aor, 0.39; 95% ci: 0.22-0.68, p = 0.001). conclusions: angioplasty and/or stenting should be performed at an early stage for icad-related acute lvos. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03370939.",AB_0184
"a detailed representation of the surrounding road scene is crucial for an autonomous driving system. yellow the camera-based bird's eye view map has been a popular solution to present the surrounding information, due to its low cost and rich spatial context information. most of the existing methods predict the bev map based on the depth-estimation or the trivial homography method, which may cause the error propagation and the absence of content. to overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel end-to-end framework that employs the front monocular image to predict the road layout and vehicle occupancy. in particular, to capture the long-range feature, we redesign a cnn encoder with a large kernel size to extract the image features. for reducing the big difference between the front image features and the top-down features, we propose a novel spatial-channel projection module to convert the front map into the top-down space. additionally, concerning the correlation between front view and top-down view, we propose the dual cross-view transformer module to refine the top-down view feature maps and strengthen the transformation. extensive evaluations on the kitti and argoverse datasets present that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art results for both datasets. furthermore, the proposed model runs in 37 fps on a single gpu, demonstrating the generation of a real-time bev map. the code will be published at https://github.com/raozhongyu/bev_lka.",AB_0184
"purpose: cerebrovascular segmentation from time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (tof-mra) is important but challenging for the simulation and measurement of cerebrovascular diseases. recently, deep learning has promoted the rapid development of cerebrovascular segmentation. however, model op-timization relies on voxel or regional punishment and lacks global awareness and interpretation from the texture and edge. to overcome the limitations of the existing methods, we propose a new cerebrovascular segmentation method to obtain more refined structures. methods: in this paper, we propose a new adversarial model that achieves segmentation using segmenta-tion model and filters the results using discriminator. considering the sample imbalance in cerebrovascu-lar imaging, we separated the tof-mra images and utilized high-and low-frequency images to enhance the texture and edge representation. the encoder weight sharing from the segmentation model not only saves the model parameters, but also strengthens the integration and separation correlation. diversified discrimination enhances the robustness and regularization of the model. results: the adversarial model was tested using two cerebrovascular datasets. it scored 82.26% and 73.38%, respectively, ranking first on both datasets. the results show that our method not only outper-forms the recent cerebrovascular segmentation model, but also surpasses the common adversarial mod-els. conclusion: our adversarial model focuses on improving the extraction ability of the model on texture and edge, thereby achieving awareness of the global cerebrovascular topology. therefore, we obtained an accurate and robust cerebrovascular segmentation. this framework has potential applications in many imaging fields, particularly in the application of sample imbalance. our code is available at the website https://github.com/montaellis/isa-model .(c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v.",AB_0184
"accurate transportation mode identification is essential for traffic management and travel planning. the rapid development of gps-enabled devices has made it both popular and cost-effective to obtain travel modes from massive gps trajectory datasets. however, since different transportation modes exhibit significantly different spatial characteristics, varied scale representation can be used to efficiently capture these differences, but existing research have failed to fully exploit this point.to address these issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework named multi-attribute scale-object-based multi-stage fusion network (maso-msf). a maso structure is constructed to represent the local motion states and spatial characteristics of one gps trajectory segment at different spatial scales. subsequently, a multi-stage fusion model (msf) is designed to perform accurate transportation mode identification in an end-to-end manner. in this model, an attribute channel fusion module is built to fuse local motion states and capture the spatial dependencies. a scale feature fusion module is then established to selectively aggregate features from different spatial scales. finally, msf deploys an object decision fusion module to generate the final identification result from different probabilities of multiple objects in a trajectory segment.to evaluate the performance of the proposed maso-msf model, a series of experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset. the experimental results verify the effectiveness of maso in characterizing a trajectory segment from three perspectives (i.e., attribute, scale, and object) and demonstrate that maso-msf can achieve the state-of-the-art identification performance. in addition, the source code of maso-msf is now available at github (https://github. com/myl23/maso-msf).",AB_0184
