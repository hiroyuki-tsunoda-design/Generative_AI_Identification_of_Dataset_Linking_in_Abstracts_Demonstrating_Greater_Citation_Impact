"complex (mhc) genes are responsible for the binding and cell surface presentation of pathogen or cancer specific t-cell epitopes. this process is fundamental for eliciting t-cell recognition of infected or malignant cells. epitopes displayed on mhc molecules further provide therapeutic targets for personalized cancer vaccines or adoptive t-cell therapy. to help visualizing, analyzing and comparing the different binding specificities of mhc molecules, we developed the mhc motif atlas (http://mhcmotifatlas. org/). this database contains information about thousands of class i and class ii mhc molecules, including binding motifs, peptide length distributions, motifs of phosphorylated ligands, multiple specificities or links to x-ray crystallography structures. the database further enables users to download curated datasets of mhc ligands. by combining intuitive visualization of the main binding properties of mhc molecules together with access to more than a million ligands, the mhc motif atlas provides a central resource to analyze and interpret the binding specificities of mhc molecules.",AB_0009
"despite recent progress of automatic medical image segmentation techniques, fully automatic results usually fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, thus typically require further refinement. to this end, we propose a novel volumetric memory network, dubbed as vmn, to enable segmentation of 3d medical images in an interactive manner. provided by user hints on an arbitrary slice, a 2d interaction network is firstly employed to produce an initial 2d segmentation for the chosen slice. then, the vmn propagates the initial segmentation mask bidirectionally to all slices of the entire volume. subsequent refinement based on additional user guidance on other slices can be incorporated in the same manner. to facilitate smooth human-in-the-loop segmentation, a quality assessment module is introduced to suggest the next slice for interaction based on the segmentation quality of each slice produced in the previous round. our vmn demonstrates two distinctive features: first, the memory-augmented network design offers our model the ability to quickly encode past segmentation information, which will be retrieved later for the segmentation of other slices; second, the quality assessment module enables the model to directly estimate the quality of each segmentation prediction, which allows for an active learning paradigm where users preferentially label the lowest-quality slice for multi-round refinement. the proposed network leads to a robust interactive segmentation engine, which can generalize well to various types of user annotations (e.g., scribble, bounding box, extreme clicking). extensive experiments have been conducted on three public medical image segmentation datasets (i.e., msd, kits19, cvc-clinicdb), and the results clearly confirm the superiority of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation models. the code is made publicly available at https://github.com/0liliulei/mem3d.",AB_0009
"recent advances in cryo-em led to a surge of ribosome structures deposited over the past years, including structures from different species, conformational states, or bound with different ligands. yet, multiple conflicts of nomenclature make the identification and comparison of structures and ortholog components challenging. we present riboxyz (available at https://ribosome.xyz ), a database that provides organized access to ribosome structures, with several tools for visualisation and study. the database is up-to-date with the protein data bank (pdb) but provides a standardized nomenclature that allows for searching and comparing ribosomal components (proteins, rna, ligands) across all the available structures. in addition to structured and simplified access to the data, the application has several specialized visualization tools, including the identification and prediction of ligand binding sites, and 3d superimposition of ribosomal components. overall, riboxyz provides a useful toolkit that complements the pdb database, by implementing the current conventions and providing a set of auxiliary tools that have been developed explicitly for analyzing ribosome structures. this toolkit can be easily accessed by both experts and non-experts in structural biology so that they can search, visualize and compare structures, with various potential applications in molecular biology, evolution, and biochemistry.",AB_0009
"the chemical functional ontology (chemfont), located at https://www.chemfont.ca, is a hierarchical, owl-compatible ontology describing the functions and actions of >341 000 biologically important chemicals. these include primary metabolites, secondary metabolites, natural products, food chemicals, synthetic food additives, drugs, herbicides, pesticides and environmental chemicals. chemfont is a fair-compliant resource intended to bring the same rigor, standardization and formal structure to the terms and terminology used in biochemistry, food chemistry and environmental chemistry as the gene ontology (go) has brought to molecular biology. chemfont is available as both a freely accessible, web-enabled database and a downloadable web ontology language (owl) file. users may download and deploy chemfont within their own chemical databases or integrate chemfont into their own analytical software to generate machine readable relationships that can be used to make new inferences, enrich their omics data sets or make new, non-obvious connections between chemicals and their direct or indirect effects. the web version of the chemfont database has been designed to be easy to search, browse and navigate. currently chemfont contains data on 341 627 chemicals, including 515 332 terms or definitions. the functional hierarchy for chemfont consists of four functional 'aspects', 12 functional supercategories and a total of 173 705 functional terms. in addition, each of the chemicals are classified into 4825 structure-based chemical classes. chemfont currently contains 3.9 million protein-chemical relationships and similar to 10.3 million chemical-functional relationships. the long-term goal for chemfont is for it to be adopted by databases and software tools used by the general chemistry community as well as the metabolomics, exposomics, metagenomics, genomics and proteomics communities.",AB_0009
"this paper describes and provides z1+, the successor of the z- and z1-codes for topological analyses of mono- and polydisperse entangled linear polymeric systems, in the presence or absence of confining surfaces or nano-inclusions. in contrast to its predecessors, z1+ makes use of adaptive neighbor lists, and keeps the number of temporary nodes relatively large, yielding improved performance for large system sizes. z1+ also includes several features its predecessors lacked, including several that are advantageous for analyses of semi-crystalline systems, brushes, nano-composites, and flowing liquids. it offers a graphical user interface that can be used to run z1+ and visualize the results, and a ppa+ option that allows z1+ to perform a primitive path analysis more efficiently than the standard procedure (ppaoption). in addition to describing z1+'s and ppa+'s implementation and computational performance in detail, we use it to show that it yields entanglement lengths that agree quantitatively with both a recently proposed unified analytic theory for flexible and semiflexible polymer-melt entanglement and with the available experimental data for these systems. finally we show that the associated theoretical expressions, which express reduced entanglement-related quantities in terms of the scaled kuhn segment density lambda, need not describe results for model polymer solutions of different chemistries, i.e. different angular and dihedral interactions but the same lambda. program summary program title: z1+ cpc library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/m425t6xtwr.1 licensing provisions: apache-2.0 programming language: fortran 90, perl (standalone batch version) or java (interactive online version) external requirements: perl 5+(standalone batch version), jre 1.8.0+(interactive online version) nature of problem: starting from a multiple-chain configuration that consists of the coordinates of particles forming linear chains, as well as the dimensions of the rectangular or monoclinic (periodic or closed) cell containing the particles, the problem is to find the shortest multiple disconnected path obtained from the starting configuration upon (i) fixing chain ends at their original positions, (ii) disallowing bond crossings, and (iii) monotonically decreasing the path length. solution method: we use local geometric operations that fulfill the constraints (i)-(iii) and apply them as long as the path is still shrinking. this ultimately leads to disconnected polygons, i.e., paths characterized by nodes interconnected by straight lines. each node has a corresponding `entangled' node responsible for its existence. these pairs as well as the full configuration of the shortest path is reported.

"transcriptome-wide association studies (twass), as a practical and prevalent approach for detecting the associations between genetically regulated genes and traits, are now leading to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of genetic variants in regulating various diseases and traits. despite the ever-increasing twas outputs, there is still a lack of databases curating massive public twas information and knowledge. to fill this gap, here we present twas atlas (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/twas/), an integrated knowledgebase of twas findings manually curated from extensive literature. in the current implementation, twas atlas collects 401,266 high-quality human gene-trait associations from 200 publications, covering 22,247 genes and 257 traits across 135 tissue types. in particular, an interactive knowledge graph of the collected gene-trait associations is constructed together with single nucleotide polymorphism (snp)-gene associations to build up comprehensive regulatory networks at multi-omics levels. in addition, twas atlas, as a user-friendly web interface, efficiently enables users to browse, search and download all association information, relevant research metadata and annotation information of interest. taken together, twas atlas is of great value for promoting the utility and availability of twas results in explaining the complex genetic basis as well as providing new insights for human health and disease research.",AB_0009
"the covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has become a major global threat to human health and well-being. thus, the development of computer-aided detection (cad) systems that are capable of accurately distinguishing covid-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (ct) and x-ray data is of immediate priority. such automatic systems are usually based on traditional machine learning or deep learning methods. differently from most of the existing studies, which used either ct scan or x-ray images in covid-19-case classification, we present a new, simple but efficient deep learning feature fusion model, called uncertaintyfusenet, which is able to classify accurately large datasets of both of these types of images. we argue that the uncertainty of the model's predictions should be taken into account in the learning process, even though most of the existing studies have overlooked it. we quantify the prediction uncertainty in our feature fusion model using effective ensemble monte carlo dropout (emcd) technique. a comprehensive simulation study has been conducted to compare the results of our new model to the existing approaches, evaluating the performance of competing models in terms of precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy and roc curves. the obtained results prove the efficiency of our model which provided the prediction accuracy of 99.08% and 96.35% for the considered ct scan and x-ray datasets, respectively. moreover, our uncertaintyfusenet model was generally robust to noise and performed well with previously unseen data. the source code of our implementation is freely available at: https://github.com/moloud1987/uncertaintyfusenet-for-covid-19-classification.",AB_0009
"anticosti island, eastern canada, records an exceptionally thick and well-exposed ordovician/silurian boundary section that hosts a series of diverse marine invertebrate faunas across the late ordovician mass extinction. however, the base of the terminal ordovician stage, the hirnantian, has been difficult to identify on anticosti due to the lack of a traditional hirnantia fauna within the upper ordovician ellis bay formation. previously, the eponymous taxon of the hirnantia fauna, and type species of the genus hirnantia, h. sagittifera (m'coy, 1851) has been reported only from the uppermost ellis bay formation, leading to uncertainty as to the age of the lower ellis bay formation. here we report hirnantia notiskuani n. sp. from the lowermost ellis bay formation. this new species is similar to the type species, h. sagittifera, but is distinguished by its strongly dorsibiconvex shell in mature forms and variously developed uniplicate anterior commissure. occurrences of these two similar species of hirnantia, h. notiskuani and h. sagittifera, within the lower and uppermost ellis bay formation, respectively, indicate a hirnantian age for the entire ellis bay formation, a finding that is supported by recent palynological and chemostratigraphic studies. brachiopod assemblages within the ellis bay formation therefore are best characterized as a unique and diverse hirnantia fauna, consisting of genera from both the typical hirnantia fauna and the epeiric seas of laurentia. uuid: http://zoobank.org/1c1dff6a-ee38-4cd3-b8bd-3d803a2774ef",AB_0009
"purpose - to respond to the covid-19 infodemic and combat fraud and misinformation about the virus, social media platforms coordinated with government healthcare agencies around the world to elevate authoritative content about the novel coronavirus. these public health authorities included national and global public health organisations, such as the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the world health organisation (who). in this article, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy by asking two key questions: (1) did people engage with authoritative health content on social media? (2) was this content trusted? design/methodology/approach - the authors explore these issues by drawing on data from a global online questionnaire on public trust in experts (n = 429) conducted during the initial phase of the pandemic in may 2020, a crucial period when reliable information was urgently required to influence behaviour and minimise harm. findings - the authors found that while the majority of those surveyed noticed authoritative health content online, there remained significant issues in terms of internet users trusting the information shared by government healthcare agencies and public health authorities online. originality/value - in what follows, the authors examine the role of trust in implementing this novel public health strategy and assess the capacity for such policies to reduce individual and social harm. peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/oir-12-2021-0655",AB_0009
"this paper introduces eilmer, a general-purpose open-source compressible flow solver developed at the university of queensland, designed to support research calculations in hypersonics and high-speed aerothermodynamics. eilmer has a broad userbase in several university research groups and a wide range of capabilities, which are documented on the project's website, in the accompanying reference manuals, and in an extensive catalogue of example simulations. the first part of this paper describes the formulation of the code: the equations, physical models, and numerical methods that are used in a basic fluid dynamics simulation, as well as a handful of optional multi-physics models that are commonly added on to do calculations of hypersonic flow. the second section describes the processes used to develop and maintain the code, documenting our adherence to good programming practice and endorsing certain techniques that seem to be particularly helpful for scientific codes. the final section describes a half-dozen example simulations that span the range of eilmer's capabilities, each consisting of some sample results and a short explanation of the problem being solved, which together will hopefully assist new users in beginning to use eilmer in their own research projects.program summaryprogram title: eilmerpc library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/gy2ds2fyxm.1developer's repository link: https://github.com/gdtk-uq/gdtkcode ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/7226427 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: d, lua supplementary material: https://gdtk.uqcloud.netnature of problem: eilmer solves the compressible navier-stokes equations with a particular emphasis on flows at hypersonic speeds. the code includes modelling for high-temperature gas effects such as chemical and vibrational nonequilibrium. eilmer can be used for the simulation for unsteady and steady flows.solution method: the code is implemented in d [1] and built on a finite-volume formulation that is capable of solving the navier-stokes equations in 2d and 3d computational domains, discretised with structured or unstructured grids. grids may be generated using a built-in parametric scripting tool or imported from commercial gridding software. the inviscid fluxes are computed using the reconstruction -evolution approach. in structured-grid mode, reconstruction stencils up to fourth-order spatial accuracy are available. in unstructured-grid mode, least-squares reconstruction provides second-order spatial accuracy. a variety of flux calculators are available in the code. viscous fluxes are computed with compact stencils with second-order spatial accuracy. for unsteady flows, explicit time-stepping with low-order rk-family schemes are available, along with a point-implicit backward-euler update scheme for stiff systems of equations. for steady flows, convergence can be greatly accelerated using a jacobian-free newton-krylov update scheme, which seeks a global minimum in the residuals using a series of large pseudo-timesteps. domain decomposition is used for parallel execution using both shared memory and distributed memory programming techniques.additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: eilmer provides a programmable interface for pre-processing, post-processing and user run-time customisations. the programmable interfaceis enabled using a built-in embedded interpreter for the lua programming language [2]. run-time customisations include used-defined boundary conditions, source terms and grid motion. references[1] d programming language web page: https://dlang .org/.[2] lua programming language web page: https://www.lua .org/.
