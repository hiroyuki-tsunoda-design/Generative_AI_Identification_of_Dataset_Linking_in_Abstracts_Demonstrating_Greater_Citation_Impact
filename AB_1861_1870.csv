"background: this study aims to explore the active components of panax ginseng (pg)-schisandrae chinensis fructus (sc) and reveal the mechanism of improving neurodegenerative diseases (ndd) based on network pharmacology and molecular docking. methods: detailed information about the pg-sc herbal pair was obtained from traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology (tcmsp) and screened using ob (oral bioavailability) >= 30% and dl (drug-likeness) >= 0.18 as criteria. genes were collected using omim, genecards, and pharmgkb (pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics knowledge base) methods. the string database was utilized to obtain protein-protein interaction (ppi) data. the core targets were entered into the data source of the efp (electronic fluorescent pictograph) browser (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp_human/) for organ localization and created a target-organ localization map. we constructed and analyzed the network using cytoscape 3.9.1 (national institute of general medical sciences, bethesda, md, usa). encyclopedia of genomes (kegg) pathway-enriched targets were used for analysis. after identifying the core network, a protein-protein interaction (ppi) network of pg-sc targets was constructed. autodock vina and pymol software were used to validate the results for its active ingredients and key targets. results: there were 14 active ingredients in ginseng and 8 in schisandra, with 8320 corresponding protein targets and 80 common targets with neurodegenerative diseases (ndd), of which 21 highly abundant targets were highly expressed in the brain. six core targets were identified, including akt1 (rac-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase), casp3 (caspase 3), mapk8 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 8), 1l1b (interleukin 1 beta), jun (jun proto-oncogene, ap-1 transcription factor subunit), and ptgs2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2). the 142 kegg signaling pathways were enriched, including the pathways of neurodegeneration-multiple diseases and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. molecular docking confirmed that the core targets (akt1, casp3, mapk8, 1l1b, jun, ptgs2) could bind to the active compounds (kaempferol, beta_sitosterol, conclusions: based on network pharmacology and molecular docking, the pg-sc herbal pair could act on ndd through neuronal programmed cell death targets and related signaling pathways. our findings provide the basis for further research using herbs to treat ndd and develop anti-ndd drugs.",AB_0187
"domain boundary prediction is one of the most important problems in the study of protein structure and function, especially for large proteins. at present, most domain boundary prediction methods have low accuracy and limitations in dealing with multi-domain proteins. in this study, we develop a sequence-based protein domain boundary prediction, named dombpred. in dombpred, the input sequence is first classified as either a single-domain protein or a multi-domain protein through a designed effective sequence metric based on a constructed single-domain sequence library. for the multi-domain protein, a domain-residue clustering algorithm inspired by ising model is proposed to cluster the spatially close residues according inter-residue distance. the unclassified residues and the residues at the edge of the cluster are then tuned by the secondary structure to form potential cut points. finally, a domain boundary scoring function is proposed to recursively evaluate the potential cut points to generate the domain boundary. dombpred is tested on a large-scale test set of fupred comprising 2549 proteins. experimental results show that dombpred better performs than the state-of-the-art methods in classifying whether protein sequences are composed by single or multiple domains, and the matthew's correlation coefficient is 0.882. moreover, on 849 multi-domain proteins, the domain boundary distance and normalised domain overlap scores of dombpred are 0.523 and 0.824, respectively, which are 5.0% and 4.2% higher than those of the best comparison method, respectively. comparison with other methods on the given test set shows that dombpred outperforms most state-of-the-art sequence-based methods and even achieves better results than the top-level template-based method. the executable program is freely available at https://github.com/iobio-zjut/dombpred and the online server at http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/dombpred/.",AB_0187
"identifying interactions between compounds and proteins is an essential task in drug discovery. to recommend compounds as new drug candidates, applying the computational approaches has a lower cost than conducting the wet-lab experiments. machine learning-based methods, especially deep learning-based methods, have advantages in learning complex feature interactions between compounds and proteins. however, deep learning models will over-generalize and lead to the problem of predicting less relevant compound-protein pairs when the compound-protein feature interactions are high-dimensional sparse. this problem can be overcome by learning both low-order and high-order feature interactions. in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model with factorization machines and graph neural network called fmgnn to extract the low-order and high-order features, respectively. then, we design a compound-protein interactions (cpis) prediction method with pharmacophore features of compound and physicochemical properties of amino acids. the pharmacophore features can ensure that the prediction results much more fit the expectation of biological experiment and the physicochemical properties of amino acids are loaded into the embedding layer to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of protein feature learning. the experimental results on several datasets, especially on an imbalanced large-scale dataset, showed that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods for cpi prediction. the western blot experiment results on wogonin and its candidate target proteins also showed that our proposed method is effective and accurate for finding target proteins. the computer program of implementing the model fmgnn is available at https://github.com/tcygxu2021/fmgnn.",AB_0187
"accumulated studies discovered that various microbes in human bodies were closely related to complex human diseases and could provide new insight into drug development. multiple computational methods were constructed to predict microbes that were potentially associated with diseases. however, most previous methods were based on single characteristics of microbes or diseases, that lacked important biological information related to microorganisms or diseases. therefore, we constructed a knowledge graph centered on microorganisms and diseases from several existed databases to provide knowledgeable information for microbes and diseases. then, we adopted a graph neural network method to learn representations of microbes and diseases from the constructed knowledge graph. after that, we introduced the gaussian kernel similarity features of microbes and diseases to generate final representations of microbes and diseases. at last, we proposed a score function on final representations of microbes and diseases to predict scores of microbe-disease associations. comprehensive experiments on the human microbe-disease association database (hmdad) dataset had demonstrated that our approach outperformed baseline methods. furthermore, we implemented case studies on two important diseases (asthma and inflammatory bowel disease), the result demonstrated that our proposed model was effective in revealing the relationship between diseases and microbes. the source code of our model and the data were available on https://github.com/changzhijiang/kgnmda_master.",AB_0187
"padding is employed vastly in convolutional neural networks (cnns) to maintain the output size. in current padding schemes, the input feature maps are padded using quite simple strategies, e.g., constant zero values in zero padding, which is the most common padding choice. in this work, we propose to use learning-based paradigms to calculate the padding data from the connectivity of the input images on the data borders. two different modules, i.e., learning-based padding by convolution (lpc) and learning-based padding by attention (lpa), are designed to obtain the padding data from the interdependencies of the image border data along the channel and spatial dimensions, respectively. the designed lpc or lpa is formulated as a generic, plug-and -play unit, which can be a direct replacement for the conventional padding technique. extensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks show that the proposed padding schemes can consistently obtain higher accuracy than standard padding schemes, in various deep network backbones. the codes and trained modules are available at https://github.com/icsresearch/lp.",AB_0187
"sequential recommendation models a user's historical sequence to predict future items. existing studies utilize deep learning methods and contrastive learning for data augmentation to alleviate data sparsity. however, these existing methods cannot learn accurate high-quality item representations while augmenting data. in addition, they usually ignore data noise and user cold-start issues. to solve the above issues, we investigate the possibility of generative adversarial network (gan) with contrastive learning for sequential recommendation to balance data sparsity and noise. specifically, we propose a new framework, enhanced contrastive learning with generative adversarial network for sequential recommendation (ecgan-rec), which models the training process as a gan and recommendation task as the main task of the discriminator. we design a sequence augmentation module and a contrastive gan module to implement both data-level and model-level augmentations. in addition, the contrastive gan learns more accurate high-quality item representations to alleviate data noise after data augmentation. furthermore, we propose an enhanced transformer recommender based on gan to optimize the performance of the model. experimental results on three open datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and the ability of the model to balance data noise and data sparsity. specifically, the improvement of ecgan-rec in two evaluation metrics (hr@n and ndcg@n) compared to the state-of-the-art model performance on the beauty, sports and yelp datasets are 34.95%, 36.68%, and 13.66%, respectively. our implemented model is available via https://github.com/nishawn/ecganrec-master.",AB_0187
"multimodal deep learning models have been applied for disease prediction tasks, but difficulties exist in training due to the conflict between sub-models and fusion modules. to alleviate this issue, we propose a framework for decoupling feature alignment and fusion (deaf), which separates the multimodal model training into two stages. in the first stage, unsupervised representation learning is conducted, and the modality adaptation (ma) module is used to align the features from various modalities. in the second stage, the self-attention fusion (saf) module combines the medical image features and clinical data using supervised learning. moreover, we apply the deaf framework to predict the postoperative efficacy of crs for colorectal cancer and whether the mci patients change to alzheimer's disease. the deaf framework achieves a significant improvement in comparison to the previous methods. furthermore, extensive ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of our framework. in conclusion, our framework enhances the interaction between the local medical image features and clinical data, and derive more discriminative multimodal features for disease prediction. the framework implementation is available at https://github.com/cchencan/deaf.",AB_0187
"study objectives: the aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of sleep bruxism (sb) and to investigate the relationships between sb episodes, arousals, and respiratory events in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (osa). methods: this prospective study included 914 adults with osa (305 females, 609 males; age = 53 years [interquartile range = 17]; apnea-hypopnea index = 13.9 events/h [interquartile range = 21]). the diagnosis of sb was made when the rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (rmma) index was at least 2 episodes/h of sleep based on a full polysomnographic recording. binary logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for sb. network analysis was performed to determine the relations between rmma, respiratory event, sleep arousal, and other factors. further, the percentage of rmma time-related to arousal was calculated. results: the prevalence of sb in adults with osa was 49.7%. male sex, lower body mass index, and higher percentage of n1 sleep increased the odds of having sb (odds ratios =1.425, 0.951, and 1.032, respectively; all p < .05). network analysis showed that there were no direct associations between rmma and apnea-hypopnea index, nor between rmma and arousal, although 85.7% of rmma was time-related to arousals. conclusions: nearly half of adults with osa have comorbid sb. male sex, lower body mass index, and a higher percentage of light sleep increase the risk of having sb. although rmmas do not directly correlate with respiratory events and arousals, most rmmas are time-related to arousals in adults with osa. clinical trial registration: registry: netherlands trial register; name: a large sample polysomnographic study on sleep bruxism; url: https://trialsearch. who.int/trial2.aspx?trialid=nl8516; identifier: nl8516.",AB_0187
"enhancers are crucial for precise regulation of gene expression, while enhancer identification and strength prediction are challenging because of their free distribution and tremendous number of similar fractions in the genome. although several bioinformatics tools have been developed, shortfalls in these models remain, and their performances need further improvement. in the present study, a two-layer predictor called enhancer-frl was proposed for identifying enhancers (enhancers or nonenhancers) and their activities (strong and weak). more specifically, to build an efficient model, the feature representation learning scheme was applied to generate a 50d probabilistic vector based on 10 feature encodings and five machine learning algorithms. subsequently, the multiview probabilistic features were integrated to construct the final prediction model. compared with the single feature-based model, enhancer-frl showed significant performance improvement and model robustness. performance assessment on the independent test dataset indicated that the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art available toolkits. the webserver enhancer-frl is freely accessible at http://lab.malab.cn/-wangchao/softwares/enhancer-frl/, the code and datasets can be downloaded at the webserver page or at the github https://github.com/wangchao-malab/enhancer-frl/.",AB_0187
"objective the hemodynamics of a brain arteriovenous malformation (avm) nidus may be closely related to clinical presentation. the authors of this study aimed to explore the hemorrhagic quantitative hemodynamic indicators of the nidus through quantitative digital subtraction angiography (qdsa). methods the quantitative hemodynamic parameters were generated from qdsa. three data sets were used to ex-plore independent quantitative hemodynamic indicators associated with avm rupture. the training data set was exploited to discover independent quantitative hemodynamic indicators of avm rupture by performing univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. the authors plotted receiver operating characteristic curves to validate the diagnostic per-formance of the hemorrhagic hemodynamic indicators using the training and two external validation data sets. kaplan -meier survival analysis was adopted to verify the predictive power of these risk indicators of future hemorrhage in the external prospective validation data set.results a total of 151 patients were included in this study, 91 in the training set and 30 in each of the two validation sets. a higher stasis index and slower transnidal relative velocity (trv) of the nidus were significantly correlated with avm rupture. the areas under the curve (aucs) of the stasis index (nidus) were 0.765 and 0.815 and those of the trv (nidus) were 0.735 and 0.796, respectively, in the training and retrospective external validation sets. kaplan-meier surviv-al analysis confirmed the validity of the stasis index and trv in predicting future rupture risk in the prospective validation data set (p = 0.008 and 0.041, respectively, log-rank test).conclusions a higher stasis index (nidus) and slower trv (nidus) in qdsa were associated with avm rupture and were effective indicators of future hemorrhage, suggesting that the core mechanisms underlying avm rupture could be intravascular blood stasis and occlusive hyperemia of the nidus. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.6.jns212818",AB_0187
