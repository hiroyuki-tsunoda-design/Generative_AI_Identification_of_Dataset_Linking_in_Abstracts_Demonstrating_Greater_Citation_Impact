"backgroundthe precise characterization of individual tumors and immune microenvironments using transcriptome sequencing has provided a great opportunity for successful personalized cancer treatment. however, the cancer treatment response is often characterized by in vitro assays or bulk transcriptomes that neglect the heterogeneity of malignant tumors in vivo and the immune microenvironment, motivating the need to use single-cell transcriptomes for personalized cancer treatment.methodshere, we present combosc, a computational proof-of-concept study to explore the feasibility of personalized cancer combination therapy optimization using single-cell transcriptomes. combosc provides a workable solution to stratify individual patient samples based on quantitative evaluation of their personalized immune microenvironment with single-cell rna sequencing and maximize the translational potential of in vitro cellular response to unify the identification of synergistic drug/small molecule combinations or small molecules that can be paired with immune checkpoint inhibitors to boost immunotherapy from a large collection of small molecules and drugs, and finally prioritize them for personalized clinical use based on bipartition graph optimization.resultswe apply combosc to publicly available 119 single-cell transcriptome data from a comprehensive set of 119 tumor samples from 15 cancer types and validate the predicted drug combination with literature evidence, mining clinical trial data, perturbation of patient-derived cell line data, and finally in-vivo samples.conclusionsoverall, combosc provides a feasible and one-stop computational prototype and a proof-of-concept study to predict potential drug combinations for further experimental validation and clinical usage using the single-cell transcriptome, which will facilitate and accelerate personalized tumor treatment by reducing screening time from a large drug combination space and saving valuable treatment time for individual patients. a user-friendly web server of combosc for both clinical and research users is available at www.combosc.top. the source code is also available on github at https://github.com/bm2-lab/combosc.",AB_0389
"to achieve the enormous potential of gene-editing technology in clinical therapies, one needs to evaluate both the on-target efficiency and unintended editing consequences comprehensively. however, there is a lack of a pipelined, large-scale, and economical workflow for detecting genome editing outcomes, in particular insertion or deletion of a large fragment. here, we describe an approach for efficient and accurate detection of multiple genetic changes after crispr/cas9 editing by pooled nanopore sequencing of barcoded long-range pcr products. recognizing the high error rates of oxford nanopore sequencing, we developed a novel pipeline to capture the barcoded sequences by grepping reads of nanopore amplicon sequencing ( grepore-seq ). grepore-seq can assess nonhomologous end-joining (nhej)-mediated double -stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsodn) insertions with comparable accuracy to illumina next -generation sequencing (ngs). grepore-seq also reveals a full spectrum of homology-directed repair (hdr)-mediated large gene knock -in, correlating well with the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) analysis results. of note, we discovered low-level fragmented and full-length plasmid backbone insertion at the crispr cutting site. therefore, we have established a practical workflow to evaluate various genetic changes, including quantifying insertions of short dsodns, knock-ins of long pieces, plasmid insertions, and large fragment deletions after crispr/cas9-mediated editing. grepore-seq is freely available at github (https://github.com/lisiang/grepore-seq) and the national genomics data center (ngdc) biocode (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/bt007293).",AB_0389
"gain-of-function (gof) variants give rise to increased/novel protein functions whereas loss-of-function (lof) variants lead to diminished protein function. experimental approaches for identifying gof and lof are generally slow and costly, whilst available computational methods have not been optimized to discriminate between gof and lof variants. we have developed logofunc, a machine learning method for predicting pathogenic gof, pathogenic lof, and neutral genetic variants, trained on a broad range of gene-, protein-, and variant-level features describing diverse biological characteristics. logofunc outperforms other tools trained solely to predict pathogenicity for identifying pathogenic gof and lof variants and is available at https://itanlab.shinyapps.io/goflof/.",AB_0389
"esophageal carcinoma ranks as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) being particularly prevalent among asian populations. alternative splicing (as) plays a pivotal role in escc development and progression by generating diverse transcript isoforms. however, the current landscape lacks a specialized database focusing on alternative splicing events (ases) derived from a large number of escc cases. additionally, most existing as databases overlook the contribution of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) in escc molecular mechanisms, predominantly focusing on mrna-based ase identification. to address these limitations, we deployed dases (http://www.hxdsjzx.cn/dases). employing a combination of publicly available and in-house escc rna-seq datasets, our extensive analysis of 346 samples, with 93% being paired tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, led to the identification of 257 novel lncrnas in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. leveraging a paired comparison of tumor and adjacent normal tissues, dases identified 59,094 ases that may be associated with escc. dases fills a critical gap by providing comprehensive insights into ases in escc, encompassing lncrnas and mrna, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of escc molecular mechanisms and serving as a valuable resource for escc research communities.",AB_0389
"backgroundearly detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is important in order to improve patient prognosis and survival rate. methylation sequencing combined with neural networks to identify cell-free dna (cfdna) carrying aberrant methylation offers an appealing and non-invasive approach for hcc detection. however, some limitations exist in traditional methylation detection technologies and models, which may impede their performance in the read-level detection of hcc.methodswe developed a low dna damage and high-fidelity methylation detection method called no end-repair enzymatic methyl-seq (neem-seq). we further developed a read-level neural detection model called deeptrace that can better identify hcc-derived sequencing reads through a pre-trained and fine-tuned neural network. after pre-training on 11 million reads from neem-seq, deeptrace was fine-tuned using 1.2 million hcc-derived reads from tumor tissue dna after noise reduction, and 2.7 million non-tumor reads from non-tumor cfdna. we validated the model using data from 130 individuals with cfdna whole-genome neem-seq at around 1.6x depth.resultsneem-seq overcomes the drawbacks of traditional enzymatic methylation sequencing methods by avoiding the introduction of unmethylation errors in cfdna. deeptrace outperformed other models in identifying hcc-derived reads and detecting hcc individuals. based on the whole-genome neem-seq data of cfdna, our model showed high accuracy of 96.2%, sensitivity of 93.6%, and specificity of 98.5% in the validation cohort consisting of 62 hcc patients, 48 liver disease patients, and 20 healthy individuals. in the early stage of hcc (bclc 0/a and tnm i), the sensitivity of deeptrace was 89.6 and 89.5% respectively, outperforming alpha fetoprotein (afp) which showed much lower sensitivity in both bclc 0/a (50.5%) and tnm i (44.7%).conclusionsby combining high-fidelity methylation data from neem-seq with the deeptrace model, our method has great potential for hcc early detection with high sensitivity and specificity, making it potentially suitable for clinical applications.deeptrace: https://github.com/bamrock/deeptraceconclusionsby combining high-fidelity methylation data from neem-seq with the deeptrace model, our method has great potential for hcc early detection with high sensitivity and specificity, making it potentially suitable for clinical applications.deeptrace: https://github.com/bamrock/deeptrace",AB_0389
"background as an important food and cash crop, identification of dna molecular markers is of great significance for molecular marker-assisted breeding of sorghum (sorghum bicolor (l.) moench). although some sorghum-related mutation databases have been published, the special ssr and sv databases still need to be constructed and updated.results in this study, the quality of 18 different sorghum genomes was evaluated, and two genomes were assembled at chromosome level. through the identification and comparative analysis of ssr loci in these genomes, the distribution characteristics of ssr in the above sorghum genomes were initially revealed. at the same time, five representative reference genomes were selected to identify the structural variation of sorghum. finally, a convenient ssr/sv database of sorghum was constructed by integrating the above results (http://www.sorghum.top:8079/;http://43.154.129.150:8079/;http://47.106.184.91:8079/). users can query the information of related sites and primer pairs.conclusions anyway, our research provides convenience for sorghum researchers and will play an active role in sorghum molecular marker-assisted breeding.",AB_0389
"backgroundthe advancement of single-cell sequencing has progressed our ability to solve biological questions. cell type annotation is of vital importance to this process, allowing for the analysis and interpretation of enormous single-cell datasets. at present, however, manual cell annotation which is the predominant approach remains limited by both speed and the requirement of expert knowledge.methodsto address these challenges, we constructed a hierarchically organized marker map through manually curating over 26,000 cell marker entries from about 7000 publications. we then developed wise, a weighted and integrated gene set enrichment method, to integrate the prevalence of canonical markers and ordered differentially expressed genes of specific cell types in the marker map. benchmarking analysis suggested that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods.resultsby integrating the marker map and wise, we developed a user-friendly and convenient web server, act (http://xteam.xbio.top/act/ or http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/act/), which only takes a simple list of upregulated genes as input and provides interactive hierarchy maps, together with well-designed charts and statistical information, to accelerate the assignment of cell identities and made the results comparable to expert manual annotation. besides, a pan-tissue marker map was constructed to assist in cell assignments in less-studied tissues. applying act to three case studies showed that all cell clusters were quickly and accurately annotated, and multi-level and more refined cell types were identified.conclusionswe developed a knowledge-based resource and a corresponding method, together with an intuitive graphical web interface, for cell type annotation. we believe that act, emerging as a powerful tool for cell type annotation, would be widely used in single-cell research and considerably accelerate the process of cell type identification.",AB_0389
"introduction nowadays, invasive prostate biopsy is the standard diagnostic test for patients with suspected prostate cancer (pca). however, it has some shortcomings such as perioperative complications, economic and psychological burden on patients, and some patients may undergo repeated prostate biopsy. in this study protocol, our aim is to provide a non-invasive diagnostic strategy we call the 'prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) combined model' for the diagnosis of pca. if patients are diagnosed with pca using psma combined model, we want to prove these patients can receive radical prostatectomy directly without prior prostate biopsies.methods the snotob trial adopts a prospective, single-centre, single-arm, open-label study design. the psma combined model consists of a diagnostic model based on what we previously reported and f-18-psma-1007 positron emission tomography/ct (f-18-psma-1007 pet/ct) examinations in series. first, patients use the diagnostic model (online address: https://ustcprostatecancerprediction.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/) to calculate the risk probability of clinically significant pca (cspca). when the risk probability of cspca is equal or greater than 0.60, f-18-psma-1007 pet/ct will be applied for further diagnosis. if patients are still considered as cspca after f-18-psma-1007 pet/ct examinations, we define this condition as positive results of psma combined model. subsequently, we will recommend these patients to accept radical prostatectomy without prostate biopsy directly. finally, the diagnostic performance of psma combined model will be verified with the pathological results. totally, 57 patients need to be enrolled in this clinical trial.ethics and dissemination this study was approved by the ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of ustc (no. 2022ky-142). the results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and reported at academic conferences.",AB_0389
"background:neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy is an important therapeutic modality for resectable nonsmall cell lung cancer (nsclc). the roles of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (nlr), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio in predicting the efficacy and prognosis of patients with resectable nsclc receiving neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy remain uncertain. this study aimed to explore the association of baseline and preoperative nlr, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio with the treatment response and survival of patients with resectable nsclc treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.materials and methods:data of patients with resectable nsclc treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy between may 2019 and july 2022 at our institute, were retrospectively analyzed. peripheral blood cell counts were obtained at baseline and before surgery. data that may affect treatment efficacy were also collected and analyzed, including age, sex, bmi, cumulative smoking exposure, pathological type, clinical stage, pd-l1 tumor proportion score, immune checkpoint inhibitors, dosage of neoadjuvant therapy, duration from final therapy to surgery, and baseline and preoperative oncological markers. the present work has been reported in compliance with reporting recommendations for tumor marker prognostic studies (remark) criteria and guidelines (supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/js9/a860).results:a total of 116 patients were included in the study. univariate logistic regression analysis showed that a higher baseline nlr (p=0.001) and preoperative nlr (p=0.001) were associated with a lower incidence of pathological complete response (pcr) following neoadjuvant therapy. multivariate analysis indicated that a lower incidence of pcr was achieved in the high baseline nlr group (p=0.014). higher baseline nlr (p=0.021), preoperative nlr (p=0.004) and higher preoperative cea levels (p=0.059) were associated with shorter disease-free survival (dfs). multivariate cox proportional hazard regression analyses showed that shorter dfs was achieved in the high preoperative nlr group (p=0.033).conclusion:in patients with resectable nsclc treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, a higher baseline nlr was associated with a lower incidence of pcr, and a higher preoperative nlr was associated with a shorter dfs. however, a future prospective study with a large sample size and long-term follow-up is needed to verify the predictive value of nlr in these patients.",AB_0389
