"to deploy convolutional neural networks (cnns) on resource-limited devices, binary cnns with 1-bit activations and weights prove to be a promising approach. meanwhile, neural architecture search (nas), which can design lightweight networks beyond artificial ones, has achieved optimal performance in various tasks. to design high-performance binary networks, we propose an efficient binary neural architecture search algorithm, namely ebnas. in this paper, we propose corresponding improvement strategies to deal with the information loss due to binarization, the discrete error between search and evaluation, and the imbalanced operation advantage in the search space. specifically, we adopt a new search space consisting of operations suitable for the binary domain. an l2 path regularization and a variance-based edge regularization are introduced to guide the search process and drive architecture parameters toward discretization. in addition, we present a search space simplification strategy and adjust the channel sampling proportions to balance the advantages of different operations. we perform extensive experiments on cifar10, cifar100, and imagenet datasets. the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. for example, with binary weights and activations, ebnas achieves a top-1 accuracy of 95.61% on cifar10, 78.10% on cifar100, and 67.8% on imagenet. with a similar number of model parameters, our algorithm outperforms other binary nas methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. compared with manually designed binary networks, our algorithm remains competitive. the code is available at https://github.com/sscckk/ebnas.",AB_0195
"carter and gilovich (2012) investigated the centrality of experiential and material purchases to the self and concluded people have stronger associations with their experiential than their material purchases. in a pre-registered experiment with a us american amazon mechanical turk sample, (n=743), we successfully replicated their studies 3a, 3b, 3c, and 5. experiential purchases were perceived as more reflective of true-self than material purchases for both self (d=0.65[0.57,0.73]) and for strangers (d=0.88[0.80,0.96]), and that when meeting a new person, information about experiential purchases was considered to be more insightful (d=1.13[1.04,1.22]), useful (d=1.14[1.05,1.23]), and fun to talk about (d=1.96[1.83,2.08]) than material purchases. self-concept was more strongly associated with experiential purchases than with material purchases (d=0.39[0.25,0.54]), and that there was a negative association between experiential purchase satisfaction and the willingness to exchange memory (r=-.34[-.43,-.24]) (all effects above were p<.001). we added an extension examining change in evaluations of material and experiential purchases over time and found that current evaluations were more negative than past evaluations, yet to a lesser extent for experiential compared to material purchases. materials, data, and code are available on: https://osf.io/v2w5h/",AB_0195
"human-perceived thermal comfort (known as human-perceived temperature) measures the combined effects of multiple meteorological factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, and wind speed) and can be aggravated under the influences of global warming and local human activities. with the most rapid urbanization and the largest population, china is being severely threatened by aggravating human thermal stress. however, the vari-ations of thermal stress in china at a fine scale have not been fully understood. this gap is mainly due to the lack of a high-resolution gridded dataset of human thermal indices. here, we generated the first high spatial resolution (1 km) dataset of monthly human thermal index collection (hitic-monthly) over china during 2003- 2020. in this collection, 12 commonly used thermal indices were generated by the light gradient boosting machine (lightgbm) learning algorithm from multi-source data, including land surface temperature, topogra-phy, land cover, population density, and impervious surface fraction. their accuracies were comprehensively assessed based on the observations at 2419 weather stations across the mainland of china. the results show that our dataset has desirable accuracies, with the mean r-2, root mean square error, and mean absolute error of 0.996, 0.693 degrees c, and 0.512 degrees c, respectively, by averaging the 12 indices. moreover, the data exhibit high agree-ments with the observations across spatial and temporal dimensions, demonstrating the broad applicability of our dataset. a comparison with two existing datasets also suggests that our high-resolution dataset can describe a more explicit spatial distribution of the thermal information, showing great potentials in fine-scale (e.g., intra-urban) studies. further investigation reveals that nearly all thermal indices exhibit increasing trends in most parts of china during 2003-2020. the increase is especially significant in north china, southwest china, the tibetan plateau, and parts of northwest china, during spring and summer. the hitic-monthly dataset is publicly available from zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6895533 (zhang et al., 2022a).",AB_0195
"backgroundreliable predictive models for predicting excessive and poor ovarian response in controlled ovarian stimulation (cos) is currently lacking. the dynamic (delta) inhibin b, which refers to increment of inhibin b responding to exogenous gonadotropin, has been indicated as a potential predictor of ovarian response. objectiveto establish mathematical models to predict ovarian response at the early phase of cos using delta inhibin b and other biomarkers. materials and methodsprospective cohort study in a tertiary teaching hospital, including 669 cycles underwent standard gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh) antagonist ovarian stimulation between april 2020 and september 2020. early delta inhibin b was defined as an increment in inhibin b from menstrual day 2 to day 6 through to the day of cos. least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) logistic regression with 5-fold cross-validation was applied to construct ovarian response prediction models. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc), prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity were used for evaluating model performance. resultsearly delta inhibin b and basal antimullerian hormone (amh) levels were the best measures in building models for predicting ovarian hypo- or hyper-responses, with aucs and ranges of 0.948 (0.887-0.976) and 0.904 (0.836-0.945) in the validation set, respectively. the contribution of the early delta inhibin b was 67.7% in the poor response prediction model and 56.4% in the excessive response prediction model. the basal amh level contributed 16.0% in the poor response prediction model and 25.0% in the excessive response prediction model. an online website-based tool (http://121.43.113.123:8001/) has been developed to make these complex algorithms available in clinical practice. conclusionearly delta inhibin b might be a novel biomarker for predicting ovarian response in ivf cycles. limiting the two prediction models to the high and the very-low risk groups would achieve satisfactory performances and clinical significance. these novel models might help in counseling patients on their estimated ovarian response and reduce iatrogenic poor or excessive ovarian responses.",AB_0195
"numerous underwater image enhancement methods have been proposed in recent years. however, these methods are mainly evaluated using synthetic datasets with similar degradation or real-world datasets with insufficient images. a benchmark dataset containing various degraded situations and real-world underwater images is needed to evaluate the performance of these methods. in this paper, we propose a real-world underwater image dataset (uidef), which consists of seven categories and eleven subcategories with 9200 real-world underwater images. these categories roughly cover the multiple degradation types and different shooting perspectives of common underwater imagery. using this dataset, we conduct a qualitative and quantitative empirical comparison of eight state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement methods to evaluate their effectiveness and robustness. considering that these methods cannot handle both color restoration and contrast enhancement of the underwater degraded images well, we present a color-contrast complementary image enhancement framework that consists of the adaptive color perception balance and multi-scale weighted fusion. the former procedure is essential to remove the color cast of original input images, while the latter defines four attentive weight maps for making the enhanced output images present a more comfortable visual perception. extensive experiments have validated that our framework achieves relatively satisfactory performance in most cases. in addition, we demonstrate an additional application of uidef in reconstructing a wider-field underwater image based on multiple images with overlapping regions. the dataset is available at https://github.com/laibinchang/uidef.git.",AB_0195
"protein-protein interactions (ppis) govern cellular pathways and processes, by significantly influencing the functional expression of proteins. therefore, accurate identification of protein-protein interaction binding sites has become a key step in the functional analysis of proteins. however, since most computational methods are designed based on biological features, there are no available protein language models to directly encode amino acid sequences into distributed vector representations to model their characteristics for protein protein binding events. moreover, the number of experimentally detected protein interaction sites is much smaller than that of protein-protein interactions or protein sites in protein complexes, resulting in unbalanced data sets that leave room for improvement in their performance. to address these problems, we develop an ensemble deep learning model (edlm)-based protein-protein interaction (ppi) site identification method (edlmppi). evaluation results show that edlmppi outperforms state-of-the-art techniques including several ppi site prediction models on three widely-used benchmark datasets including dset_448, dset_72, and dset_164, which demonstrated that edlmppi is superior to those ppi site prediction models by nearly 10% in terms of average precision. in addition, the biological and interpretable analyses provide new insights into protein binding site identification and characterization mechanisms from different perspectives. the edlmppi webserver is available at http://www.edlmppi.top:5002/.",AB_0195
"wetlands, often called the kidneys of the earth , play an important role in maintaining ecological balance, conserving water resources, replenishing groundwater and controlling soil erosion. wetland mapping is very challenging because of its complicated temporal dynamics and large spatial and spectral heterogeneity. an accurate global 30 m wetland dataset that can simultaneously cover inland and coastal zones is lacking. this study proposes a novel method for wetland mapping by combining an automatic sample extraction method, existing multi-sourced products, satellite time-series images and a stratified classification strategy. this approach allowed for the generation of the first global 30 m wetland map with a fine classification system (gwl_fcs30), including five inland wetland sub-categories (permanent water, swamp, marsh, flooded flat and saline) and three coastal tidal wetland sub-categories (mangrove, salt marsh and tidal flats), which was developed using google earth engine platform. we first combined existing multi-sourced global wetland products, expert knowledge, training sample refinement rules and visual interpretation to generate large and geographically distributed wetland training samples. second, we integrated the landsat reflectance time-series products and sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (sar) imagery to generate various water-level and phenological information to capture the complicated temporal dynamics and spectral heterogeneity of wetlands. third, we applied a stratified classification strategy and the local adaptive random forest classification models to produce the wetland dataset with a fine classification system at each 5 degrees x5 degrees geographical tile in 2020. lastly, gwl_fcs30, mosaicked by 961 5 degrees x5 degrees regional wetland maps, was validated using 25 708 validation samples, which achieved an overall accuracy of 86.44 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.822. the cross-comparisons with other global wetland products demonstrated that the gwl_fcs30 dataset performed better in capturing the spatial patterns of wetlands and had significant advantages over the diversity of wetland sub-categories. the statistical analysis showed that the global wetland area reached 6.38 million km(2), including 6.03 million km(2) of inland wetlands and 0.35 million km(2) of coastal tidal wetlands, approximately 72.96 % of which were distributed poleward of 40 degrees n. therefore, we can conclude that the proposed method is suitable for large-area wetland mapping and that the gwl_fcs30 dataset is an accurate wetland mapping product that has the potential to provide vital support for wetland management. the gwl_fcs30 dataset in 2020 is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7340516 (liu et al., 2022).",AB_0195
"emotion measurement is crucial to conducting emotion research. numerous studies have extensively employed textual scales for psychological and organizational behavior research. however, emotions are transient states of organisms with relatively short duration, some insurmountable limitations of textual scales have been reported, including low reliability for single measurement or susceptibility to learning effects for multiple repeated use. in the present article, we introduce the highly dynamic and reusable picture-based scale (hdrps), which was randomly generated based on 3,386 realistic, high-quality photographs that are divided into five categories (people, animals, plants, objects, and scenes). affective ratings of the photographs were gathered from 14 experts and 209 professional judges. the hdrps was validated using the self-assessment manikin and the panas by 751 participants. with an accuracy of 89.73%, this new tool allows researchers to measure individual emotions continuously for their research. the noncommercial use of the hdrps system can be freely accessible by request at http://syy.imagesoft.cc:8989/pictures.7z. hdrps is used for non-commercial academic research only. as some of the images are collected through the open network, it is difficult to trace the source, so please contact the author if there are any copyright issues.",AB_0195
"n4-methylcytosine (4mc) is an important dna chemical modification pattern which is a new methylation modification discovered in recent years and plays critical roles in gene expression regulation, defense against invading genetic elements, genomic imprinting, and so on. identifying 4mc site from dna sequence segment contributes to discovering more novel modification patterns. in this paper, we present a model called 4mcbert that encodes dna sequence segments by sequence characteristics including one-hot, electron-ion interaction pseudopotential, nucleotide chemical property, word2vec and chemical information containing physicochemical properties (pcp), chemical bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (chemical bert) and em-ploys ensemble learning framework to develop a prediction model. pcp and chemical bert features are firstly constructed and applied to predict 4mc sites and show positive contributions to identifying 4mc. for the matthew's correlation coefficient, 4mcbert significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art models on six independent benchmark datasets including a. thaliana, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, e. coli, g. pickering, and g. subterraneous by 4.32 % to 24.39 %, 2.52 % to 31.65 %, 2 % to 16.49 %, 6.63 % to 35.15, 8.59 % to 61.85 %, and 8.45 % to 34.45 %. moreover, 4mcbert is designed to allow users to predict 4mc sites and retrain 4mc prediction models. in brief, 4mcbert shows higher performance on six benchmark datasets by incorporating sequence-and chemical-driven information and is available at http://cczubio.top/4mcbert and https://github. com/abcair/4mcbert.",AB_0195
"high-dimensional small sample size data, which may lead to singularity in computation, are becoming increasingly common in the field of pattern recognition. moreover, it is still an open problem how to extract the most suitable low-dimensional features for the support vector machine (svm) and simultaneously avoid singularity so as to enhance the svm's performance. to address these problems, this article designs a novel framework that integrates the discriminative feature extraction and sparse feature selection into the support vector framework to make full use of the classifiers' characteristics to find the optimal/maximal classification margin. as such, the extracted low-dimensional features from high-dimensional data are more suitable for svm to obtain good performance. thus, a novel algorithm, called the maximal margin svm (msvm), is proposed to achieve this goal. an alternatively iterative learning strategy is adopted in msvm to learn the optimal discriminative sparse subspace and the corresponding support vectors. the mechanism and the essence of the designed msvm are revealed. the computational complexity and convergence are also analyzed and validated. experimental results on some well-known databases (including breastmnist, pneumoniamnist, colon-cancer, etc.) show the great potential of msvm against classical discriminant analysis methods and svm-related methods, and the codes can be available on http://www.scholat.com/laizhihui.",AB_0195
