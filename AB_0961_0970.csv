"image complexity (ic) is an essential visual perception for human beings to understand an image. however, explicitly evaluating the ic is challenging, and has long been overlooked since, on the one hand, the evaluation of ic is relatively subjective due to its dependence on human perception, and on the other hand, the ic is semantic-dependent while real-world images are diverse. to facilitate the research of ic assessment in this deep learning era, we built the first, to our best knowledge, large-scale ic dataset with 9,600 well-annotated images. the images are of diverse areas such as abstract, paintings and real-world scenes, each of which is elaborately annotated by 17 human contributors. powered by this high-quality dataset, we further provide a base model to predict the ic scores and estimate the complexity density maps in a weakly supervised way. the model is verified to be effective, and correlates well with human perception (with the pearson correlation coefficient being 0.949). last but not the least, we have empirically validated that the exploration of ic can provide auxiliary information and boost the performance of a wide range of computer vision tasks. the dataset and source code can be found at https://github.com/tinglyfeng/ic9600.",AB_0097
"in this work, we study the challenging problem of instance-aware human body part parsing. we introduce a new bottom-up regime which achieves the task through learning category-level human semantic segmentation as well as multi-person pose estimation in a joint and end-to-end manner. the output is a compact, efficient and powerful framework that exploits structural information over different human granularities and eases the difficulty of person partitioning. specifically, a dense-to-sparse projection field, which allows explicitly associating dense human semantics with sparse keypoints, is learnt and progressively improved over the network feature pyramid for robustness. then, the difficult pixel grouping problem is cast as an easier, multi-person joint assembling task. by formulating joint association as maximum-weight bipartite matching, we develop two novel algorithms based on projected gradient descent and unbalanced optimal transport, respectively, to solve the matching problem differentiablly. these algorithms make our method end-to-end trainable and allow back-propagating the grouping error to directly supervise multi-granularity human representation learning. this is significantly distinguished from current bottom-up human parsers or pose estimators which require sophisticated post-processing or heuristic greedy algorithms. extensive experiments on three instance-aware human parsing datasets (i.e., mhp-v2, densepose-coco, pascal-person-part) demonstrate that our approach outperforms most existing human parsers with much more efficient inference. our code is available at https://github.com/tfzhou/mg-humanparsing.",AB_0097
"background:anastomotic leak after restorative surgery for rectal cancer is a major complication and may lead to worse long-term oncological and survival outcomes.objective:the purpose of this study was to identify risk factors associated with anastomotic leak and to assess the perioperative and long-term oncological impact of anastomotic leak in our cohort of patients with rectal cancer.design:a retrospective analysis was performed on data from the prospectively maintained cabrini monash colorectal neoplasia database. patients who had undergone rectal cancer resection and subsequently received anastomosis between november 2009 and may 2020 were included in this study. patient and tumor characteristics, technical risk factors, and short-term and perioperative as well as long-term oncological and survival outcomes were assessed.settings:the study was conducted in 3 tertiary hospitals.patients:a total of 693 patients met the inclusion criteria for this study.main outcome measures:univariate analyses were performed to assess the relationship between anastomotic leak and patient and technical risk factors, as well as perioperative and long-term outcomes. univariate and multivariate proportional hr models of overall and disease-free survival were calculated. kaplan-meier survival analyses assessed disease-free and overall survival.results:anastomotic leak rate was 3.75%. males had an increased risk of anastomotic leak, as did patients with hypertension and ischemic heart disease. patients who experience an anastomotic leak were more likely to require reoperation and hospital readmission and were more likely to experience an inpatient death. disease-free and overall survival were also negatively impacted by anastomotic leaks.limitations:this is a retrospective analysis of data from only 3 centers with the usual limitations. however, these effects have been minimized because of the high quality and completeness of the prospective data collection.conclusions:anastomotic leaks after restorative surgery negatively affect long-term oncological and survival outcomes for patients with rectal cancer. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c81.",AB_0097
"background: the predictive value of sarcopenia for tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is unclear. objective: this study aimed to investigate the association between sarcopenia and pathological tumor regression grade after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. design: retrospective cohort study from a prospectively collected database. univariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between sarcopenia and tumor response. settings: this study was conducted at 2 tertiary care centers. patients: participants were patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (t3/4, n0/+) between 2007 and 2018. intervention: sarcopenia was diagnosed using sex-specific cutoffs of lean muscle mass. using the initial staging ct, lean muscle mass was estimated using the cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra, normalized for patient height. main outcome measures: the primary end point was pathological tumor regression grade, defined as good (tumor regression grade 0/1) vs poor (tumor regression grade 2/3). results: the study included 167 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer with a median age of 60 (20-91) years, with 132 in the nonsarcopenia group and 35 in the sarcopenia group. eightynine percent of patients had stage 3 cancer. nine patients ( 5.4%) had a complete clinical response, 1 patient did not respond to treatment and opted for nonoperative management, and the remaining 157 patients ( 94.0%) proceeded to surgery. pathological data revealed no significant difference between good tumor regression grade patients in the sarcopenia group compared with the nonsarcopenia group. univariate analysis revealed bmi >= 25 kg/m(2) to be a risk factor for good tumor regression grade (p = 0.002). limitations: this study was limited by its retrospective design and small sample size. conclusions: sarcopenia is not a predictor of poor neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. increasing bmi was associated with good tumor regression grade. future multicentered studies are warranted to validate this finding. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/ dcr/c78.",AB_0097
"background:the diagnostic implications of lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, perineural invasion, and tumor budding in rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy are unknown.objective:this study aimed to identify the prognostic impact of lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, perineural invasion, and tumor budding in locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.design:this was a retrospective cohort study.settings:this study was conducted at the samsung medical center. grouping was performed on the basis of lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, perineural invasion, and tumor budding status: no-risk group with 0 factor (n = 299), low-risk group with any 1 factor (n = 131), intermediate-risk group with any 2 factors (n = 75), and high-risk group with 3 or 4 risk factors (n = 32).patients:patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, followed by radical operation for locally advanced rectal cancer, from january 2010 to december 2015 were included.main outcome measures:the main outcome measures were disease-free and overall survival.results:disease-free and overall survival varied significantly between the groups in stage iii (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). disease-free survival in stage i differed between the no-risk group and the intermediate-risk group (p = 0.026). in stage ii, disease-free and overall survival differed between the no-risk group and the intermediate-risk group (p = 0.010 and p = 0.045). in multivariable analysis, risk grouping was an independent prognostic factor for both disease-free (p <0.001) and overall survival (p < 0.001).limitations:the inherent limitations are associated with the retrospective single-center study design.conclusions:lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, perineural invasion, and tumor budding are strong prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survival in locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy is strongly recommended in patients with positive lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, perineural invasion, and tumor budding. see video abstract at http://links. lww.com/dcr/b919.",AB_0097
"background: we previously reported in an uncontrolled study that tiotropium alleviated chronic cough in asthma refractory to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting b2 agonists (ics/laba) by modulating capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity (c-crs). objective: we sought to determine the antitussive effects of tiotropium for refractory cough in asthma in a randomized, parallel, open-label trial. methods: a total of 58 patients with asthma having chronic cough refractory to ics/laba were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to add tiotropium 5mg (39 patients) or theophylline 400 mg (19 patients) for 4 weeks. patients underwent workups, including capsaicin cough challenge test and subjective measures such as cough severity visual analog scales (vas). we adopted c5, the lowest capsaicin concentration to induce at least 5 coughs, as an index of c-crs. we also performed a posthoc analysis to identify factors predicting tiotropium responders, who found an improvement of at least 15 mm in cough severity vas. results: a total of 52 patients (tiotropium, 38; theophylline, 14) completed the study. both tiotropium and theophylline significantly improved cough severity vas and cough-specific quality of life. tiotropium, but not theophylline, significantly increased c5, whereas pulmonary function did not change in either group. in addition, changes in cough severity vas correlated with changes in c5 values in the tiotropium group. a posthoc analysis revealed that heightened c-crs (c5 =1.22 mm) before the addition of tiotropium was an independent predictor for tiotropium responders. conclusion: tiotropium may alleviate chronic cough in asthma refractory to ics/laba by modulating c-crs. heightened c-crs may predict responsiveness to tiotropium for refractory cough in asthma. trial registration: clinical trials registry id: umin000021064 (https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ (c) 2023 american college of allergy, asthma & immunology. published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0097
"this study, performed under the umbrella of the task force on hemispheric transport of air pollution (tf-htap), responds to the global and regional atmospheric modelling community's need of a mosaic emission inventory of air pollutants that conforms to specific requirements: global coverage, long time series, spatially distributed emissions with high time resolution, and a high sectoral resolution. the mosaic approach of integrating official regional emission inventories based on locally reported data, with a global inventory based on a globally consistent methodology, allows modellers to perform simulations of high scientific quality while also ensuring that the results remain relevant to policymakers.htap_v3, an ad hoc global mosaic of anthropogenic inventories, has been developed by integrating official inventories over specific areas (north america, europe, asia including japan and south korea) with the independent emissions database for global atmospheric research (edgar) inventory for the remaining world regions. the results are spatially and temporally distributed emissions of so2, nox, co, non-methane volatile organic compounds (nmvocs), nh3, pm10, pm2.5, black carbon (bc), and organic carbon (oc), with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees and time intervals of months and years, covering the period 2000-2018 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7516361, crippa, 2023, https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_htap_v3, last access: june 2023). the emissions are further disaggregated into 16 anthropogenic emitting sectors. this paper describes the methodology applied to develop such an emission mosaic, reports on source allocation, differences among existing inventories, and best practices for the mosaic compilation. one of the key strengths of the htap_v3 emission mosaic is its temporal coverage, enabling the analysis of emission trends over the past 2 decades. the development of a global emission mosaic over such long time series represents a unique product for global air quality modelling and for better-informed policymaking, reflecting the community effort expended by the tf-htap to disentangle the complexity of transboundary transport of air pollution.",AB_0097
"background acute coronary syndromes are commonly caused by the rupture of vulnerable plaque, which often appear angiographically not severe. although pharmacologic management is considered standard therapy for stabilizing plaque vulnerability, the potential role of preventive local treatment for vulnerable plaque has not yet been determined. the prevent trial was designed to compare preventive percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) plus optimal medical therapy (omt) with omt alone in patients with functionally nonsignificant high-risk vulnerable plaques.methods the prevent trial is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, open-label, active-treatment-controlled random-ized trial. eligible patients have at least 1 angiographically significant stenosis (diameter stenosis > 50% by visual estimation) without functional significance (fractional flow reserve [ffr] > 0.80). target lesions are assessed by intracoronary imaging and must meet at least 2 imaging criteria for vulnerable plaque; (1) minimal lumen area < 4.0 mm2; (2) plaque burden > 70%; (3) maximal lipid core burden index in a 4 mm segment > 315 by near infrared spectroscopy; and (4) thin cap fibroatheroma as determined by virtual histology or optical coherence tomography. enrolled patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either preventive pci with either bioabsorbable vascular scaffolds or metallic everolimus-eluting stents plus omt or omt alone. the primary endpoint is target-vessel failure, defined as the composite of death from cardiac causes, target-vessel myocardial infarction, ischemic-driven target-vessel revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable or progressive angina, at 2 years after randomization.results enrollment of a total of 1,608 patients has been completed. follow-up of the last enrolled patient will be completed in september 2023 and primary results are expected to be available in early 2024.conclusions the prevent trial is the first large-scale, randomized trial to evaluate the effect of preventive pci on non- flow-limiting vulnerable plaques containing multiple high-risk features that is appropriately powered for clinical outcomes. prevent will provide compelling evidence as to whether preventive pci of vulnerable plaques plus omt improves patient outcomes compared with omt alone. clinical trial registration url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . unique identifier: nct02316886.key points the prevent trial is the first, large-scale randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of preventive pci on non-flow-limiting vulnerable plaque with high-risk features. it will provide compelling evidence to determine whether pci of focal vulnerable plaques on top of omt improves patient outcomes.",AB_0097
"recovering an outdoor environment's surface mesh is vital for an agricultural robot during task planning and remote visualization. image-based dense 3d reconstruction is sensitive to large movements between adjacent frames and the quality of the estimated depth maps. our proposed solution for these problems is based on a newly-designed panoramic stereo camera along with a hybrid novel software framework that consists of three fusion modules: disparity fusion, pose fusion, and volumetric fusion. the panoramic stereo camera with a pentagon shape consists of 5 stereo vision camera pairs to stream synchronized panoramic stereo images for the following three fusion modules. in the disparity fusion module, rectified stereo images produce the initial disparity maps using multiple stereo vision algorithms. then, these initial disparity maps, along with the intensity images, are input into a disparity fusion network to produce refined disparity maps. next, the refined disparity maps are converted into full-view (360 degrees) point clouds or single-view (72 degrees) point clouds for the pose fusion module. the pose fusion module adopts a two-stage global-coarse-to-local-fine strategy. in the first stage, each pair of full-view point clouds is registered by a global point cloud matching algorithm to estimate the transformation for a global pose graph's edge, which effectively implements loop closure. in the second stage, a local point cloud matching algorithm is used to match single-view point clouds in different nodes. next, we locally refine the poses of all corresponding edges in the global pose graph using three proposed rules, thus constructing a refined pose graph. the refined pose graph is optimized to produce a global pose trajectory for volumetric fusion. in the volumetric fusion module, the global poses of all the nodes are used to integrate the single-view point clouds into the volume to produce the mesh of the whole garden. the proposed framework and its three fusion modules are tested on a real outdoor garden dataset to show the superiority of the performance. the whole pipeline takes about 4 min on a desktop computer to process the real garden dataset, which is available at: https://github.com/canpu999/trimbot-wageningen-slam-dataset.",AB_0097
"as the demand for realistic representation and its applications increases rapidly, 3d human modeling via a single rgb image has become the essential technique. owing to the great success of deep neural networks, various learning-based approaches have been introduced for this task. however, partial occlusions still give the difficulty to accurately estimate the 3d human model. in this letter, we propose the part-attentive kinematic regressor for 3d human modeling. the key idea of the proposed method is to predict body part attentions based on each body center position and estimate parameters of the 3d human model via corresponding attentive features through the kinematic chain-based decoder in a one-stage fashion. one important advantage is that the proposed method has a good ability to yield natural shapes and poses even with severe occlusions. experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is effective for 3d human modeling under complicated real-world environments. the code and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/dcvl-3d/pkcn_release",AB_0097
