"objective: to investigate the effect of surgical intervention on 24-h abp in children with osa. it was hypothesized that blood pressure would improve following adenotonsillectomy.methods: this was a two-centered investigator-blinded randomized controlled trial. non-obese pre-pubertal children aged 6-11 years with osa (obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, oahi >3/h) underwent 24-h abp monitoring at baseline and 9 months after the randomly assigned intervention, i.e. early surgery (es) or watchful waiting (ww). intention-to-treat analysis was performed.results: 137 subjects were randomized. sixty-two (age: 7.9y +/- 1.3, 71% boys) and 47 (age: 8.5y +/- 1.6, 77% boys) participants from the es and ww groups, respectively completed the study. changes in abp pa-rameters were similar in the es and ww groups (nighttime systolic bp z-scores: +0.03 +/- 0.93 vs.-0.06 +/- 1.04, p = 0.65; nighttime diastolic bp z-scores:-0.20 +/- 0.95 vs.-0.02 +/- 1.00, p = 0.35) despite a greater improvement in osa in the es group. however, a reduction in nighttime diastolic bp z-score correlated with improvements in osa severity indexes (r = 0.21-0.22, p < 0.05), and a significant improvement in nighttime diastolic bp z-score [-0.43 +/- 1.01, p = 0.027] following surgery was observed in participants with severe preoperative osa (oahi >= 10/h). the es group had a significant increase in body mass index z-score after surgery [+0.27 +/- 0.57, p < 0.001], which correlated with the increase in daytime systolic bp z-score (r = 0.2, p < 0.05).conclusion: surgical treatment did not lead to significant improvements in abp in osa children except in those with more severe disease. the improvement in bp was partially masked by the weight gain following surgery. clinical trial registration: the trial was registered with the chinese clinical trial registry (http://www. chictr.org.cn. registration number: chictr-trc-14004131).(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0178
"in real-world scenarios, new audio classes with insufficient samples usually emerge continually, which motivates the study of few-shot class-incremental audio classification (fcac) in this paper. fcac aims to enable the model to recognize new audio classes while remembering the base ones continually. to solve the fcac problem, the discriminability of the prototypes is vital to the model's classification performance. thus, we proposed a method to learn the discriminative prototypes from two aspects. first, since the generalization ability of the embedding module (em) significantly affects the discriminability of the prototypes, the proposed method employs a scheme of pseudo-episodic incremental training to train the em by simulating the test scenario. second, to enable the model to achieve a balanced classification performance on both base and new audio classes, the proposed method employs a selective-attention module to adjust different prototypes to enhance their discriminability. extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in solving the fcac problem. notably, the proposed method achieves a comprehensive performance score (cps) of 87.82% and 59.25% on the neural synthesis musical notes of 100 classes (nsynth-100) and free sound clips of 89 classes (fsc-89) datasets, respectively, which outperforms the comparison methods. our code is available at https://github.com/chester-w-xie/dpl_fcac.",AB_0178
"background: china has the world's largest diabetic population, and the cost of caring for all these people every day is substantial. online information exchange and app usage frequency have been demonstrated to play a significant influence in the management of blood glucose and enhancement of diabetes-related quality of life. however, the association between online information exchange and app usage frequency among actual online populations remains unclear and deserves additional study. therefore, we evaluated the factors affecting the frequency of app usage in the online glucose management population, with a particular emphasis on the connection between online information exchange and app use frequency, contributing to the expansion of the research of diabetes management models. method: this cross-sectional study was conducted by disseminating questionnaires in blood glucose management-related forums and wechat groups and included 1586 online users concerned about blood glucose management. information exchange and app usage frequency were considered as independent and dependent variables, respectively. we performed stratified and single factor analysis, multiple equation regression analysis, smooth curve fitting, and threshold effect and saturation effect analysis. r (version 4.1.3, http://www.rproject.org) and empowerstats were used for data analysis. result: after adjusting for other covariates, information exchange was independently and positively associated with app use frequency (beta = 8.6, 95% ci: 6.5 to 11.2, p < 0.001). through interaction analysis, the most significant interaction factors influencing the relationship between information exchange and app usage frequency were identified as health insurance status, whether living with parents, glycated hemoglobin status in the previous month, and self-monitoring of blood glucose (smbg). the association between information exchange and app usage frequency is u-shaped, with information exchange inflection points of 3.0 and 4.2. information exchange and app usage frequency are negatively correlated when the average information exchange score is less than 3.0, and for every point increase in the average information exchange score, the likelihood of the app high usage frequency group compared to the app low usage frequency group decreases by 70%. the relationship between information exchange and app usage frequency is strongest when it is greater than or equal to 3.0 and less than or equal to 4.2. the probability of the app high usage frequency group occurring compared to the app low usage frequency group rises 17.3 times for every 1 point increase in the average information exchange score. the probability of the app high usage frequency group occurring in comparison to the app low usage frequency group increased by 1.8 times for every 1 point rise in information exchange when the average information exchange score was higher than 4.2. conclusion: age, body mass index, married, living with parents, hemoglobin level, smbg, and information exchange were positively connected with app usage frequency in our study of online blood glucose management population. the link between information exchange and app use frequency was significantly u-shaped. the app usage frequency changed the most with the rise in information exchange when the information exchange score was greater than or equal to 3.0 and less than or equal to 4.2. therefore, we ought to offer effort to concentrate on and increase the health-related behaviors and activities of those in this score interval.",AB_0178
"heterogeneous graph embedding (hge) is receiving a great attention from researchers, as it can be widely and effectively used to solve problems from various real-world applications. the existing hge models mainly learn node representation directly on the whole heterogeneous graph by aggregating neighboring information, which unavoidably leads to the loss of useful high-order information. another mainstream is to split heterogeneous graphs into different homogeneous subgraphs and then learn representations separately. however, this isolated handling way is prone to the loss of important interactions between the nodes of the same type. to address the above challenging but interesting problems, we propose an original graph and subgraph aggregated graph neural network (osgnn). specifically, we first split the original heterogeneous graph into several subgraphs, and then weighted combine them to get a new meaningful homogeneous graph. finally, the first-order and high-order information of the target node are learned from the original heterogeneous graph and the homogeneous subgraph respectively and concatenated as the final node representation. extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. the source codes of this work are available on https://github.com/ zzy-graphmininglab/osgnn.",AB_0178

"background and aim: the prediction models of postoperative survival for hepatitis b virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma ( hbv- hcc) with microvascular invasion ( mvi) have not been well established. the study objective was the development of nomograms to predict disease recurrence and overall survival (os) in these patients. methods: data were obtained from 1046 hbv- related mvi-positive hcc patients who had undergone curative resection from january 2014 to december 2017. the study was approved by the eastern hepatobiliary surgery hospital and jinling hospital ethics committee, and patients provided informed consent for the use of their data. nomograms for recurrence and os were created by cox regression model in the training cohort (n=530). the modes were verified in an internal validation cohort (n= 265) and an external validation cohort (n= 251). results: the nomograms of recurrence and os based on preoperative serological indicators (hbv-dna, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, a-fetoprotein), tumor clinicopathologic features (diameter, number), surgical margin and postoperative adjuvant tace achieved high c- indexes of 0.722 ( 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.711-0.732) and 0.759 (95% ci, 0.747-0.771) in the training cohort, respectively, which were significantly higher than conventional hcc staging systems (bclc, cnlc, hklc).the nomograms were validated in the internal validation cohort (0.747 for recurrence, 0.758 for os) and external validation cohort(0.719 for recurrence, 0.714 for os) had well-fitted calibration curves. our nomograms accurately stratified patients with hbv-hcc with mvi into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups of postsurgical recurrence and mortality. prediction models for recurrence- free survival ( https:// baishileiehbh. shinyapps. io/ hbv- mvi- hcc- rfs/) and os ( https:// baishileiehbh.shinyapps.io/hbv-mvi-hcc-os/) were constructed. conclusions: the two nomograms showed good predictive performance and accurately distinguished different recurrence and os by the nomograms scores for hbv-hcc patients with mvi after resection.",AB_0178
"background & aims: complex communications between hepatocytes and kupffer cells (kcs) are known to drive or suppress hepatocarcinogenesis, with controversial data in the literature. in previous experiments that aimed to decipher he-patocyte/kc interactions, we unexpectedly unveiled a tumor-suppressing effect of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, a widely used inducer of mx dynamin like gtpase 1 (mx1)-cre expres-sion, which questioned a theory of interleukin 1a/6 cytokine circuit in hepatocyte/kc communication. the goal of this study was to clarify the controversy and decipher unique functions of kcs and non-kc macrophages in liver tumorigenesis.methods: we used the c-type lectin domain family 4 member f (clec4f)-cre system to delete src-homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (shp2)/protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 11 (ptpn11) in kcs, and a combination of clec4f-cre and adeno-associated virus-cre to delete shp2 in kcs and he-patocytes to investigate the effects on hepatocellular carcinoma development and immune cell compositions/activities.results: ablating shp2 in kcs generated a tumor-promoting niche, which was exacerbated further by concurrent removal of shp2 in both kcs and hepatocytes. shp2 deficiency induced kc apoptosis and decreased its numbers, which induced compen-satory recruitment of bone marrow-derived monocytes into liver. these newly recruited monocytes differentiated into non-kc macrophages with tumor-associated macrophage function, lead-ing to aggravated tumor progression through down-regulation of cd8 t cells. tumor-associated macrophage blockade by anti-chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2 (ccl2) antibody inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma progression, while depletion of all macrophages had a tumor-promoting effect by increasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (m-mdscs) and decreasing cd8 t cells. conclusions: shp2 loss in kcs or hepatocytes generated a protumorigenic microenvironment, which was exacerbated by its removal in both cell types. these results show the complexity of intercellular signaling events in liver tumori-genesis and raises caution on the use of specific shp2 inhibitor in liver cancer therapy. transcript profiling: rna sequencing data are available at gene expression omnibus (gse222594).

"background & aims: metabolic reprogramming is recog-nized as a cancer hallmark intimately linked to tumor hypoxia, which supports rapid tumor growth and mitigates the conse-quential oxidative stress. phosphofructokinase-fructose bisphosphatase (pfkfb) is a family of bidirectional glycolytic enzymes possessing both kinase and phosphatase functions and has emerged as important oncogene in multiple types of cancer. however, its clinical relevance, functional significance, and underlying mechanistic insights in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), the primary malignancy that develops in the most important metabolic organ, has never been addressed. methods: pfkfb4 expression was examined by rna sequencing in the cancer genome atlas and our in-house hcc cohort. the up-regulation of pfkfb4 expression was confirmed further by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in an expanded hepatitis b virus-associated hcc cohort followed by clinicopathologic correlation analysis. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)/crispr-associated protein 9 (cas9)-mediated pfkfb4 knockout cells were generated for functional characterization in vivo, targeted metabolomic profiling, as well as rna sequencing analysis to comprehensively examine the impact of pfkfb4 loss in hcc. results: pfkfb4 expression was up-regulated significantly in hcc and correlated positively with tp53 and tsc2 loss-of -function mutations. in silico transcriptome-based analysis further revealed pfkfb4 functions as a critical hypoxia-inducible gene. clinically, pfkfb4 up-regulation was associ-ated with more aggressive tumor behavior. functionally, crispr/cas9-mediated pfkfb4 knockout significantly impaired in vivo hcc development. targeted metabolomic profiling revealed that pfkfb4 functions as a phosphatase in hcc and its ablation caused an accumulation of metabolites in downstream glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. in addition, pfkfb4 loss induced hypoxia-responsive genes in glycolysis and reactive oxygen species detoxification. conversely, ectopic pfkfb4 expression conferred sorafenib resistance. conclusions: pfkfb4 up-regulation supports hcc devel-opment and shows therapeutic implications.
