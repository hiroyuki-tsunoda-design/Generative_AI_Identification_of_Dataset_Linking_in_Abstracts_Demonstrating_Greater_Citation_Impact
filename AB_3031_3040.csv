"deep learning (dl)-based specific emitter identification (sei) is a potential physical layer authentication technique for industrial internet-of-things (iiot) security, which detects the individual emitter according to its unique signal features resulting from transmitter hardware impairments. the success of dl-based sei often depends on sufficient training samples and the integrity of samples' labels. the extensive deployment of wireless devices generates a huge amount of signals, but signals labeling is quite difficult and expensive with the high demand for expertise. in this article, we present an sei method based on dual consistency regularization (dcr), which enables feature extraction and identification using a few labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples. with the help of pseudo labeling, we leverage consistency between the predicted class distribution of weakly augmented unlabeled training samples and that of strongly augmented training unlabeled samples, and consistency between semantic feature distribution of labeled samples and that of pseudo-labeled samples, which takes the unlabeled samples into account to model parameter tuning for a more accurate emitter identification. extensive numerical results demonstrate that compared with well-known semi-supervised learning-based sei methods, our method obtains 99.77% identification accuracy on a wifi data set and 90.10% identification accuracy on an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ads-b) data set when only 10% of training samples are labeled, and improves the identification accuracy on the wifi data set and the ads-b data set by more than 19.07% and 5.30%, respectively. our codes are available at https://github.com/lovelymimola/dcr-based-semisei.",AB_0304
"despite significant progress, there remain three limitations to the previous multi-view clustering algorithms. first, they often suffer from high computational complexity, restricting their feasibility for large-scale datasets. second, they typically fuse multi-view information via one-stage fusion, neglecting the possibilities in multi-stage fusions. third, dataset-specific hyperparameter-tuning is frequently required, further undermining their practicability. in light of this, we propose a fast multi-view clustering via ensembles (fastmice) approach. particularly, the concept of random view groups is presented to capture the versatile view-wise relationships, through which the hybrid early-late fusion strategy is designed to enable efficient multi-stage fusions. with multiple views extended to many view groups, three levels of diversity (w.r.t. features, anchors, and neighbors, respectively) are jointly leveraged for constructing the view-sharing bipartite graphs in the early-stage fusion. then, a set of diversified base clusterings for different view groups are obtained via fast graph partitioning, which are further formulated into a unified bipartite graph for final clustering in the late-stage fusion. notably, fastmice has almost linear time and space complexity, and is free of dataset-specific tuning. experiments on 22 multi-view datasets demonstrate its advantages in scalability (for extremely large datasets), superiority (in clustering performance), and simplicity (to be applied) over the state-of-the-art. code available: https://github.com/ huangdonghere/fastmice.",AB_0304
"piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas), an emergent type of non-coding rnas during oncogenesis, play critical roles in regulating tumor microenvironment. systematic analysis of pirnas' roles in modulating immune pathways is important for tumor immunotherapy. in this study, in-depth analysis of pirnas was performed to develop an integrated computational algorithm, the immunology pirna (immpi) pipeline, for uncovering the global expression landscape of pirnas and identifying their regulatory roles in immune pathways. the immunology pirnas show a tendency towards overexpression patterns in immune cells, causing perturbations in tumors, being significantly associated with infiltration of immune cells, and having prognostic value. the immpi score can contribute to prioritizing tumor-related pirnas and distinguish two subtypes of skcm (immune-cold and hot phenotypes), as characterized by different prognoses, immunogenicity and antitumor immunity. finally, we developed an interactive web resource (immpi portal: http://www.hbpding.com/immpi) for the biomedical research community, with several useful modules to browse, visualize, and download the results of immunology pirnas analysis. overall, our work provides a comprehensive landscape of pirnas across multiple cancer types and sheds light on their regulatory and functional roles in tumor immunity. these findings pave the way for future research and development of pirna-based immunotherapies for cancer treatment.",AB_0304
"the brain is constituted of heterogeneous types of neuronal and non-neuronal cells, which are organized into distinct anatomical regions, and show precise regulation of gene expression during development, aging and function. in the current database release, stab2 provides a systematic cellular map of the human and mouse brain by integrating recently published large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus rna-sequencing datasets from diverse regions and across lifespan. we applied a hierarchical strategy of unsupervised clustering on the integrated single-cell transcriptomic datasets to precisely annotate the cell types and subtypes in the human and mouse brain. currently, stab2 includes 71 and 61 different cell subtypes defined in the human and mouse brain, respectively. it covers 63 subregions and 15 developmental stages of human brain, and 38 subregions and 30 developmental stages of mouse brain, generating a comprehensive atlas for exploring spatiotemporal transcriptomic dynamics in the mammalian brain. we also augmented web interfaces for querying and visualizing the gene expression in specific cell types. stab2 is freely available at https://mai.fudan.edu.cn/stab2. graphical abstract",AB_0304
"traditional chinese medicine (tcm) is increasingly recognized and utilized worldwide. however, the complex ingredients of tcm and their interactions with the human body make elucidating molecular mechanisms challenging, which greatly hinders the modernization of tcm. in 2016, we developed batman-tcm 1.0, which is an integrated database of tcm ingredient-target protein interaction (tti) for pharmacology research. here, to address the growing need for a higher coverage tti dataset, and using omics data to screen active tcm ingredients or herbs for complex disease treatment, we updated batman-tcm to version 2.0 (http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/batman-tcm/). using the same protocol as version 1.0, we collected 17 068 known ttis by manual curation (with a 62.3-fold increase), and predicted similar to 2.3 million high-confidence ttis. in addition, we incorporated three new features into the updated version: (i) it enables simultaneous exploration of the target of tcm ingredient for pharmacology research and tcm ingredients binding to target proteins for drug discovery; (ii) it has significantly expanded tti coverage; and (iii) the website was redesigned for better user experience and higher speed. we believe that batman-tcm 2.0, as a discovery repository, will contribute to the study of tcm molecular mechanisms and the development of new drugs for complex diseases. graphical abstract",AB_0304
"bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria or archaea. understanding the diverse and intricate genomic architectures of phages is essential to study microbial ecosystems and develop phage therapy strategies. however, the existing phage databases are short of meticulous annotations. to this end, we propose phagescope (https://phagescope.deepomics.org), an online phage database with comprehensive annotations. phagescope harbors a collection of 873 718 phage sequences from various sources. applying fifteen state-of-the-art tools to perform systematic annotations and analyses, phagescope provides annotations on genome completeness, host range, lifestyle information, taxonomy classification, nine types of structural and functional genetic elements, and three types of comparative genomic studies for curated phages. additionally, phagescope incorporates automatic analyses and visualizations for curated and customized phages, serving as an efficient platform for phage study. graphical abstract",AB_0304
"g-quadruplexes (g4s) are non-canonical four-stranded structures and are emerging as novel genetic regulatory elements. however, a comprehensive genomic annotation of endogenous g4s (eg4s) and systematic characterization of their regulatory network are still lacking, posing major challenges for eg4 research. here, we present endoquad (https://endoquad.chenzxlab.cn/) to address these pressing issues by integrating high-throughput experimental data. first, based on high-quality genome-wide eg4s mapping datasets (human: 1181; mouse: 24; chicken: 2) generated by g4 chip-seq/cut&tag, we generate a reference set of genome-wide eg4s. our multi-omics analyses show that most eg4s are identified in one or a few cell types. the eg4s with higher occurrences across samples are more structurally stable, evolutionarily conserved, enriched in promoter regions, mark highly expressed genes and associate with complex regulatory programs, demonstrating higher confidence level for further experiments. finally, we integrate millions of functional genomic variants and prioritize eg4s with regulatory functions in disease and cancer contexts. these efforts have culminated in the comprehensive and interactive database of experimentally validated dna eg4s. as such, endoquad enables users to easily access, download and repurpose these data for their own research. endoquad will become a one-stop resource for eg4 research and lay the foundation for future functional studies. graphical abstract",AB_0304
"with the rapid development of sequencing technologies, especially the maturity of third-generation sequencing technologies, there has been a significant increase in the number and quality of published genome assemblies. the emergence of these high-quality genomes has raised higher requirements for genome evaluation. although numerous computational methods have been developed to evaluate assembly quality from various perspectives, the selective use of these evaluation methods can be arbitrary and inconvenient for fairly comparing the assembly quality. to address this issue, we have developed the genome assembly evaluating pipeline (gaep), which provides a comprehensive assessment pipeline for evaluating genome quality from multiple perspectives, including continuity, completeness, and correctness. additionally, gaep includes new functions for detecting misassemblies and evaluating the assembly redundancy, which performs well in our testing. gaep is publicly available at https://github.com/zy-optimistic/gaep under the gpl3.0 license. with gaep, users can quickly obtain accurate and reliable evaluation results, facilitating the comparison and selection of high-quality genome assemblies.copyright (c) 2023, the authors. institute of genetics and developmental biology, chinese academy of sciences, and genetics society of china. published by elsevier limited and science press. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0304
"gene regulatory networks (grns) are interpretable graph models encompassing the regulatory interactions between transcription factors (tfs) and their downstream target genes. making sense of the topology and dynamics of grns is fundamental to interpreting the mechanisms of disease etiology and translating corresponding findings into novel therapies. recent advances in single-cell multi-omics techniques have prompted the computational inference of grns from single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data at an unprecedented resolution. here, we present scgrn (https://bio.liclab.net/scgrn/), a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse. the current version of scgrn catalogs 237 051 cell type-specific grns (62 999 692 tf-target gene pairs), covering 160 tissues/cell lines and 1324 single-cell samples. scgrn is the first resource documenting large-scale cell type-specific grn information of diverse human and mouse conditions inferred from single-cell multi-omics data. we have implemented multiple online tools for effective grn analysis, including differential tf-target network analysis, tf enrichment analysis, and pathway downstream analysis. we also provided details about tf binding to promoters, super-enhancers and typical enhancers of target genes in grns. taken together, scgrn is an integrative and useful platform for searching, browsing, analyzing, visualizing and downloading grns of interest, enabling insight into the differences in regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions. graphical abstract",AB_0304
"anti-prokaryotic immune system (apis) proteins, typically encoded by phages, prophages, and plasmids, inhibit prokaryotic immune systems (e.g. restriction modification, toxin-antitoxin, crispr-cas). a growing number of apis genes have been characterized and dispersed in the literature. here we developed dbapis (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbapis), as the first literature curated data repository for experimentally verified apis genes and their associated protein families. the key features of dbapis include: (i) experimentally verified apis genes with their protein sequences, functional annotation, pdb or alphafold predicted structures, genomic context, sequence and structural homologs from different microbiome/virome databases; (ii) classification of apis proteins into sequence-based families and construction of hidden markov models (hmms); (iii) user-friendly web interface for data browsing by the inhibited immune system types or by the hosts, and functions for searching and batch downloading of pre-computed data; (iv) inclusion of all types of apis proteins (except for anti-crisprs) that inhibit a variety of prokaryotic defense systems (e.g. rm, ta, cbass, thoeris, gabija). the current release of dbapis contains 41 verified apis proteins and similar to 4400 sequence homologs of 92 families and 38 clans. dbapis will facilitate the discovery of novel anti-defense genes and genomic islands in phages, by providing a user-friendly data repository and a web resource for an easy homology search against known apis proteins.",AB_0304
