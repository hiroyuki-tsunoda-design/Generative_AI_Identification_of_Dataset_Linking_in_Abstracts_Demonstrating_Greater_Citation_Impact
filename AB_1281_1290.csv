"background remimazolam, as a novel anesthetic, has recently been shown to improve hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction and maintenance; however, it has not been reported in the hypertensive population. this study aimed to compare the effects of remimazolam and propofol on hemodynamic stability in hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.methods we enrolled 120 hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery in this prospective study and randomly allocated them to remimazolam (n = 60) or propofol (n = 60) groups. anesthesia regimens were consistent between groups, except for the administration of remimazolam and propofol. our primary outcome was the incidence of post-induction hypotension, which was either an absolute mean arterial pressure (map) < 60 mmhg or a > 30% relative drop in map compared to baseline within 20 min of induction or from induction to the start of surgery. secondary outcomes included minimum map and map at different time points during anesthesia, the application of vasoactive drugs, adverse events, and the patient's self-reported quality of recovery-40 scale for the day after surgery.results the incidence of post-induction hypotension was lower and the minimum map during induction was higher in the remimazolam group than those in the propofol group. there were no significant differences between the two groups in the remaining outcomes.conclusion remimazolam is safe and effective in hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. induction with remimazolam in hypertensive patients may result in more stable hemodynamics than propofol.trial registrationthis study was registered at the chinese clinical trials registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn) on 03/12/2020, with registration number chictr2000040579.",AB_0129
"metabolic syndrome (ms) is a rapidly growing medical problem worldwide and is characterized by a cluster of age-related metabolic risk factors. the presence of ms increases the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis and significantly raises the morbidity/mortality rate of acute coronary syndrome (acs) patients. early detection of ms is crucial, and biomarkers, particularly blood-based, play a vital role in this process. this cross-sectional study focused on the investigation of certain plasma ceramides (cer14:0, cer16:0, cer18:0, cer20:0, cer22:0, and cer24:1) as potential blood biomarkers for ms due to their previously documented dysregulated function in ms patients. a total of 695 acs patients were enrolled, with 286 diagnosed with ms (acs-ms) and 409 without ms (acs-nonms) serving as the control group. plasma ceramide concentrations were measured by lc-ms/ms assay and analyzed through various statistical methods. the results revealed that cer18:0, cer20:0, cer22:0, and cer24:1 were significantly correlated with the presence of ms risk factors. upon further examination, cer18:0 emerged as a promising biomarker for early ms detection and risk stratification, as its plasma concentration showed a significant sensitivity to minor changes in ms risk status in participants. this cross-sectional observational study was a secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective observational cohort study (chinese clinical trial registry, https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform/network/primary-registries/chinese-clinical-trial-registry-(chictr), chictr-2200056697), conducted from april 2021 to august 2022.",AB_0129
"backgroundthyroid carcinoma (thca), the most common endocrine neoplasm, typically exhibits an indolent behavior. however, in some instances, lymph node metastasis (lnm) may occur in the early stages, with the underlying mechanisms not yet fully understood.materials and methodslnm potential was defined as the tumor's capability to metastasize to lymph nodes at an early stage, even when the tumor volume is small. we performed differential expression analysis using the 'limma' r package and conducted enrichment analyses using the metascape tool. co-expression networks were established using the 'wgcna' r package, with the soft threshold power determined by the 'picksoftthreshold' algorithm. for unsupervised clustering, we utilized the 'consensuscluster plus' r package. to determine the topological features and degree centralities of each node (protein) within the protein-protein interaction (ppi) network, we used the cytonca plugin integrated with the cytoscape tool. immune cell infiltration was assessed using the immune cell abundance identifier (immucellai) database. we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), support vector machine (svm), and random forest (rf) algorithms individually, with the 'glmnet,' 'e1071,' and 'randomforest' r packages, respectively. ridge regression was performed using the 'oncopredict' algorithm, and all the predictions were based on data from the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (gdsc) database. to ascertain the protein expression levels and subcellular localization of genes, we consulted the human protein atlas (hpa) database. molecular docking was carried out using the mcule 1-click docking server online. experimental validation of gene and protein expression levels was conducted through real-time quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) assays.resultsthrough wgcna and ppi network analysis, we identified twelve hub genes as the most relevant to lnm potential from these two modules. these 12 hub genes displayed differential expression in thca and exhibited significant correlations with the downregulation of neutrophil infiltration, as well as the upregulation of dendritic cell and macrophage infiltration, along with activation of the emt pathway in thca. we propose a novel molecular classification approach and provide an online web-based nomogram for evaluating the lnm potential of thca (http://www.empowerstats.net/pmodel/?m=17617_lnm). machine learning algorithms have identified erbb3 as the most critical gene associated with lnm potential in thca. erbb3 exhibits high expression in patients with thca who have experienced lnm or have advanced-stage disease. the differential methylation levels partially explain this differential expression of erbb3. roc analysis has identified erbb3 as a diagnostic marker for thca (auc=0.89), thca with high lnm potential (auc=0.75), and lymph nodes with tumor metastasis (auc=0.86). we have presented a comprehensive review of endocrine disruptor chemical (edc) exposures, environmental toxins, and pharmacological agents that may potentially impact lnm potential. molecular docking revealed a docking score of -10.1 kcal/mol for lapatinib and erbb3, indicating a strong binding affinity.conclusionin conclusion, our study, utilizing bioinformatics analysis techniques, identified gene modules and hub genes influencing lnm potential in thca patients. erbb3 was identified as a key gene with therapeutic implications. we have also developed a novel molecular classification approach and a user-friendly web-based nomogram tool for assessing lnm potential. these findings pave the way for investigations into the mechanisms underlying differences in lnm potential and provide guidance for personalized clinical treatment plans.",AB_0129
"backgroundthe mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) kinase, a central component of the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway, plays a critical role in tumor biology as an attractive therapeutic target. we conducted this first-in-human study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (pk), and pilot efficacy of lxi-15029, an mtorc1/2 dual inhibitor, in chinese patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.methodseligible patients with advanced, unresectable malignant solid tumors after failure of routine therapy or with no standard treatment were enrolled to receive ascending doses (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 110, and 150 mg) of oral lxi-15029 twice daily (bid) (3 + 3 dose-escalation pattern) until disease progression or intolerable adverse events (aes). the primary endpoints were safety and tolerability.resultsbetween june 2017 and july 2021, a total of 24 patients were enrolled. lxi-15029 was well tolerated at all doses. only one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase) occurred in the 150 mg group, and the maximum tolerated dose was 110 mg bid. the most common treatment-related aes were leukocytopenia (41.7%), increased alanine aminotransferase (20.8%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (20.8%), prolonged electrocardiogram qt interval (20.8%), and hypertriglyceridemia (20.8%). no other serious treatment-related aes were reported. lxi-15029 was absorbed rapidly after oral administration. the increases in the peak concentration and the area under the curve were greater than dose proportionality over the dose range. eight patients had stable disease. the disease control rate was 40.0% (8/20; 95% ci 21.7-60.6). in evaluable patients, the median progression-free survival was 29 days (range 29-141).conclusionslxi-15029 demonstrated reasonable safety and tolerability profiles and encouraging preliminary antitumor activity in chinese patients with advanced malignant solid tumors, which warranted further validation in phase ii trials.trial registrationnct03125746(24/04/2017),http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03125746",AB_0129
"backgroundupper limb dysfunction seriously affects the ability of stroke patients to perform activities of daily living. as a popular exercise therapy, tai chi may become an alternative intervention. however, the neurophysiological mechanism by which tai chi improves upper limb dysfunction in stroke patients is still unclear, which limits its further promotion and application. therefore, conducting a strict randomized clinical trial is necessary to observe how tai chi affects upper limb dysfunction in stroke patients and to explore its neurophysiological mechanism.methods/designthis report describes a randomized, parallel-controlled trial with distributive concealment and evaluator blinding. a total of 84 eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the tai chi group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. the participants in the tai chi group will receive 4 weeks of tai chi training: five 60-min sessions a week for a total of 20 sessions. the participants in the control group will not receive tai chi training. both groups will receive medical treatment and routine rehabilitation training. the primary outcome measure is the mean change in the fugl-meyer assessment upper extremity (fma-ue) scale score between baseline and 4 weeks; the secondary outcomes are the mean changes in kinematic characteristics and the wolf motor function test (wmft) and stroke impact scale (sis) scores. in addition, the corticomuscular coupling level and near-infrared brain functional imaging will be monitored to explore the mechanism by which tai chi improves upper limb function of stroke patients.discussionthis randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of tai chi in stroke patients with upper limb dysfunction and explore the neurophysiological mechanism. positive results will verify that tai chi can improve upper limb function of stroke patients.trial registrationchinese clinical trial registration center, chictr2200061376 (retrospectively registered). registered june 22, 2022. http://www.chictr.org.cn/listbycreater.aspx. manuscript version: 3.0 manuscript date: october 10, 2023.",AB_0129
"backgroundoblique lumbar interbody fusion (olif) is an internationally popular minimally invasive technology for the treatment of various lumbar diseases. since its introduction to china in 2014, olif technology has clearly shown its superiority in reconstructing intervertebral stability, restoring intervertebral space height, achieving indirect decompression, and restoring normal lumbar sequence. however, some patients still suffer from persistent symptoms after olif, including low back pain and soreness, which indirectly affect the overall surgical efficacy and patient satisfaction. therefore, some clinicians recommend that patients routinely use spinal orthoses after olif to reduce the stress on the lower back muscles and ligaments, thereby relieving or avoiding postoperative residual symptoms or new symptoms. accordingly, spinal orthosis use after olif has emerged as an essential option. however, the role of spinal orthoses in olif and their specific impact on postoperative patient clinical outcomes have remained unclear, and there is a lack of strong clinical evidence to indirectly or directly support the role of spinal orthoses in olif and demonstrate their impact on patient clinical outcomes. this study aims to investigate the role of spinal orthoses in olif by grouping patients based on the use or nonuse of spinal orthosis after olif, thus providing a better basis for the majority of patients and physicians.methods/designwe plan to conduct a 1-year randomized controlled trial involving 60 subjects. the subjects will be randomized into two groups: group a (those wearing spinal orthoses after surgery) and group b (those not wearing spinal orthoses after surgery). the clinical outcomes of these patients will be evaluated using the oswestry disability index, visual analog scale, and brantigan, steffee, fraser 1 day before surgery and 2 weeks and 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery.discussionthis randomized controlled trial aims to provide a reference for further comprehensive trial design. the findings of this study will provide a better and more scientific basis for the choice of postoperative rehabilitation and treatment for patients undergoing such a procedure.trial registrationthis study has been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry (registration no.: chictr2200059000). registration date: april 22, 2022.registration website: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=166310trial registrationthis study has been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry (registration no.: chictr2200059000). registration date: april 22, 2022.registration website: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=166310",AB_0129
"backgroundup to the present time, there has remained a lack of strong evidence as to whether sentinel lymph node biopsy can replace lymphadenectomy for early endometrial cancer. the traditional surgery for endometrial cancer includes pelvic lymphadenectomy and paraaortic lymph node resection, but complications often seriously affect patients' quality of life. two randomized controlled trials with large samples have proved that lymphadenectomy does not improve the overall recurrence rate and survival rate of patients. on the contrary, it increases the incidence of complications and even mortality. the current trial is designed to clarify whether sentinel lymph node biopsy can replace lymphadenectomy for early endometrial cancer patients with negative lymph nodes.methodsthis study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter and non-inferiority controlled clinical trial in china. potential participants will be patients with pathologically confirmed endometrial cancer at the zhejiang cancer hospital, jiaxing maternity and child health care hospital, and the first hospital of jiaxing in china. the total sample size for this study is 722.patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two groups. patients in one group will undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy + total hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy +/- paraaortic lymph node resection. patients in the other group will undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy + total hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy + pelvic lymphadenectomy +/- paraaortic lymph node resection. the 3-year disease-free survival rate, overall survival rate, quality of life (use eortc qlq-c30 + qlq-cx24), and perioperative related indexes of the two groups will be compared.methodsthis study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter and non-inferiority controlled clinical trial in china. potential participants will be patients with pathologically confirmed endometrial cancer at the zhejiang cancer hospital, jiaxing maternity and child health care hospital, and the first hospital of jiaxing in china. the total sample size for this study is 722.patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two groups. patients in one group will undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy + total hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy +/- paraaortic lymph node resection. patients in the other group will undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy + total hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy + pelvic lymphadenectomy +/- paraaortic lymph node resection. the 3-year disease-free survival rate, overall survival rate, quality of life (use eortc qlq-c30 + qlq-cx24), and perioperative related indexes of the two groups will be compared.resultswe expect to find that for patients with early endometrial cancer, the 3-year disease-free survival rate following sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green combined with near-infrared fluorescence imaging is similar to that following lymphadenectomy. the operation time, as well as incidence of pelvic lymphocyst, lymphedema of lower limb, and edema of vulva in patients who only undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy are expected to be significantly lower than in patients who undergo lymphadenectomy. the quality of life of patients who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy alone will be significantly better than that of patients who undergo lymph node dissection. conclusionthis will prove that the prognosis of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone with indocyanine green combined with near-infrared fluorescence imaging is not inferior to that of sentinel lymph node biopsy plus lymphadenectomy for early stage endometrial cancer with negative nodal assessment intraoperatively. in addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy alone with indocyanine green combined with near-infrared fluorescence imaging results in fewer surgical complications and gives patients better quality of life.trial registrationchictr.org.cn, chictr1900023161. registered 14 may 2019, http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit.aspx?pid=38659&htm=4.",AB_0129
"fall detection is a vital task in health monitoring, as it allows the system to trigger an alert and therefore enable faster interventions when a person experiences a fall. although most previous approaches rely on standard rgb video data, such detailed appearance-aware monitoring poses significant privacy concerns. depth sensors, on the other hand, are better at preserving privacy as they merely capture the distance of objects from the sensor or camera, omitting color and texture information. in this article, we introduce a privacy-supporting solution that makes the rgb-trained model applicable in the depth domain and utilizes depth data at test time for fall detection. to achieve cross-modal fall detection, we present an unsupervised rgb domain to the depth domain (rgb2depth) cross-modal domain adaptation approach that leverages labeled rgb data and unlabeled depth data during training. our proposed pipeline incorporates an intermediate domain module (idm) for feature bridging, modality adversarial loss for modality discrimination, classification loss for pseudo-labeled depth data and labeled source data, triplet loss that considers both the source and target domains, and a novel adaptive loss weight adjustment method for improved coordination among various losses. our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the unsupervised rgb2depth domain adaptation task for fall detection. code is available at https://github.com/1015206533/privacy_supporting_fall_detection.",AB_0129
"the off-road locomotion of wheeled mobile robots (wmrs) over soft terrains can be quite challenging due to the complicated wheel-terrain interaction (wti). to avoid unforeseen non-geometric hazards such as excessive sinkage or slippage, it is crucial to oversee these terrain-related uncertainties. however, determining the appropriate sensing principle for wti and hazard prediction remains an open problem. this letter showcases an onboard sensorized transparent wheel concept (stw) aiming to explicitly characterize the wti over deformable terrains for rovers. the stw configuration can provide directly in-wheel interaction views, thereby offering in-wheel measurement (im) of wti parameters and observations of soil flow simultaneously. unlike traditional vision-based methods, this in-situ wheel vision can characterize the entire contact geometry distributions, eliminating complicated yet inaccurate model-based stochastic estimations. consequently, it can achieve robust and real-time (30 hz) performance even under complex motions. we conduct representative terrain experiments on a single-wheel testbed to verify the performance of our proposed stw system, and showcase its applicability as a terramechanics test tool to remodel wti mechanics, as seen in https://youtu.be/aykw1pp4enw.",AB_0129
