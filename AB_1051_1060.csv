"despite significant progress made in the past few years, challenges remain for depth estimation using a single monocular image. first, it is nontrivial to train a metric-depth prediction model that can generalize well to diverse scenes mainly due to limited training data. thus, researchers have built large-scale relative depth datasets that are much easier to collect. however, existing relative depth estimation models often fail to recover accurate 3d scene shapes due to the unknown depth shift caused by training with the relative depth data. we tackle this problem here and attempt to estimate accurate scene shapes by training on large-scale relative depth data, and estimating the depth shift. to do so, we propose a two-stage framework that first predicts depth up to an unknown scale and shift from a single monocular image, and then exploits 3d point cloud data to predict the depth shift and the camera's focal length that allow us to recover 3d scene shapes. as the two modules are trained separately, we do not need strictly paired training data. in addition, we propose an image-level normalized regression loss and a normal-based geometry loss to improve training with relative depth annotation. we test our depth model on nine unseen datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot evaluation. code is available at: https://github.com/aim-uofa/depth/.",AB_0106
"antimicrobial resistance is a major public health concern. antimicrobial peptides (amps) are one of the host defense mechanisms responding efficiently against multidrug-resistant microbes. since the process of screening amps from a large number of peptides is still high-priced and time-consuming, the development of a precise and rapid computer-aided tool is essential for preliminary amps selection ahead of laboratory experiments. in this study, we proposed amps recognition models using a new peptide encoding method called amino acid index weight (aaiw). four amps recognition models including antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal were trained based on datasets combined from the dramp and other published databases. these models achieved high performance compared to the preceding amps recognition models when evaluated on two independent test sets. all four models yielded over 93% in accuracy and 0.87 in matthew's correlation coefficient (mcc). an online amps recognition server is accessible at https://amppred-aaiw.com.",AB_0106
"background: there is a knowledge gap related to the resource needs of hospital nurses working during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. purpose: to investigate nurses' perceptions of organizational resources and sup-port needs approximately 18 months after the covid-19 pandemic began. method: cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 2,124 u.s. hospital nurses from july to september 2021 findings: there were some misalignments between what resources were provided to nurses and what was perceived as helpful to them. nurses reported increased staffing, compensation, and management and leadership support most fre-quently as resources that could help them continue to provide safe and quality care during and after the pandemic. these were also the resources nurses most frequently reported that they wanted to be provided by their hospitals during the pandemic but were not. discussion: the findings offer valuable insights into how organizations can pre-pare to ensure workforce resilience during future crises. cite this article: cho, h., sagherian, k., & steege, l.m.

"symbolic planning can provide an intuitive interface for non-expert users to operate autonomous robots by abstracting away much of the low-level programming. however, symbolic planners assume that the initially provided abstract domain and problem descriptions are closed and complete. this means that they are fundamentally unable to adapt to changes in the environment or tasks that are not captured by the initial description. we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically extend the abstract description of its skill set upon encountering such a situation. we introduce strategies for generalizing from previous experience, completing sequences of key actions and discovering preconditions to ensure computational efficiency. the resulting system is evaluated on a symbolic planning benchmark task and on object rearrangement tasks in simulation. compared to a monte carlo tree search baseline, our strategies for efficient search have on average a 25% higher success rate at a 67% faster runtime. code is available at https://github.com/ethz-asl/high_level_planning.

"context: circulating adipokines and ghrelin affect bone remodeling by regulating the activation and differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. although the correlation between adipokines, ghrelin, and bone mineral density (bmd) has been studied over the decades, its correlations are still controversial. accordingly, an updated meta-analysis with new findings is needed. objective: this study aimed to explore the impact of serum adipokine and ghrelin levels on bmd and osteoporotic fractures through a meta-analysis. data sources: studies published till october 2020 in medline, embase, and the cochrane library were reviewed. study selection: we included studies that measured at least one serum adipokine level and bmd or fracture risk in healthy individuals. we excluded studies with one or more of the following: patients less than 18 years old, patients with comorbidities, who had undergone metabolic treatment, obese patients, patients with high physical activities, and a study that did not distinguish sex or menopausal status. data extraction: we extracted the data that include the correlation coefficient between adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and ghrelin and bmd, fracture risk by osteoporotic status from eligible studies. data synthesis: a meta-analysis of the pooled correlations between adipokines and bmd was performed, demonstrating that the correlation between leptin and bmd was prominent in postmenopausal women. in most cases, adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with bmd. a meta-analysis was conducted by pooling the mean differences in adipokine levels according to the osteoporotic status. in postmenopausal women, significantly lower leptin (smd = -0.88) and higher adiponectin (smd = 0.94) levels were seen in the osteoporosis group than in the control group. by predicting fracture risk, higher leptin levels were associated with lower fracture risk (hr = 0.68), whereas higher adiponectin levels were associated with an increased fracture risk in men (hr = 1.94) and incident vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women (hr = 1.18). conclusions: serum adipokines levels can utilize to predict osteoporotic status and fracture risk of patients. systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?id=crd42021224855, identifier crd42021224855.",AB_0106
"background: breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that comprises multiple biological components. owing its diversity, patients have different prognostic outcomes; hence, early diagnosis and accurate subtype prediction are critical for treatment. standardized breast cancer subtyping systems, mainly based on single-omics datasets, have been developed to ensure proper treatment in a systematic manner. recently, multi-omics data integration has attracted attention to provide a comprehensive view of patients but poses a challenge due to the high dimensionality. in recent years, deep learning-based approaches have been proposed, but they still present several limitations. results: in this study, we describe mobrca-net, an interpretable deep learning-based breast cancer subtype classification framework that uses multi-omics datasets. three omics datasets comprising gene expression, dna methylation and microrna expression data were integrated while considering the biological relationships among them, and a self-attention module was applied to each omics dataset to capture the relative importance of each feature. the features were then transformed to new representations considering the respective learned importance, allowing mobrca-net to predict the subtype. conclusions: experimental results confirmed that mobrca-net has a significantly enhanced performance compared with other methods, and the effectiveness of multiomics integration and omics-level attention were identified. mobrca-net is publicly available at https://github.com/cbi-bioinfo/mobrca-net.",AB_0106
"this paper introduces a new meta-heuristic technique, named geometric mean optimizer (gmo) that emulates the unique properties of the geometric mean operator in mathematics. this operator can simultaneously evaluate the fitness and diversity of the search agents in the search space. in gmo, the geometric mean of the scaled objective values of a certain agent's opposites is assigned to that agent as its weight representing its overall eligibility to guide the other agents in the search process when solving an optimization problem. furthermore, the gmo has no parameter to tune, contributing its results to be highly reliable. the competence of the gmo in solving optimization problems is verified via implementation on 52 standard benchmark test problems including 23 classical test functions, 29 cec2017 test functions as well as nine constrained engineering problems. the results presented by the gmo are then compared with those offered by several newly proposed and popular meta-heuristic algorithms. the results demonstrate that the gmo significantly outperforms its competitors on a vast range of the problems. source codes of gmo are publicly available at https://github.com/farshadrezaei1/gmo.",AB_0106
"since the brain is the human body's primary command and control center, brain cancer is one of the most dangerous cancers. automatic segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal images is important in diagnosis and treatment. due to the difficulties in obtaining multi-modal paired images in clinical practice, recent studies segment brain tumors solely relying on unpaired images and discarding the available paired images. although these models solve the dependence on paired images, they cannot fully exploit the complementary information from different modalities, resulting in low unimodal segmentation accuracy. hence, this work studies the unimodal segmentation with privileged semi-paired images, i.e., limited paired images are introduced to the training phase. specifically, we present a novel two-step (intra-modality and inter-modality) curriculum disentanglement learning framework. the modality-specific style codes describe the attenuation of tissue features and image contrast, and modality-invariant content codes contain anatomical and functional information extracted from the input images. besides, we address the problem of unthorough decoupling by introducing constraints on the style and content spaces. experiments on the brats2020 dataset highlight that our model outperforms the competing models on unimodal segmentation, achieving average dice scores of 82.91%, 72.62%, and 54.80% for wt (the whole tumor), tc (the tumor core), and et (the enhancing tumor), respectively. finally, we further evaluate our model's variable multi-modal brain tumor segmentation performance by introducing a fusion block (tfusion). the experimental results reveal that our model achieves the best wt segmentation performance for all 15 possible modality combinations with 87.31% average accuracy. in summary, we propose a curriculum disentanglement learning framework for unimodal segmentation with privileged semi-paired images. moreover, the benefits of the improved unimodal segmentation extend to variable multi-modal segmentation, demonstrating that improving the unimodal segmentation performance is significant for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. our code is available at https://github.com/scut-cszcl/spbts.",AB_0106

"genetic studies of alzheimer disease (ad) have prioritized variants in genes related to the amyloid cascade, lipid metabolism, and neuroimmune modulation. however, the cell-specific effect of variants in these genes is not fully understood. here, we perform single-nucleus rna-sequencing (snrna-seq) on nearly 300,000 nuclei from the parietal cortex of ad autosomal dominant (app and psen1) and risk-modifying variant (apoe, trem2 and ms4a) carriers. within individual cell types, we capture genes commonly dysregulated across variant groups. however, specific transcriptional states are more prevalent within variant carriers. trem2 oligodendrocytes show a dysregulated autophagy-lysosomal pathway, ms4a microglia have dysregulated complement cascade genes, and apoe epsilon 4 inhibitory neurons display signs of ferroptosis. all cell types have enriched states in autosomal dominant carriers. we leverage differential expression and single-nucleus atac-seq to map gwas signals to effector cell types including the nck2 signal to neurons in addition to the initially proposed microglia. overall, our results provide insights into the transcriptional diversity resulting from ad genetic architecture and cellular heterogeneity. the data can be explored on the online browser (http://web.hararilab.org/snare/).",AB_0106
