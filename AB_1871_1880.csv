"with the development of plant phenomics, the identification of plant diseases from leaf images has become an effective and economic approach in plant disease science. among the methods of plant diseases identification, the convolutional neural network (cnn) is the most popular one for its superior performance. however, cnn's representation power is still a challenge in dealing with small datasets, which greatly affects its popularization. in this work, we propose a new method, namely pitlid, based on pretrained inception-v3 convolutional neural network and transfer learning to identify plant leaf diseases from phenotype data of plant leaf with small sample size. to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, the experiments on several datasets with small-scale samples were implemented. the results show that pitlid performs better than compared methods. this study provides a plant disease identification tool based on a deep learning algorithm for plant phenomics. all the source data and code are accessible at https://github.com/zhanglab-wbgcas/pitlid.",AB_0188
"dna-binding proteins (dbps) have a significant impact on many life activities, so identification of dbps is a crucial issue. and it is greatly helpful to understand the mechanism of protein-dna interactions. in traditional experimental methods, it is significant time-consuming and labor-consuming to identify dbps. in recent years, many researchers have proposed lots of different dbp identification methods based on machine learning algorithm to overcome shortcomings mentioned above. however, most existing methods cannot get satisfactory results. in this paper, we focus on developing a new predictor of dbps, called multi-view hypergraph restricted kernel machines (mv-h-rkm). in this method, we extract five features from the three views of the proteins. to fuse these features, we couple them by means of the shared hidden vector. besides, we employ the hypergraph regularization to enforce the structure consistency between original features and the hidden vector. experimental results show that the accuracy of mv-h-rkm is 84.09% and 85.48% on pdb1075 and pdb186 data set respectively, and demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/shixuangg/mv-h-rkm.",AB_0188
"therapeutic peptide prediction is critical for drug development and therapeutic therapy. researchers have developed several computational methods to identify different therapeutic peptide types. however, most computational methods focus on identifying the specific type of therapeutic peptides and fail to accurately predict all types of therapeutic peptides. moreover, it is still challenging to utilize different properties features to predict the therapeutic peptides. in this study, a novel stacking framework pretp-stack is proposed for predicting different types of therapeutic peptide. pretp-stack is constructed based on ten different features and four predictors (random forest, linear discriminant analysis, xgboost and support vector machine). then the proposed method constructs an auto-weighted multi-view learning model as a final meta-classifier to enhance the performance of the basic models. experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved better or highly comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods for predicting eight types of therapeutic peptides a user-friendly web-server predictor is available at http://bliulab.net/pretp-stack.",AB_0188
"alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. more and more evidence show that dna methylation is closely related to the pathological mechanism of ad. many ad-associated differentially methylated genes, regions and cpg sites have been identified in recent researches, which may have great potential in clinical research. however, there is no dedicated database to collect ad-related differential methylation up to now. to provide a reference to researchers, we design a database named admeth by manually curating relevant articles, which contains a total of 16,709 ad-related differentially methylated items identified from different brain regions and different cell types in the blood, involving 209 genes, 2,229 regions and 14,271 cpg sites. the admeth database provides user-friendly pages to search, submit and download data. we hope that the admeth database can facilitate researchers to select candidate ad-associated methylation markers in revealing the pathological mechanism of ad and promote the cell-free dna based non-invasive diagnosis of ad. the admeth database is available at http://www.biobdlab.cn/admeth.",AB_0188
"understanding molecular mechanisms involved in calcium-protein interactions and modeling corresponding docking rely on the accurate identification of calcium-binding residues (cabrs). the defects of experimentally annotating protein functions enhances the development of computational approaches that correctly identify calcium-binding interactions. studies have reported that current methods severely cross-predict residues that interact with other types of molecules (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, and small ligands) as cabrs. in this study, a novel predictor named scamper (selective calcium-binding predictor) is proposed for the accurate and specific prediction of cabrs. scamper is designed using newly compiled dataset with complete uniprot sequences and annotations, which include calcium-binding, nucleic acid-binding, protein-binding, and small ligand-binding residues. we use a novel designed two-layer scheme to perform predictions as well as penalize cross-predictions. empirical tests on an independent test dataset reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art predictors. scamper is proved to be capable of distinguishing cabrs from different types of metal-ion binding residues. we further perform cabrs predictions on the whole human proteome, and use the results to hypothesize calcium-binding proteins (cabps). the latest experimental verified cabps and go analysis prove the accuracy of our predictions. we implement the proposed method and share the data at http://www.inforstation.com/webservers/scamper/.",AB_0188
"the understanding of protein functions is critical to many biological problems such as the development of new drugs and new crops. to reduce the huge gap between the increase of protein sequences and annotations of protein functions, many methods have been proposed to deal with this problem. these methods use gene ontology (go) to classify the functions of proteins and consider one go term as a class label. however, they ignore the co-occurrence of go terms that is helpful for protein function prediction. we propose a new deep learning model, named deeppfp-co, which uses graph convolutional network (gcn) to explore and capture the co-occurrence of go terms to improve the protein function prediction performance. in this way, we can further deduce the protein functions by fusing the predicted propensity of the center function and its co-occurrence functions. we use fmax and aupr to evaluate the performance of deeppfp-co and compare deeppfp-co with state-of-the-art methods such as deepgoplus and deepgoa. the computational results show that deeppfp-co outperforms deepgoplus and other methods. moreover, we further analyze our model at the protein level. the results have demonstrated that deeppfp-co improves the performance of protein function prediction. deeppfp-co is available at https://csuligroup.com/deeppfp/.",AB_0188
"the identification of drug-target relations (dtrs) is substantial in drug development. a large number of methods treat dtrs as drug-target interactions (dtis), a binary classification problem. the main drawback of these methods are the lack of reliable negative samples and the absence of many important aspects of dtr, including their dose dependence and quantitative affinities. with increasing number of publications of drug-protein binding affinity data recently, dtrs prediction can be viewed as a regression problem of drug-target affinities (dtas) which reflects how tightly the drug binds to the target and can present more detailed and specific information than dtis. the growth of affinity data enables the use of deep learning architectures, which have been shown to be among the state-of-the-art methods in binding affinity prediction. although relatively effective, due to the black-box nature of deep learning, these models are less biologically interpretable. in this study, we proposed a deep learning-based model, named attentiondta, which uses attention mechanism to predict dtas. different from the models using 3d structures of drug-target complexes or graph representation of drugs and proteins, the novelty of our work is to use attention mechanism to focus on key subsequences which are important in drug and protein sequences when predicting its affinity. we use two separate one-dimensional convolution neural networks (1d-cnns) to extract the semantic information of drug's smiles string and protein's amino acid sequence. furthermore, a two-side multi-head attention mechanism is developed and embedded to our model to explore the relationship between drug features and protein features. we evaluate our model on three established dta benchmark datasets, davis, metz, and kiba. attentiondta outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods under different evaluation metrics. the results show that the attention-based model can effectively extract protein features related to drug information and drug features related to protein information to better predict drug target affinities. it is worth mentioning that we test our model on ic50 dataset, which provides the binding sites between drugs and proteins, to evaluate the ability of our model to locate binding sites. finally, we visualize the attention weight to demonstrate the biological significance of the model. the source code of attentiondta can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhaoqichang/attentiondta_tcbb.",AB_0188
"computational prediction of the rbp bound sites using features learned from existing annotation knowledge is an effective method because high-throughput experiments are complex, expensive and time-consuming. many methods have been proposed to predict rna-protein binding sites. however, the partial information of rna sequence is not fully used. in this study, we propose multiple convolutional neural networks (mcnn) method, which predicts rna-protein binding sites by integrating multiple convolutional neural networks constructed by rna sequence information extracted from windows with different lengths. first, mcnn trains multiple cnns base on rna sequences extracted by different window lengths. second, mcnn can extract more binding patterns of rbps by combining these trained multiple cnns previously. third, mcnn only uses rna base sequence information for rna-protein binding sites prediction, which extracts sequence binding features and predicts the result with same architecture. this avoids the information loss of feature extraction step. our proposed mcnn demonstrates a competitive performance comparing with other methods on a large-scale dataset derived from clip-seq, which is an effective method for rna-protein binding sites prediction. the source code of our proposed mcnn method can be found in https://github.com/biomg/mcnn.",AB_0188
"effective and efficient 3d semantic segmentation from large-scale lidar point cloud is a fundamental problem in the field of autonomous driving. in this paper, we present transformer-range-view network (transrvnet), a novel and powerful projection-based cnn-transformer architecture to infer point-wise semantics. first, a multi residual channel interaction attention module (mrciam) is introduced to capture channel-level multi-scale feature and model intra-channel, inter-channel correlations based on attention mechanism. then, in the encoder stage, we use a well-designed residual context aggregation module (rcam), including a residual dilated convolution structure and a context aggregation module, to fuse information from different receptive fields while reducing the impact of missing points. finally, a balanced non-square-transformer module (bntm) is employed as fundamental component of decoder to achieve locally feature dependencies for more discriminative feature learning by introducing the non-square shifted window strategy. extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on challenging semantickitti and semanticposs benchmarks have verified the effectiveness of our proposed technique. our transrvnet presents superior performance over most existing state-of-the-art approaches. the source code and trained model are available at https://github.com/huixiancheng/transrvnet.",AB_0188
