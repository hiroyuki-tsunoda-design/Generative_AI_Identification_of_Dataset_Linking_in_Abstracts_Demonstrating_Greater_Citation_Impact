"correlation between objects is prone to occur coincidentally, and exploring correlation or association in most situations does not answer scientific questions rich in causality. causal discovery (also called causal inference) infers causal interactions between objects from observational data. reported causal discovery methods and single-cell datasets make applying causal discovery to single cells a promising direction. however, evaluating and choosing causal discovery methods and developing and performing proper workflow remain challenges. we report the workflow and platform causalcell (http://www.gaemons.net/causalcell/causaldiscovery/) for performing single-cell causal discovery. the workflow/platform is developed upon benchmarking four kinds of causal discovery methods and is examined by analyzing multiple single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) datasets. our results suggest that different situations need different methods and the constraint-based pc algorithm with kernel-based conditional independence tests work best in most situations. related issues are discussed and tips for best practices are given. inferred causal interactions in single cells provide valuable clues for investigating molecular interactions and gene regulations, identifying critical diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and designing experimental and clinical interventions.",AB_0175
"ethnopharmacological relevance: myelosuppression, also known as bone marrow suppression (bms), is a pathological phenomenon of the decrease in the production of blood cells and further lead to immune homeostasis disorder. astragalus mongholicus bunge (am, checked with the world flora online, http://www.worldfloraonline.org, updated on january 30, 2023) is a traditional chinese medicine with efficacy of tonifying qi and strengthening body immunity in thousands of years of clinical practice in china. astragaloside iv (as-iv) is a major active ingredient of am, which plays an important role in regulating immune system through different ways. aim of the study: this study was aimed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of as-iv on macrophages in vitro and cyclophosphamide (ctx)-induced immunosuppressive mice in vivo, and to provide experimental basis for the prevention and treatment of as-iv in myelosuppression. materials and methods: based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology, the core targets and signaling pathways of saponins of am against myelosuppression were screened. and then, the immunoregulatory effect of as-iv on raw264.7 cells was investigated by cellular immune activity and cellular secretion analysis in vitro. in this way, the effects of as-iv on the main potential targets of hif-1 alpha/nf-kappa b signaling pathway were analyzed by qrt-pcr and western blot methods. furthermore, comprehensive analysis of the effects of as-iv against ctx-induced mice were conducted on the basis of immune organs indices analysis, histopathological analysis, hematological analysis, natural killer cell activity analysis and spleen lymphocyte transformation activity analysis. in order to further verify the relationship between active ingredients and action targets, drug inhibitor experiments were finally conducted. results: as-iv, as a potential anti-myelosuppressive compound, was screened by systematic pharmacological methods to act on target genes including hif1 alpha and rela together with the hif-1 alpha/nf-kappa b signaling pathway. further studies by molecular docking technology showed that as-iv had good binding activity with hif1 alpha, rela, tnf, il6, il1b and other core targets. besides, cellular and animal experiments validation results showed that as-iv could enhance the migration and phagocytosis of raw264.7 cells, and protect the immune organs such as spleen and thymus together with bone tissues from damage. by this means, immune cell function including spleen natural killer cell and lymphocyte transformation activity were also enhanced. in addition, white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets and bone marrow cells were also significantly improved in the suppressed bone marrow microenvironment (bmm). in kinetic experiments, the secretion of cytokines such as tnf-alpha, il-6 and il-1 beta were increased, and il-10, tgf-beta 1 were decreased. the key regulatory proteins such as hif-1 alpha, nf-kappa b, phd3 in hif-1 alpha/nf-kappa b signaling pathway were also regulated in the results of upregulated expression of hif-1 alpha, p-nf-kappa b p65 and phd3 at the protein or mrna level. finally, the inhibition experiment results suggested that as-iv could significantly improve protein response in immunity and inflammation such as hif-1 alpha, nf-kappa b and phd3. conclusion: as-iv could significantly relieve ctx-induced immunosuppressive and might improve the immune activity of macrophages by activating hif-1 alpha/nf-kappa b signaling pathway, and provide a reliable basis for the clinical application of as-iv as a potentially valuable regulator of bmm.",AB_0175
"background: primary dysmenorrhea (pd) afflicts many childbearing-age women, with a high prevalence ranging from 17% to 90%. the dingkun pill (dkp), a traditional chinese medicine formula, has been prescribed for managing menstrual disorders empirically in clinical practice for a long time, but there are very few high-quality studies supporting this practice. therefore, this trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dkp in patients with pd. methods: our study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. dkp or placebo was prescribed to participants from the 5th to 14th day of each menstrual cycle for 12 weeks. changes in pain intensity were measured by a visual analog scale (vas) and were compared between groups using repeated measures analysis. the pain mediators and sex hormones were also assessed before and after the treatment, and their intergroup changes from the baseline were analysed by student t-test. the hemodynamic indices and safety profile of dkp were also investigated. results: a total of 156 women were recruited and randomly allocated to receive either dkp or placebo, of whom 142 (73 in dkp and 69 in sham control) completed the study. a more distinctive reduction in vas scores was observed in the dkp group, compared with placebo (-2.68 +/- 0.21 vs. -1.29 +/- 0.14, p < 0.001). compared to placebo, dkp treatment resulted in a pronounced suppression of serum pgf2 alpha, oxytocin and vasopressin, along with a significant increase in beta-endorphin level (p < 0.001). moreover, uterine artery flow measured by ultrasonography indicated increased blood perfusion after dkp treatment (p < 0.01), while no change was detected in the placebo group. additionally, except for an inhibited serum follicular stimulating hormone (fsh) (p = 0.037), no statistical difference in hormonal status and safety indicators was detected before and after the treatment. conclusions: dkp treatment attenuated pain severity in patients with primary dysmenorrhea, and no harmful side effect was observed during 12 weeks of treatment. clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, nct03953716. registered 17 may 2019. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03953716.",AB_0175
"illegal construction should be detected as early as possible as it can damage the environment and economy. however, the existing methods for detecting illegal construction can be improved in terms of their detection cycles, accuracy, and speed. moreover, there are relatively few valuable real-world image datasets for detecting illegal construction. to address these issues, a high-precision real-time detection model named yemnet and a new large-scale dataset for detection of illegal construction objects (icos) are proposed herein. our yemnet is based on the you only look once v3 object detection model; this model adopts a lightweight convolutional neural network called efficientnet as the backbone for feature extraction. then, yemnet employs a new activation function mish outside the backbone to achieve efficient optimization and strong generalization, thereby improving the recognition accuracy for icos in complicated scenes. our proposed dataset comprises 15 categories and 13,701 photographs of icos captured under different conditions concerning weather, lighting, and natural scenes. extensive experiments on the proposed dataset show that yemnet achieves a mean average precision of 91.41% with fewer parameters, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art object detectors. our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/king-king-king/icos-dataset.

"the worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has had a significant impact on healthcare systems globally. timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for controlling and preventing outbreaks. computed tomography (ct) has been demonstrated as an effective diagnostic tool for covid-19. deep learning techniques have been applied in related fields to solve relevant problems. normally, they achieve good performance on large datasets directly. however, due to the need to protect patient privacy and the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, the amount of publicly available ct data is insufficient for utilizing these methods. in addition, some natural images, which are used for model pre-training, are quite different from chest ct images, causing some inevitable errors. to address these issues, a targeted self-supervised attention network based on an improved inception resnet called siranet is proposed. siranet incorporates a self-supervised learning method during the pre-training process and introduces a attention module to improve feature selection and focus on key informative features. moreover, a transfer learning-based strategy for covid-19 detection is presented and experiments are conducted on three widely used datasets, including imagenet, an unlabeled chest ct dataset, and a covid-19 ct dataset. experimental results show that siranet outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing key informative features from unlabeled and labeled images. the implementation of siranet is available at https://github.com/xiiin6/covid-19.

"the continuous growth of generated sequencing data leads to the development of a variety of associated bioinformatics tools. however, many of them are not able to fully exploit the resources of modern multi-core systems since they are bottlenecked by parsing files leading to slow execution times. this motivates the design of an efficient method for parsing sequencing data that can exploit the power of modern hardware, especially for modern cpus with fast storage devices. we have developed rabbitfx, a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use framework for processing biological sequencing data on modern multi-core platforms. it can efficiently read fasta and fastq files by combining a lightweight parsing method by means of an optimized formatting implementation. furthermore, we provide user-friendly and modularized c++ apis that can be easily integrated into applications in order to increase their file parsing speed. as proof-of-concept, we have integrated rabbitfx into three i/o-intensive applications: fastp, ktrim, and mash. our evaluation shows that the inclusion of rabbitfx leads to speedups of at least 11.6 (6.6), 2.4 (2.4), and 3.7 (3.2) compared to the original versions on plain (gzip-compressed) files, respectively. these case studies demonstrate that rabbitfx can be easily integrated into a variety of ngs analysis tools to significantly reduce associated runtimes. it is open source software available at https://github.com/rabbitbio/rabbitfx.",AB_0175
"dense granule proteins (gras) are secreted by apicomplexa protozoa, which are closely related to an extensive variety of farm animal diseases. predicting gras is an integral part in prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases. considering that biological experiment approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computational method is a superior choice. hence, developing an effective computational method for gras prediction is of urgency. in this paper, we present a novel computational method named gra-gcn through graph convolutional network. in terms of the graph theory, the gras prediction can be regarded as a node classification task. gra-gcn leverages k-nearest neighbor algorithm to construct the feature graph for aggregating more informative representation. to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize computational approach for gras prediction. evaluated by 5-fold cross-validations, the gra-gcn method achieves satisfactory performance, and is superior to four classic machine learning-based methods and three state-of-the-art models. the analysis of the comprehensive experiment results and a case study could offer valuable information for understanding complex mechanisms, and would contribute to accurate prediction of gras. moreover, we also implement a web server at http://dgpd.tlds.cc/gragcn/index/, for facilitating the process of using our model.",AB_0175
"the current data-driven underwater object detection methods have significantly progressed. however, there are millions of marine creatures in the oceans, and collecting a corresponding database for each species for similar tasks (such as object detection)is expensive. besides, marine environments are more complex than in-air cases. water quality, illuminations, and seafloor topography may lead to domain shifting with visual instability features of underwater objects. to tackle these problems, we propose a few-shot adaptive object detection framework with a novel two-stage training approach and a lightweight feature correction module to accommodate both image-level and instance-level domain shifting on multiple datasets. our method can be trained in a source domain and quickly adapt to an unfamiliar target domain with only a few labeled samples. extensive experimental results have demonstrated the knowledge transfer capability of the proposed method in detecting two similar marine species. the code will be available at: https://github.com/roadhan/fscw",AB_0175
"at targets floating on the sea surface get more invisible, it is becoming vital and challenging to effectively detect small targets from strong sea clutter. however, fitting the distribution of sea clutter is a hard task because of the complex characteristics of clutter. classic model-based detectors are prone to suffer from the mismatch problem and a high probability of false alarm (pfa). in this article, a pfacontrollable and data-driven detection method based on an attention-enhanced convolutional neural network (cnn) is proposed. different from mainstream cnn-based detectors, the proposed method takes time-frequency maps obtained by the wigner-ville distribution (wvd) as inputs. then time-frequency maps are converted into feature images as inputs to the designed cnn strengthened with representation powers and feature refinement abilities. the designed cnn is capable of automatically learning and classifying different features between targets and clutter. meanwhile, a pfa control unit is employed to ensure an expected actual pfa. results with the ipix database show that the probability of detection (pd) of the proposed method is about 0.9066 with the pfa being 10(-3 )and the observation time being 1.024 s. compared with five typical feature-based detectors, the proposed method achieves better detection performance. however, results with the sea-detecting radar data-sharing program database also verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed detector. the source codes are available at https://github.com/quqizhe-whu/adn.",AB_0175
"we introduce a novel method using a new generative model that automatically learns effective representations of the target and background appearance to detect, segment and track each instance in a video sequence. differently from current discriminative tracking-by-detection solutions, our proposed hierarchical structural embedding learning can predict more high-quality masks with accurate boundary details over spatio-temporal space via the normalizing flows. we formulate the instance inference procedure as a hierarchical spatio-temporal embedded learning across time and space. given the video clip, our method first coarsely locates pixels belonging to a particular instance with gaussian distribution and then builds a novel mixing distribution to promote the instance boundary by fusing hierarchical appearance embedding information in a coarse-to-fine manner. for the mixing distribution, we utilize a factorization condition normalized flow fashion to estimate the distribution parameters to improve the segmentation performance. comprehensive qualitative, quantitative, and ablation experiments are performed on three representative video instance segmentation benchmarks (i.e., youtube-vis19, youtube-vis21, and ovis) and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated. more impressively, the superior performance of our model on an unsupervised video object segmentation dataset (i.e., davis(19)) proves its generalizability. our algorithm implementations are publicly available at https://github.com/zyqin19/hevis.",AB_0175
