"risky-choice and attribute framing effects are well-known cognitive biases, where choices are influenced by the way information is presented. to assess susceptibility to these framing types, the resistance to framing scale is often used, although its performance has rarely been extensively tested. in an online survey among university students from bulgaria (n = 245) and north america (n = 261), we planned to examine the scale's psychometric properties, structural validity, and measurement invariance. however, some of these examinations were not possible because the scale displayed low and mostly non-significant inter-item correlations as well as low item-total correlations. followingly, exploratory item response theory analyses indicated that the scale's reliability was low, especially for high levels of resistance to framing. this suggests problems with the scale at a basic level of conceptualization, namely that the items may not represent the same content domain. overall, the scale in its current version is of limited use, at least in university student samples, due to the identified problems. we discuss potential remedies to these problems, as well as provide open code and data (https://osf.io/j5n6f) which facilitates testing the scale in other samples (e.g., general population, different languages and countries) to obtain a comprehensive picture of its performance.",AB_0045
"person re-identification (re-id) is an autonomous process that uses raw surveillance images to identify a person across multiple non-overlapping camera views without requiring any kind of hard biometrics like fingerprints, retina patterns or the facial images. the cnn-based deep architectures are most frequently used to solve the person re-id problem. generally these cnn architectures capture the attentive regions of a person at local neighborhood level with increased focal view at the deeper levels of the network. however these do not learn the self-attentions among distant parts of a person's image, which can play a vital role in person re-id especially to handle the inter-class and intra-class variances. in this work, we propose a novel person re-id approach to learn the self-attention among different parts of a person image whether these lie within local proximity or at the far distant regions for robust re-identification. we adapt the vision transformer architecture with a lightweight self-attention module, which learns the global associations among the distinct attentive regions having similar context within a person image. further to this, we escalate the baseline model by acquainting it with a self-context mapping module, which coalesces the contextual embeddings into the self-attention learning for the neighboring and the distant image regions. it helps to capture the globally associated salient regions of a person to get the holistic view at the initial network layers. the proposed self-attention-based re-id architecture outperforms the vanilla cnn counterparts for both of the re-id performance measures, i.e., accuracy and mean average precision. the re-id accuracies are improved 5.5%, 4.6% and 17% for market 1501, dukemtmc-reid and msmt-17 datasets, respectively, as compared to the vanilla cnn-based re-id architectures. the implementation and trained models are made publicly available at https://git.io/jlh2s.",AB_0045
"auditory science increasingly builds on concepts and testing paradigms originated in behavioral psychology and cognitive neuroscience - an evolution of which the resulting discipline is now known as cognitive hearing science. experimental cognitive hearing science paradigms call for hybrid cognitive and psychobehavioral tests such as those relating the attentional system, working memory, and executive functioning to low-level auditory acuity or speech intelligibility. building complex multi-stimuli experiments can rapidly become time-consuming and error-prone. platform-based experiment design can help streamline the implementation of cognitive hearing science experimental paradigms, promote the standardization of experiment design practices, and ensure reliability and control. here, we introduce a set of features for the open-source python-based opensesame platform that allows the rapid implementation of custom behavioral and cognitive hearing science tests, including complex multichannel audio stimuli while interfacing with various synchronous inputs/outputs. our integration includes advanced audio playback capabilities with multiple loudspeakers, an adaptive procedure, compatibility with standard i/os and their synchronization through implementation of the lab streaming layer protocol. we exemplify the capabilities of this extended opensesame platform with an implementation of the three-alternative forced choice amplitude modulation detection test and discuss reliability and performance. the new features are available free of charge from github: https://github.com/elus-om/brm_omexp.",AB_0045
"methods for (pc) quality assessment customarily perform local comparisons between corresponding points in the degraded and pristine pcs. these methods often compare the geometry of the degraded pc and the geometry of the reference pc. more recently, a few methods that use texture information to assess the pc quality have been proposed. in this work, we propose a full-reference point cloud quality assessment (pcqa) metric that combines both geometry and texture information to provide an estimate of the pc quality. we use a projection technique that represents pcs as 2d manifolds in the 3d space. this technique maps attributes from the pcs onto the folded 2d grid, generating a pure-texture 2d image (texture maps) that contains pc texture information. then, we extract statistical features from these texture maps using a multi-scale rotation-invariant texture descriptor named the dominant rotated local binary pattern (drlbp). the texture similarity is computed by measuring the statistical differences between reference and test pcs. the geometrical similarities are computed using geometry-only distances. finally, the texture and geometrical similarities are fused using a stacked regressor to model the pc visual quality. experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. an implementation of the metric described in this paper can be found at https://gitlab.com/gpds-unb/pc-gats-metric.",AB_0045
"objective: the combination of d-methylphenidate and guanfacine (an a-2a adrenergic agonist) may be an effective alternative to either agent as monotherapy in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). this study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying medication effects using cortical source analysis of electroencephalography (eeg) data. method: a total of 172 children with adhd (aged 7-14; 118 boys) completed an 8-week randomized, double-blind, comparative study with 3 treatment arms: d-methylphenidate, guanfacine, or their combination. eeg modulations of brain oscillations at baseline and end point were measured during a spatial working memory task from cortical sources localized within the anterior cingulate (midfrontal) and primary visual cortex (midoccipital), based on previously reported adhd and control differences. linear mixed models examined treatment effects on eeg and performance measures. results: combined treatment decreased midoccipital eeg power across most frequency bands and task phases. several midoccipital eeg measures also showed significantly greater changes with combined treatment than with monotherapies. d-methylphenidate significantly increased midoccipital theta during retrieval, while guanfacine produced only trend-level reductions in midoccipital alpha during maintenance and retrieval. task accuracy improved with combined treatment, was unchanged with d-methylphenidate, and worsened with guanfacine. treatment-related changes in midoccipital power correlated with improvement in adhd severity. conclusion: these findings show that combined treatment ameliorates midoccipital neural activity associated with treatment-related behavioral im-provements and previously implicated in visuo-attentional deficits in adhd. both monotherapies had limited effects on eeg measures, with guanfacine further showing detrimental effects on performance. the identified midoccipital eeg profile may aid future treatment monitoring for children with adhd. clinical trial registration information: single versus combination medication treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (project1); https://clinicaltrials.gov/; nct00429273. diversity & inclusion statement: we worked to ensure race, ethnic, and/or other types of diversity in the recruitment of human participants. we worked to ensure sex and gender balance in the recruitment of human participants. one or more of the authors of this paper self-identifies as a member of one or more historically underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups in science. while citing references scientifically relevant for this work, we also actively worked to promote sex and gender balance in our reference list. we actively worked to promote inclusion of historically underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups in science in our author group. we actively worked to promote sex and gender balance in our author group.",AB_0045
"we describe countersynth, a conditional generative model of diffeomorphic deformations that induce label driven, biologically plausible changes in volumetric brain images. the model is intended to synthesise counterfactual training data augmentations for downstream discriminative modelling tasks where fidelity is limited by data imbalance, distributional instability, confounding, or underspecification, and exhibits inequitable performance across distinct subpopulations.focusing on demographic attributes, we evaluate the quality of synthesised counterfactuals with voxelbased morphometry, classification and regression of the conditioning attributes, and the frechet inception distance. examining downstream discriminative performance in the context of engineered demographic imbalance and confounding, we use uk biobank and oasis magnetic resonance imaging data to benchmark countersynth augmentation against current solutions to these problems. we achieve state-of-the-art improvements, both in overall fidelity and equity. the source code for countersynth is available at https://github.com/guilherme-pombo/countersynth.",AB_0045
"the covid-19 pandemic continues to spread rapidly over the world and causes a tremendous crisis in global human health and the economy. its early detection and diagnosis are crucial for controlling the further spread. many deep learning-based methods have been proposed to assist clinicians in automatic covid-19 diagnosis based on computed tomography imaging. however, challenges still remain, including low data diversity in existing datasets, and unsatisfied detection resulting from insufficient accuracy and sensitivity of deep learning models. to enhance the data diversity, we design augmentation techniques of incremental levels and apply them to the largest open-access benchmark dataset, covidx ct-2a. meanwhile, similarity regularization (sr) derived from contrastive learning is proposed in this study to enable cnns to learn more parameter-efficient representations, thus improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cnns. the results on seven commonly used cnns demonstrate that cnn performance can be improved stably through applying the designed augmentation and sr techniques. in particular, densenet121 with sr achieves an average test accuracy of 99.44% in three trials for three-category classification, including normal, non-covid-19 pneumonia, and covid-19 pneumonia. the achieved precision, sensitivity, and specificity for the covid-19 pneumonia category are 98.40%, 99.59%, and 99.50%, respectively. these statistics suggest that our method has surpassed the existing state-of-the-art methods on the covidx ct-2a dataset. source code is available at https://github.com/yujiakcl/covid-ct-similarity-regularization.",AB_0045
"study objectives: insomnia, depression, and anxiety show high rates of comorbidity and functional impairment. transdiagnostic symptom interactions may be implicated in this comorbidity. this network analysis sought to assess how symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety may interact and indi-vidually predict impairment across several domains for individuals with insomnia. methods: baseline psychometric data from a randomised controlled trial were analysed (n 1/4 1711). a regularized partial correlation network was estimated from the symptom data. centrality (symptom connectivity), community structure (symptom clustering), and bridging (inter-community connectivity) were assessed. the replicability of the network model was assessed via confirmatory analyses in a holdout sample. separately, shapley values were estimated to determine the relative importance of each symptom in predicting functioning (i.e., psychological wellbeing, psychosocial functioning, and physical health impairment).results: the most connected nodes were uncontrollable worrying; trouble relaxing; and depressed mood/hopelessness. five communities were identified with trouble relaxing identified as the bridge symptom between communities. the model showed good fit in the holdout sample. low energy and depressive affect symptoms (feelings of failure/guilt; depressed mood/hopelessness; anhedonia) were key predictors in the relative importance analysis across multiple domains of impairment.conclusion: trouble relaxing may be of clinical and transdiagnostic significance in the context of insomnia. in terms of how symptoms relate to functioning, it was clear that, while low energy and feelings of failure/guilt were prominent predictors, a range of symptoms are associated with functional impairment. consideration of both symptoms and functional impairment across domains may be useful in determining targets for treatment. clinical trial registration: this is a secondary analysis of an original clinical trial. trial registration number: isrctn60530898. registry url: https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn60530898 (c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0045
"motivation: computational identification of copy number variants (cnvs) in sequencing data is a challenging task. existing cnv-detection methods account for various sources of variation and perform different normalization strategies. however, their applicability and predictions are restricted to specific enrichment protocols. here, we introduce a novel tool named varamplicnv, specifically designed for cnv-detection in amplicon-based targeted resequencing data (haloplex (tm) enrichment protocol) in the absence of matched controls. varamplicnv utilizes principal component analysis (pca) and/or metric dimensional scaling (mds) to control variances of amplicon associated read counts enabling effective detection of cnv signals. results: performance of varamplicnv was compared against three existing methods (convading, oncocnv and decon) on data of 167 samples run with an aortic aneurysm gene panel (n = 30), including 9 positive control samples. additionally, we validated the performance on a large deafness gene panel (n = 145) run on 138 samples, containing 4 positive controls. varamplicnv achieved higher sensitivity (100%) and specificity (99.78%) in comparison to competing methods. in addition, unsupervised clustering of cnv segments and visualization plots of amplicons spanning these regions are included as a downstream strategy to filter out false positives. availability and implementation: he tool is freely available through galaxy toolshed and at:https://hub.docker.com/r/cmgantwerpen/varamplicnv.supplementary data file s1:https://tinyurl.com/2yzswyhh;supplementary datafile s2:https://tinyurl.com/ycyf2fb4. contact: maaike.alaerts @uantwerpen.be or geert.vandeweyer@uantwerpen.be supplementary information: supplementary dataare available atbioinformatics online.",AB_0045
"adversarial training is widely used to improve the robustness of deep neural networks to adversarial at-tack. however, adversarial training is prone to overfitting, and the cause is far from clear. this work sheds light on the mechanisms underlying overfitting through analyzing the loss landscape w.r.t. the input. we find that robust overfitting results from standard training, specifically the minimization of the clean loss, and can be mitigated by regularization of the loss gradients. moreover, we find that robust overfitting turns severer during adversarial training partially because the gradient regularization effect of adversar-ial training becomes weaker due to the increase in the loss landscape's curvature. to improve robust generalization, we propose a new regularizer to smooth the loss landscape by penalizing the weighted logits variation along the adversarial direction. our method significantly mitigates robust overfitting and achieves the highest robustness and efficiency compared to similar previous methods. code is available at https://github.com/treelli/combating- ro-advlc .(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (  )",AB_0045
