"reanalysis data play a vital role in weather and climate study as well as meteorological resource development and application. in this work, the east asia reanalysis system (ears) was developed using the weather research and forecasting (wrf) model and the gridpoint statistical interpolations (gsi) data assimilation system. the regional reanalysis system is forced by the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts (ecmwf) global reanalysis era-interim data at 6 h intervals. hourly surface observations are assimilated by the four-dimension data assimilation (fdda) scheme during the wrf model integration; upper observations are assimilated in three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3d-var) mode at the analysis moment. it should be highlighted that many of the assimilated observations have not been used in other reanalysis systems. the reanalysis runs from 1980 to 2018, producing a regional reanalysis dataset covering east asia and surrounding areas at 12 km horizontal resolution, 74 sigma levels, and 3 h intervals. finally, an evaluation of ears has been performed with respect to the root mean square error (rmse), based on the 10-year (2008-2017) observational data. compared to the global reanalysis data of era-interim, the regional reanalysis data of ears are closer to the observations in terms of rmse in both surface and upper-level fields. the present study provides evidence for substantial improvements seen in ears compared to the era-interim reanalysis fields over east asia. the study also demonstrates the potential use of the ears data for applications over east asia and proposes further plans to provide the latest reanalysis in real-time operation mode. simple data and updated information are available on zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7404918 (yin et al., 2022), and the full datasets are publicly accessible on the data-as-a-service platform of the china meteorological administration (cma) at http://data.cma.cn (last access: 19 may 2023).",AB_0167
"circrna is a non-coding rna with a special circular structure, which plays a key role in a variety of life activities by interacting with rna-binding proteins through circrna binding sites. therefore, accurately identifying circrna binding sites is of great importance for gene regulation. in previous studies, most of the methods are based on single-view or multi-view features. considering that single-view methods provide less effective information, the current mainstream methods mainly focus on extracting rich relevant features by constructing multiple views. however, the increasing number of views leads to a large amount of redundant information, which is detrimental to the detection of circrna binding sites. therefore, to solve this problem, we propose to use the channel attention mechanism to further obtain useful multi-view features by filtering out invalid information in each view. first, we use five feature encoding schemes to construct multi-view. then, we calibrate the features by generating the global representation of each view, filtering out redundant information to retain important feature information. finally, features obtained from multiple views are fused to detect rna binding sites. to validate the effectiveness of the method, we compared its performance on 37 circrna-rbp datasets with existing methods. experimental results show that the average auc performance of our method is 93.85%, which is better than the current state-of-the-art methods. we also provide the source code, which can be accessed at https://github.com/dxqllp/ascrb for access.",AB_0167
"asthma is a chronic disease that is caused by a combination of genetic risks and environmental triggers and can affect both adults and children. genome-wide association studies have revealed partly distinct genetic architectures for its two age-of-onset subtypes (namely, adult-onset and childhood-onset). we reason that identifying shared and distinct drug targets between these subtypes may inform the development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies. in attempting this, we here introduce priority index for asthma or pia, a genetics-led and network-driven drug target prioritisation tool for asthma. we demonstrate the validity of the tool in improving drug target prioritisation for asthma compared to the status quo methods, as well as in capturing the underlying etiology and existing therapeutics for the disease. we also illustrate how pia can be used to prioritise drug targets for adult- and childhood-onset asthma, as well as to identify shared and distinct pathway crosstalk genes. shared crosstalk genes are mostly involved in jak-stat signaling, with clinical evidence supporting that targeting this pathway may be a promising drug repurposing opportunity for both subtypes. crosstalk genes specific to childhood-onset asthma are enriched for pi3k-akt-mtor signaling, and we identify genes that are already targeted by licensed medications as repurposed drug candidates for this subtype. we make all our results accessible and reproducible at http://www.genetictargets.com/pia. collectively, our study has significant implications for asthma computational medicine research and can guide the future development of subtype-specific therapeutic strategies for the disease.",AB_0167
"in recent years, unet and its variants have gained astounding success in the realm of medical image processing. however, some unet variant networks enhance their performance while increasing the number of parameters tremendously. for lightweight and performance enhancement jointly considerations, inspired by segnext, we develop a medical image segmentation network model using atrous multi-scale (ams) convolution, named amsunet. in particular, we construct a convolutional attention block ams using atrous and multi-scale convolution, and redesign the downsampling encoder based on this block, called amse. to enhance feature fusion, we design a residual attention mechanism module (i.e., rsc) and apply it to the skip connection. compared with existing models, our model only needs 2.62 m parameters to achieve the purpose of lightweight. according to experimental results on various datasets, the segmentation performance of the designed model is superior for small, medium, and large-scale targets. code will be available at https://github.com/llluochen/ amsunet.",AB_0167
"attributed graph clustering is an essential research topic on real-world data. however, the heterogeneous gap between node and structure features limits the existing approaches for discriminative representation. besides, how to ensure the consistency of clustering assignments produced by the node and structure features is still a challenging problem, which always causes inferior clustering performance. to overcome above problems, a dual-channel network for attributed graph clustering named mutual boost network (mbn) is proposed, which consists of auto-encoder and graph auto-encoder that can interact and learn from each other to achieve mutual boost of clustering performance. first, a novel representation enhancement module is proposed to disseminate the heterogeneous information from both node and structure features for learning comprehensive representation. then, a consistency constraint by contrasting clustering assignments is devised to provide a mutual guide to make them tend to be consistent. finally, the procedures of representation learning and clustering assignment are simultaneously optimized under a unified framework in a self-supervised manner. experimental results on six graph collections show that the mbn performs better than the sota approaches by a statistically significant margin. the mbn code can be found at: https://github.com/xiaoqiang-yan/mbn.",AB_0167
"haze severely degrades the visibility of scene objects and deteriorates the performance of autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and other vision-based intelligent transportation systems. as a potential remedy, we propose a novel unified transformer with semantically contrastive learning for image dehazing, dubbed uscformer. uscformer has three key contributions. first, uscformer absorbs the respective strengths of cnn and transformer by incorporating them into a unified transformer format. thus, it allows the simultaneous capture of global-local dependency features for better image dehazing. second, by casting clean/hazy images as the positive/negative samples, the contrastive constraint encourages the restored image to be closer to the ground-truth images (positives) and away from the hazy ones (negatives). third, we regard the semantic information as important prior knowledge to help uscformer mitigate the effects of haze on the scene and preserve image details and colors by leveraging intra-object semantic correlation. experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world hazy photos fully validate the superiority of uscformer in both perceptual quality assessment and subjective evaluation. code is available at https://github.com/yz-wang/uscformer.",AB_0167
"discriminative least-squares regression (dlsr) has been shown to achieve promising performance in multiclass image classification tasks. its key idea is to force the regression labels of different classes to move in opposite directions by means of the e-dragging technique, yielding a discriminative regression model exhibiting wider margins. however, the e-dragging technique ignores an important problem: its relaxation matrix is dynamically updated in optimization, which means the dragging values can also cause the labels from the same class to be uncorrelated. in order to learn a more powerful projection, as well as regression labels, we propose a fisher regularized e-dragging framework (fisher -e) for image classification by constraining the relaxed labels using the fisher criterion. on the one hand, the fisher criterion improves the intraclass compactness of the relaxed labels during relaxation learning. on the other hand, it is expected further to enhance the interclass separability of e-dragging. fisher -e for the first time ever attempts to integrate the fisher criterion and e-dragging technique into a unified model because they are complementary in learning discriminative projection. extensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed fisher -e method achieves performance that is superior to other state-of-the-art classification methods. the matlab codes are available at https://github.com/chenzhe207/fisher-epsilon.",AB_0167
"objective the authors undertook an evaluation of periprocedural cerebrovascular complications and 30-day out-comes of endovascular treatment for intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (ivadas) and assessed the relevant risk factors. methods the authors included a series of 195 patients who had undergone endovascular treatment for 198 ivadas. clinical data, morphological characteristics, treatment details, and periprocedural cerebrovascular complications includ-ing intraprocedural rupture, intraprocedural thrombosis, intracranial hemorrhage (ich), transient ischemic attack (tia), and ischemic stroke (is) were recorded. after evaluation of the 30-day modified rankin scale (mrs) scores, the authors applied univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the risk factors for complications and 30-day unfavorable clinical outcomes. results there were no intraprocedural ruptures, but the authors recorded intraprocedural thrombosis (n = 5), ich (n = 3), tia (n = 1), and is (n = 13), comprising an 11.1% (22/198) complication rate. multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that hyperlipidemia (odds ratio [or] 3.17, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.20-8.41, p = 0.020), is history (or 5.55, 95% ci 1.46-21.01, p = 0.012), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) (or 4.48, 95% ci 1.52-13.20, p = 0.007) were risk factors for overall complications, whereas aneurysmal height (or 0.77, 95% ci 0.61-0.98, p = 0.032) was a protective factor. sah (or 6.44, 95% ci 1.54-26.89, p = 0.011) and preprocedural mrs score > 2 (or 5.07, 95% ci 1.01-25.59, p = 0.049) were independent risk factors for perforator occlusion stroke. periprocedural cerebrovascular complications (or 32.09, 95% ci 3.00-343.94, p = 0.004) and preprocedural mrs score > 2 (or 319.92, 95% ci 30.28-3379.98, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for 30-day unfavorable clinical outcomes. conclusions hyperlipidemia, is history, and sah were independent predictors for overall periprocedural cerebro-vascular complications of endovascular treatment for ivadas, but aneurysmal height was an independent protective fac-tor. sah and preprocedural mrs score > 2 were independent risk factors for perforator occlusion stroke. preprocedural mrs score > 2 and periprocedural complications were independent risk factors for 30-day unfavorable clinical outcomes. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.10.jns221953",AB_0167
"most supervised geographic mapping methods with very-high-resolution (vhr) images are designed for a specific task, leading to high label-dependency and inadequate task-generality. additionally, the lack of socioeconomic information in vhr images limits their applicability to social/human-related geographic studies. to resolve these two issues, we propose an unsupervised multi-modal geographic representation learning framework (mmgr) using both vhr images and points-of-interest (pois), to learn representations (regional vector embeddings) carrying both the physical and socio-economic properties of the geographies. in mmgr, we employ an intra-modal and an inter-modal contrastive learning module, in which the former deeply mines visual features by contrasting different vhr image augmentations, while the latter fuses physical and socio-economic features by contrasting vhr image and poi features. extensive experiments are performed in two study areas (shanghai and wuhan in china) and three relevant while distinctive geographic mapping tasks (i.e., mapping urban functional distributions, population density, and gross domestic product), to verify the superiority of mmgr. the results demonstrate that the proposed mmgr considerably outperforms seven competitive baselines in all three tasks, which indicates its effectiveness in fusing vhr images and pois for multiple geographic mapping tasks. furthermore, mmgr is a competent pre-training method to help image encoders understand multi-modal geographic information, and it can be further strengthened by fine-tuning even with a few labeled samples. the source code is released at https://github.com/bailubin/mmgr.",AB_0167
"nowadays, the tasks of object extraction from remotely sensed imagery, such as built-up area, water-body, and other earth surface information extraction, heavily rely on annotated sample data due to the wildly used machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning (dl) methods. most algorithms, however, treat image-based annotations as ground truth and ignore the impact of unreliable annotations, leading to low-reliability solutions. additionally, manual annotation quality assessment (aqs) of remote sensing data usually entails a significant workload in actual dataset production, particularly for large datasets. to alleviate these issues, we propose a novel annotation quality assessment network (aqsnet) for the automatic quality assessment of remote sensing annotated samples. it uses a multi-scale channel-spatial attention module to simulate how an inspector examines annotated samples at local and global scales, enhancing the ability to identify poor-quality annotations. besides, we present a simple method for generating effective training samples by analyzing the types and characteristics of low-quality annotated sample data. furthermore, we introduce and make publicly available hbd41, a massive land cover dataset, with 1,945,034 samples of size 512 x 512 pixels. to validate our methodology, two aqs datasets are constructed with hbd4 and public building datasets. on the building aqs dataset, the proposed method outperforms the baseline model (hrnet) by 7.115% in iou and 5.712% on the water-body aqs dataset, respectively. extensive ablation and comparison experiments also demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively assess the quality of remote sensing annotated samples. the high-quality sample data acquired by our aqsnet serves as a pre-trained dataset in the extended applications, from which robust pre-trained weights for downstream tasks are obtained, achieving accurate results with only 5% training samples in the landcover.ai dataset for water-body extraction. to summarize, our method enables the automatic quality assessment of annotated sample data and the construction of high-quality sample data, both of which have the potential to improve the performance of machine learning models in the remote sensing community. the source code and the two constructed aqs datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhilyzhang/aqsnet.",AB_0167
