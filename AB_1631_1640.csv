"the emergence of visually realistic gan-generated facial images has raised concerns regarding potential misuse. in response, effective forensic algorithms have been developed to detect such synthetic images in recent years. however, the vulnerability of such forensic detectors to adversarial attacks remains an important issue that requires further investigation. in this paper, we propose a new black-box attack method against gan-generated image detectors. it involves contrastive learning strategy to train an encoder-decoder anti -forensic network with a contrastive loss function. gan-generated and corresponding simulated real images are constructed as positive and negative samples, respectively. by leveraging the trained attack model, we can apply imperceptible perturbation to input synthetic images for removing gan fingerprint to some extent. gan-generated image detectors may be deceived consequently. extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack effectively reduces the accuracy of three state-of-the-art detectors on six popular gans, while also achieving high visual quality of the attacked images. the source code will be available at https://github.com/zxmmd/battgand.",AB_0164
"non-spherical particulate flow is commonly encountered in nature, industry and our daily life. but up to now, there still lack effective model to describe the adhesive elastic collision between non -spherical microparticles. to solve this problem, a spheropolyhedral-based discrete element method (dem) combined with johnson-kendall-roberts (jkr) model is proposed. the contact between non-spherical particles is attributed to the contacts between three geometry features, including vertice-vertice (v-v), vertice-edge(v-e), vertice-face (v-f) and edge-edge (e-e). the jkr adhesive model is modified to calculate the contact force of the contacting geometry features based on the actual contact area. meanwhile, the lattice boltzmann coupled with the immersed moving boundary (lb-imb) method is employed to simulate the fluid flow and fluid-particle interaction. the novel spheropolyhedral-based de-lbm is verified to be accurate and effective by several experiments and the data in references. finally, an application test for simulating the packing process of non-spherical microparticles is presented. the method well predicts the packing structure of both adhesive and non-adhesive non-spherical particles, meaning that it can be easily extended to simulate the massive non-spherical microparticles with high effectiveness and efficiency.program summaryprogram title: adhesive contact force model for non-spherical particlecpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /vswvv7ppz2 .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /qian -c /adhesive -force-model -for-non-sphericallicensing provisions: gnu general public license v3programming language: c++nature of problem: various methods have been proposed to handle the complex shapes of non-spherical particles in the discrete element method. however, there is still a lack of effective models for calculating the contact force between the non-spherical fine particles, particularly the adhesive forces.solution method: based on the sphere-polygon algorithm and the jkr model, this program has developed a contact force model that can accurately calculate adhesive forces between non-spherical fine particles within the framework of the open source library mechsys (url: http://mechsys .nongnu .org /index .shtml).& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0164
"shame and guilt are unpleasant self-conscious emotions associated with negative evaluations of oneself or one's behavior. smith et al. (2002) demonstrated that shame and guilt are distinct and are impacted differently by public exposure, that is, the (potential) exposure to disapproving appraisals of one's misdeeds by others. the impact of public exposure (compared to no exposure) was greater for feelings of shame than for feelings of guilt. we conducted a direct replication (n = 1272) of smith et al. (2002)'s study 1 and found that exposure increased both feelings of shame (rip2 = .14, 95%, ci [.11, .17]) and guilt (rip2 = .13, 95% ci [.10, .16]) compared with the private condition. moreover, people who were in the high moral conditions reported both higher shame (rip2 = .33, 95% ci [.29, .37]) and guilt (rip2 = .36, 95% ci [.32, .39]). shame and guilt both had moderate-to-high correlations with the shame-related and guilt-related reactions and both exposure and moral belief manipulations had effects on shame-related and guilt-related reactions. our results suggest a failed replication: public exposure and moral belief influence both shame and guilt, so we cannot conclude that shame and guilt can be distinguished from each other solely based on public exposure, which diverges from the target article's main theory and findings. all materials, data, and code are available at https://osf.io/j3ue4/",AB_0164
"accurate segmentation of lesions in medical images is a key step to assist clinicians in diagnosis and analysis. most studies combine the transformer model with cnn at a single scale or use the highest-level feature tensor extracted by cnn as input to transformer without fully exploiting transformer's potential. in addition, for the problems of structural boundary blurring, heterogeneous textures, etc., in medical images, most existing methods pay attention to using contour information to solve this problem but simply fuse the contour information and ignore the potential relationship between the regions and the contours. we propose the dpctn network based on the traditional encoding-decoding structure, consisting of the cnn, transformer dual backbone networks and parallel attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate segmentation in medical image lesions. local and global multiscale feature information is extracted by cnn and transformer. the transformer block of channel cross fusion can implement multiscale information fusion of the high-level local features and reduce the impact of the redundant information. the dual backbone feature fusion module effectively couples the local and global high-level feature information. the decoder refines and enriches the boundary and regional features, layer by layer, to achieve effective supervision of the boundary and region. considering the possible dimension collapse in the attention mechanism, a novel three branch transposed self-attention module is designed to reduce the information loss caused by feature pooling. to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, subjective and objective comparative experiments and ablation experiments were performed on four medical segmentation tasks, polyps, skin lesions, glands and breast tumors. a large number of experimental results show that our method is superior to the current state-of-the-art method, reduces the standard deviation and is more robust. source code is released at https://github.com/sd-spf/dpctn.",AB_0164
"convolutional neural networks (cnns) have performed well in image denoising. although some cnns enlarge convolutional kernels and increase stacked convolutional layers to overcome the locality defect of convolutional operations, they may increase computational costs. in this paper, we propose a parallel and serial denoising network (psdnet) for image denoising to preserve image texture. specifically, the proposed psdnet contains a parallel block (pb), a serial block (sb), and a reconstruction block (rb). a pb uses two heterogeneous sub-networks with a deformable convolution in a parallel way to extract comparative information for better-recovering image texture. a sb utilizes an enhanced residual dense architecture via combinations of a batch normalization, relu, and convolutional layer in a serial way to refine obtained features for obtaining more accurate noise information. a rb is responsible for reconstructing images. experimental results reveal that our psdnet is very effective in image denoising, according to quantitative analysis and visual analysis. codes can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/psdnet.",AB_0164
"non-coding rna (ncrna) is a functional rna molecule that plays a key role in various fundamental biological processes, such as gene regulation. therefore, studying the connection between ncrna and proteins holds significant importance in exploring the function of ncrna. although many efficient and accurate methods have been developed by modern biological scientists, accurate predictions still pose a major challenge for various issues. in our approach, we utilize a multi-head attention mechanism to merge residual connections, allowing for the automatic learning of ncrna and protein sequence features. specifically, the proposed method projects node features into multiple spaces based on multi-head attention mechanism, thereby obtaining different feature interaction patterns in these spaces. by stacking interaction layers, higher-order interaction modes can be derived, while still preserving the initial feature information through the residual connection. this strategy effectively leverages the sequence information of ncrna and protein, enabling the capture of hidden high-order features. the final experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with auc values of 97.4%, 98.5%, and 94.8% achieved on the npinter v2.0, rpi807, and rpi488 datasets, respectively. these impressive results solidify our method as a powerful tool for exploring the connection between ncrnas and proteins. we have uploaded the implementation code on github: https://github.com/zzcrazy00/mham-npi.",AB_0164
"numeracy is individuals' capacity to understand and process basic probability and numerical information required to make decisions. we conducted a replication registered report of peters et al. (2006) examining numeracy as a predictor of effect (study 3), and bets effect (study 4). with an online us american amazon mechanical turk sample (n = 860), our replication using the target's dichotomizing of the numeracy measure found support for the original findings regarding interactions between numeracy and three decision-making effects. numeracy was associated with weaker framing effect (& eta;2p = 0.01, 90% ci [0.00, 0.02]), weaker ratio bias (cramer's v = 0.17, 95% ci [0.10, 0.24]), and stronger bets effect (& eta;2p = 0.02, 90% ci [0.01, 0.04]), yet we found no support for the frequency-percentage effect (& eta;2p = 0.00, 90% ci [0.00, 0.01]). however, we found support for associations with all four studies when treating numeracy as a continuous variable. we extended the replication to examine confidence, yet the results were mixed with support found for only three conditions (study 1 positive framing condition: r = -0.11, 95% ci [-0.20, -0.02]; study 3: r = 0.15, 95% ci [0.08, 0.21]; study 4 no-loss bet condition: r = 0.10, 95% ci [0.01, 0.20]), suggesting a much weaker and more complex relationship than anticipated. materials, data, and code are available on: https://osf.io/4hjck/.",AB_0164
"retinal vascular occlusion (rvo) are common causes of visual impairment. accurate recognition and differential diagnosis of rvo are unmet medical needs for determining appropriate treatments and health care to properly manage the ocular condition and minimize the damaging effects. to leverage deep learning as a potential so-lution to detect rvo reliably, we developed a deep learning model on color fundus photographs (cfps) using a two-step masked swintransformer with a few-sample generator (fsg)-auxiliary training framework (called deepdrrvo) for early and differential rvo diagnosis. the deepdrrvo was trained on the training set from the in-house cohort and achieved consistently high performance in early recognition and differential diagnosis of rvo in the validation set from the in-house cohort with an accuracy of 86.3%, and other three independent multi-center cohorts with the accuracy of 92.6%, 90.8%, and 100%. further comparative analysis showed that the proposed deepdrrvo outperforms conventional state-of-the-art classification models, such as resnet18, resnet50d, mobilenetv3, and efficientnetb1. these results highlight the potential benefits of the deep learning model in automatic early rvo detection and differential diagnosis for improving clinical outcomes and providing insights into diagnosing other ocular diseases with a few-shot learning challenge. the deepdrrvo is publicly available on https://github.com/zhousunlab-workshops/deepdrrvo.",AB_0164
"objective: predicting clinical events and providing assisted decision-making using electronic health records (ehrs) play a central role in personalized healthcare. despite the promising performance achieved for diagnosis and procedure predictions, most of the existing predictive models regard different medical codes as the same type and generally ignore the dependence between diagnoses and procedures in patients' admission history. to address these issues, we propose an end-to-end cooperative dual medical ontology representation learning framework for clinical assisted decision-making. materials and methods: the framework consists of two primary modules: (1) dual medical ontology representation learning to facilitate the learning of medical concepts and (2) task dependent multi-task prediction to capture the correlation between diagnoses and procedures in patients' admission history. we evaluate our method with ehrs from the mimic-iii clinical database, covering 6321 patients and 16335 visits. results: experiments conducted on the mimic-iii dataset show that the proposed model achieves the best performance, with a top-20 accuracy of 58.20% for diagnosis prediction and a top-20 accuracy of 75.85% for procedure prediction. in addition, a series of experimental analyses and case studies further illustrate the excellent performance of our model. conclusion: we propose an end-to-end cooperative dual medical ontology representation learning framework, which achieves superior performance on multi-task diagnosis and procedure predictions. the source code is available at https://github.com/mhxu1998/codmo.",AB_0164
"copper ion-binding proteins play an essential role in metabolic processes and are critical factors in many diseases, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and menkes disease. many algorithms have been developed for predicting metal ion classification and binding sites, but none have been applied to copper ion-binding proteins. in this study, we developed a copper ion-bound protein classifier, rpcibp, which integrating the reduced amino acid composition into position-specific scoring matrix (pssm). the reduced amino acid composition filters out a large number of useless evolutionary features, improving the operational efficiency and predictive ability of the model (feature dimension from 2900 to 200, acc from 83 % to 85.1 %). compared with the basic model using only three sequence feature extraction methods (acc in training set between 73.8 %-86.2 %, acc in test set between 69.3 %-87.5 %), the model integrating the evolutionary features of the reduced amino acid composition showed higher accuracy and robustness (acc in training set between 83.1 %-90.8 %, acc in test set between 79.1 %-91.9 %). best copper ion-binding protein classifiers filtered by feature selection progress were deployed in a user-friendly web server (http://bioinfor.imu.edu.cn/rpcibp). rpcibp can accurately predict copper ionbinding proteins, which is convenient for further structural and functional studies, and conducive to mechanism exploration and target drug development.",AB_0164
