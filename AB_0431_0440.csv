"polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) is a filler used for aesthetic and/or repair purposes. the response to the implantation of biomaterials varies according to factors related to the patient, the professional responsible for the application and the material used. in vitro and in vivo experimental models have been used to study aspects such as the organism/biomaterial interface and the role of macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. this study aimed to characterize the inflammatory reactions related to polymer concentration, implantation depth and exposure time. different concentrations of pmma were implanted in different anatomical planes in mice. the consequences of contact with pmma, from structural changes to the inflammatory characteristic of tissue damage, were histologically evaluated. the implantation interfered in the morphological structure of the region where it was implanted, expanding it and due to the inflammatory reaction generated, by the presence of the vehicle in the initial phase and by the collagen produced in the chronic phase. the 30% concentration of pmma induced a greater presence of foreign body giant cells both subcutaneously, at 7, 30 and 90 days after implantation (dai), and intramuscular at 30dai. tissue remodeling was more expressive in the subcutaneous region with significant density of the extracellular matrix at 90dai. in conclusion, the foreign body reaction resulting from the implantation process acquires different characteristics depending on the anatomical plane and the concentration of implanted product, where the more superficial the implantation plane, the greater the inflammatory reaction. moreover, pmma concentration and the depth of implantation did not influence the collagen production. no level assigned this journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each submission to which evidence-based medicine rankings are applicable. this excludes review articles, book reviews, and manuscripts that concern basic science, animal studies, cadaver studies, and experimental studies. for a full description of these evidence-based medicine ratings, please refer to the table of contents or the online instructions to authors https://www.springer.com/00266",AB_0044
"we introduce the implementation details of the simulation code cosev, which numerically solves a set of non-linear partial differential equations that govern the dynamics of neutrino collective flavor conversions. we systematically provide the details of both finite difference method supported by kreiss-oliger dissipation and finite volume method with seventh order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme. to ensure the reliability of the code, we perform comparison of the simulation results with theoretically obtainable solutions. in order to understand and characterize the error accumulation behavior of the implementations when neutrino self-interactions are switched on, we also analyze the evolution of the deviation of the conserved quantities for different values of simulation parameters. we report the performance of our code with both cpus and gpus. the public version of the cosev package is available at https://github .com /cosenu /cosenu. program summaryprogram title: cosevcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /d4dhg2sths .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /cosenu /cosenu code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /7929908 licensing provisions: bsd 3-clauseprogramming language: c++, python 3.0+supplementary material: https://cosenu .github .io /cosenu _docs/ nature of problem: collective neutrino flavor oscillations is a novel but generic phenomenon that occurs in cosmological and astrophysical environments dense in neutrinos. understanding this phenomenon requires solving the corresponding quantum kinetic transport equation, which is a set of nonlinear and hyperbolic partial differential equations.solution method: we adopt the method of lines to solve the hyperbolic partial differential equations in our program. the spatial derivatives are evaluated using either the finite difference method supported by 3rd order kreiss-oliger dissipation or the finite volume method with 7th order weno scheme. the time integration is performed using the explicit 4th order runge-kutta method. parallelization with openmp or openacc is supported.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0044
"microbial communities are massively resident in the human body, yet dysbiosis has been reported to correlate with many diseases, including various cancers. most studies focus on the gut microbiome, while the bacteria that participate in tumor microenvironments on site remain unclear. previous studies have acquired the bacteria expression profiles from rna-seq, whole genome sequencing, and whole exon sequencing in the cancer genome atlas (tcga). however, small-rna sequencing data were rarely used. using tcga mirna sequencing data, we evaluated bacterial abundance in 32 types of cancer. to uncover the bacteria involved in cancer, we applied an analytical process to align unmapped human reads to bacterial references and developed the bic database for the transcriptional landscape of bacteria in cancer. bic provides cancer-associated bacterial information, including the relative abundance of bacteria, bacterial diversity, associations with clinical relevance, the co-expression network of bacteria and human genes, and their associated biological functions. these results can complement previously published databases. users can easily download the result plots and tables, or download the bacterial abundance matrix for further analyses. in summary, bic can provide information on cancer microenvironments related to microbial communities. bic is available at: http://bic.jhlab.tw/.",AB_0044
"we established the cancer epitope database and analysis resource (cedar) to catalog all epitope data in the context of cancer. the specific molecular targets of adaptive t cell and b cell immune responses are referred to as epitopes. epitopes derived from cancer antigens are of high relevance as they are recognized by anti-cancer immune cells. detailed knowledge of the molecular characteristic of cancer epitopes and associated metadata is relevant to understanding and planning prophylactic and therapeutic applications and accurately characterizing naturally occurring immune responses and cancer immunopathology. cedar provides a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature and serves as a companion site to the immune epitope database (iedb), which is focused on infectious, autoimmune, and allergic diseases. cedar is freely accessible at https://cedar.iedb.org/.",AB_0044
"the simultaneous classification of the three most basic eye-movement patterns is known as the ternary eye-movement classification problem (3emcp). dynamic, interactive real-time applications that must instantly adjust or respond to certain eye behaviors would highly benefit from accurate, robust, fast, and low-latency classification methods. recent developments based on 1d-cnn-bilstm and tcn architectures have demonstrated to be more accurate and robust than previous solutions, but solely considering offline applications. in this paper, we propose a tcn classifier for the 3emcp, adapted to online applications, that does not require look-ahead buffers. we introduce a new lightweight preprocessing technique that allows the tcn to make real-time predictions at about 500 hz with low latency using commodity hardware. we evaluate the tcn performance against other two deep neural models: a cnn-lstm and a cnn-bilstm, also adapted to online classification. furthermore, we compare the performance of the deep neural models against a lightweight real-time bayesian classifier (i-bdt). our results, considering two publicly available datasets, show that the proposed tcn model consistently outperforms other methods for all classes. the results also show that, though it is possible to achieve reasonable accuracy levels with zero-length look ahead, the performance of all methods improve with the use of look-ahead information. the codebase, pre-trained models, and datasets are available at https://github.com/elmadjian/oemc.",AB_0044
"nuclei instance segmentation and classification in histology plays a major role in routine pathology image examination, which enable morphological features analysis that further facilitates streamlined diagnosis and prognosis quantification. however, the nuclei in the tissue images obtained from different human organs are characterized with high variability in shape, size, morphology and spatial arrangements. moreover, during digitization of tissue slide, the image quality is degraded because of added artifacts, poor contrast, blurred regions due to failed auto-focus and inconsistent staining procedure. owing to these challenges, it is difficult to build a generalized feature representation that can achieve precise segmentation and classification of nuclei instances in complex tumor micro-environment of tissue specimens obtained from various organs. to address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning model, that harnesses horizontal and vertical distance information hidden among the nuclei instances to successfully delineate the challenging nuclei. our proposed methodology uses soft attention mechanism to generate relevant feature activation and prune irrelevant and noisy information. these attention units produce more precise and refined feature maps resulting in finer instances segmentation and accurate classification in the overlapping nuclei, the nuclei with touching boundaries and reduction in false positives. we train our model on publicly available data-sets (kumar, consep, cpm-17 and a new data-set pannuke). our methodology shows superior performance in nuclei classification and segmentation in comparison with recently published methods. the code and the obtained results have been made public at the following link: http://t.ly/egkv.",AB_0044
"we assessed several agreement coefficients applied in 2x2 contingency tables, which are commonly applied in research due to dichotomization. here, we not only studied some specific estimators but also developed a general method for the study of any estimator candidate to be an agreement measurement. this method was developed in open-source r codes and it is available to the researchers. we tested this method by verifying the performance of several traditional estimators over all possible configurations with sizes ranging from 1 to 68 (total of 1,028,789 tables). cohen's kappa showed handicapped behavior similar to pearson's r, yule's q, and yule's y. scott's pi, and shankar and bangdiwala's b seem to better assess situations of disagreement than agreement between raters. krippendorff's alpha emulates, without any advantage, scott's pi in cases with nominal variables and two raters. dice's f1 and mcnemar's chi-squared incompletely assess the information of the contingency table, showing the poorest performance among all. we concluded that cohen's kappa is a measurement of association and mcnemar's chi-squared assess neither association nor agreement; the only two authentic agreement estimators are holley and guilford's g and gwet's ac1. the latter two estimators also showed the best performance over the range of table sizes and should be considered as the first choices for agreement measurement in contingency 2x2 tables. all procedures and data were implemented in r and are available to download from harvard dataverse https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/hmytck.",AB_0044

"the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the extraction socket (distal or lingual root) and the type of region of interest (roi) definition (manual or predefined) on the assessment of alveolar repair following tooth extraction using micro-computed tomography (micro-ct). the software package used for scanning, reconstruction, reorientation, and analysis of images (nrecon (r) , dataviewer (r), ct-analyzer (r)) was acquired through bruker <https://www.bruker.com>. the sample comprised the micro-ct volumes of seven wistar rat mandibles, in which the right first molar was extracted. the reconstructed images were analyzed using the extraction sockets, i.e., the distal and intermediate lingual root and the method of roi definition: manual (ma), central round (cr), and peripheral round (pr). the bone volume fraction (bv/ tv) values obtained were analyzed by two-way anova with tukey's post hoc test (alpha = 5%). the distal extraction socket resulted in significantly lower bv/tv values than the intermediate lingual socket for ma (p = 0.001), cr (p < 0.001), and pr (p < 0.001). regarding the roi, when evaluating the distal extraction socket, the bv/tv was significantly higher (p < 0.001) for ma than for cr and pr, with a lower bv/tv for cr. however, no significant difference was observed for ma (p = 0 .855), cr (p = 0 .7 69), or pr (p = 0.453) in the intermediate lingual extraction socket. the bone neoformation outcome (bv/tv) for alveolar bone repair after tooth extraction is significantly influenced by the roi and the extraction socket. using the predefined method with a standardized roi in the central region of the distal extraction socket resulted in the assessment of bone volume, demonstrating the most critical region of the bone neoformation process.",AB_0044
"conventional machine learning techniques may have lesser performance when they deal with complex data. for addressing this issue, it is important to build data mining frameworks coupled with robust knowledge discovery mechanisms. one of such frameworks, which addresses these issues is ensemble learning. it fuses data, builds models and mines data into a single framework. in spite of the work done on ensemble learning, there remain issues like how to manage the complexity, how to optimize the model, and how to fine-tune the model. natural data processing schemes use parallel processing and are robust and efficient, hence are successful. taking a cue from natural data processing architectures, we propose a parallelized cnn tree ensemble approach. the proposed approach is compared against the baseline which is the deep network used in the ensemble. the resnet50 architecture is utilized for initial experimentation. the datasets used for this task are the imagenet and natural images datasets. the proposed approach outperforms the baseline on all experiments on the imagenet dataset. further, benchmarking of the proposed approach against different types of cnns is done on various datasets including cifar-10, cifar-100, fashion-mnist, fei face recognition, and mnist digits. since our approach is adaptable for cnns, it outperforms the baseline cnns as well as the state-of-the-art techniques on these datasets. the cnns architectures used for benchmarking are resnet-50, densenet, wrn-28-10 and nsganetv1. the code for the paper is available in https://github.com/mueedhafiz1982/cnntreeensemble.git.",AB_0044
