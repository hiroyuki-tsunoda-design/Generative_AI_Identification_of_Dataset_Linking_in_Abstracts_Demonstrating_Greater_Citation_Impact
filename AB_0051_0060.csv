"motivation: over 300 000 protein-protein interaction (ppi) pairs have been identified in the human proteome and targeting these is fast becoming the next frontier in drug design. predicting ppi sites, however, is a challenging task that traditionally requires computationally expensive and time-consuming docking simulations. a major weakness of modern protein docking algorithms is the inability to account for protein flexibility, which ultimately leads to relatively poor results.results: here, we propose docknet, an efficient siamese graph-based neural network method which predicts con-tact residues between two interacting proteins. unlike other methods that only utilize a protein's surface or treat the protein structure as a rigid body, docknet incorporates the entire protein structure and places no limits on protein flexibility during an interaction. predictions are modeled at the residue level, based on a diverse set of input node features including residue type, surface accessibility, residue depth, secondary structure, pharmacophore and torsional angles. docknet is comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an area under the curve (auc) value of up to 0.84 on an independent test set (db5), can be applied to a variety of different protein structures and can be utilized in situations where accurate unbound protein structures cannot be obtained.availability and implementation: docknet is available at https://github.com/npwilliams09/docknet and an easy-to-use webserver at https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/docknet. all other data underlying this article are available in the article and in its online supplementary material.",AB_0006
"aims: themis is a double-blind, randomized trial of 19,220 patients with diabetes mellitus and stable coronary artery disease (cad) comparing ticagrelor to placebo, in addition to aspirin. the present study aimed to describe the proportion of patients eligible and reasons for ineligibility for themis within a population of patients with diabetes and cad included in the reduction of atherothrombosis for continued health (reach) registry.methods and results: the themis eligibility criteria were applied to reach patients. themis included patients >= 50 years with type 2 diabetes and stable cad as determined by either a history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or documentation of angiographic stenosis of >= 50% of at least one coronary artery. patients with prior myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded. in reach, 10,156 patients had stable cad and diabetes. of these, 6515 (64.1%) patients had at least one exclusion criteria. from the remaining population, 784 patients did not meet inclusion criteria (7.7%) mainly due to absence of aspirin treatment (7.2%), yielding a 'themis-eligible population' of 2857 patients (28.1% of patients with diabetes and stable cad). the main reasons for exclusion were a history of myocardial infarction (53.1%), use of oral anti-coagulation (14.5%), or history of stroke (12.9%). among the 4208 patients with diabetes and a previous pci, 1196 patients (28.4%) were eligible for inclusion in the themis-pci substudy.conclusions: in a population of patients with diabetes and stable coronary artery disease, a sizeable proportion appear to be 'themis eligible.'clinical trial registration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01991795",AB_0006
"alternative splicing (as) is an important mechanism in the development of many cancers, as novel or aberrant as patterns play an important role as an independent onco-driver. in addition, cancer-specific as is potentially an effective target of personalized cancer therapeutics. however, detecting as events remains a challenging task, especially if these as events are novel. this is exacerbated by the fact that existing transcriptome annotation databases are far from being comprehensive, especially with regard to cancer-specific as. additionally, traditional sequencing technologies are severely limited by the short length of the generated reads, which rarely spans more than a single splice junction site. given these challenges, transcriptomic long-read (lr) sequencing presents a promising potential for the detection and discovery of as. we present freddie, a computational annotation-independent isoform discovery and detection tool. freddie takes as input transcriptomic lr sequencing of a sample alongside its genomic split alignment and computes a set of isoforms for the given sample. it then partitions the input reads into sets that can be processed independently and in parallel. for each partition, freddie segments the genomic alignment of the reads into canonical exon segments. the goal of this segmentation is to be able to represent any potential isoform as a subset of these canonical exons. this segmentation is formulated as an optimization problem and is solved with a dynamic programming algorithm. then, freddie reconstructs the isoforms by jointly clustering and error-correcting the reads using the canonical segmentation as a succinct representation. the clustering and error-correcting step is formulated as an optimization problem-the minimum error clustering into isoforms (merci) problem-and is solved using integer linear programming (ilp). we compare the performance of freddie on simulated datasets with other isoform detection tools with varying dependence on annotation databases. we show that freddie outperforms the other tools in its accuracy, including those given the complete ground truth annotation. we also run freddie on a transcriptomic lr dataset generated in-house from a prostate cancer cell line with a matched short-read rna-seq dataset. freddie results in isoforms with a higher short-read cross-validation rate than the other tested tools. freddie is open source and available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/freddie/.",AB_0006
"in this work, we report the set-up and results of the liver tumor segmentation benchmark (lits), which was organized in conjunction with the ieee international symposium on biomedical imaging (isbi) 2017 and the international conferences on medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention (miccai) 2017 and 2018. the image dataset is diverse and contains primary and secondary tumors with varied sizes and appearances with various lesion-to-background levels (hyper-/hypo-dense), created in collaboration with seven hospitals and research institutions. seventy-five submitted liver and liver tumor segmentation algorithms were trained on a set of 131 computed tomography (ct) volumes and were tested on 70 unseen test images acquired from different patients. we found that not a single algorithm performed best for both liver and liver tumors in the three events. the best liver segmentation algorithm achieved a dice score of 0.963, whereas, for tumor segmentation, the best algorithms achieved dices scores of 0.674 (isbi 2017), 0.702 (miccai 2017), and 0.739 (miccai 2018). retrospectively, we performed additional analysis on liver tumor detection and revealed that not all top-performing segmentation algorithms worked well for tumor detection. the best liver tumor detection method achieved a lesion-wise recall of 0.458 (isbi 2017), 0.515 (miccai 2017), and 0.554 (miccai 2018), indicating the need for further research. lits remains an active benchmark and resource for research, e.g., contributing the liver-related segmentation tasks in http://medicaldecathlon.com/. in addition, both data and online evaluation are accessible via https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094.",AB_0006
"bone age assessment plays a significant role in estimating bone maturity. however, radiograph/x-ray images of hand bones contain a large amount of redundant information. some detection or segmentation based methods have recently been proposed to solve this issue. these network structures are often of high complexity and might require extra annotations, which make them less applicable in practice. in this paper, we present a multi-scale multi-reception attention net (mmanet), which combines a novel multi-scale multi-reception complement attention (mmca) network and a graph attention module with a resnet backbone to enhance the feature representation of key regions and suppress the influence of background regions to achieve significant performance improvement. experimental results show our mmanet is able to accurately detect key regions and achieves 3.88 mean absolute error (mae) on the rsna 2017 paediatric bone age challenge dataset. our method, without explicit modelling of anatomical information, outperforms the current state-of-the-art method (mae=3.91) by 0.03 (months) which requires extra annotations. code is available at https://github.com/ yzc1122333/boneageass.(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0006
"despite the arsenal of existing cancer therapies, the ongoing recurrence and new cases of cancer pose a serious health concern that necessitates the development of new and effective treatments. cancer immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to combat cancer, is a promising treatment option. as a result, in silico methods for identifying and characterizing tumor t cell antigens (ttcas) would be useful for better understanding their functional mechanisms. although few computational methods for ttca identification have been developed, their lack of model interpretability is a major drawback. thus, developing computational methods for the effective identification and characterization of ttcas is a critical endeavor. psrttca, a new machine learning (ml)-based approach for improving the identification and characterization of ttcas based on their primary sequences, is proposed in this study. specifically, we introduce a new propensity score representation learning algorithm that allows one to generate various sets of propensity scores of amino acids, dipeptides, and ggap dipeptides to be ttcas. to enhance the predictive performance, optimal sets of variant propensity scores were determined and fed into the final meta-predictor (psrttca). benchmarking results revealed that psrttca was a more precise and promising tool for the identification and characterization of ttcas than conventional ml classifiers and existing methods. furthermore, psr-derived propensities of amino acids in becoming ttcas are used to reveal the relationship between ttcas and their informative physicochemical properties in order to provide insights into ttca characteristics. finally, a user-friendly online computational platform of psrttca is publicly available at http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/psrttca. the psrttca predictor is anticipated to facilitate community-wide efforts in accelerating the discovery of novel ttcas for cancer immunotherapy and other clinical applications.",AB_0006
"skin cancer is one of the most common types of malignancy, affecting a large population and causing a heavy economic burden worldwide. over the last few years, computer-aided diagnosis has been rapidly developed and make great progress in healthcare and medical practices due to the advances in artificial intelligence, particularly with the adoption of convolutional neural networks. however, most studies in skin cancer detection keep pursuing high prediction accuracies without considering the limitation of computing resources on portable devices. in this case, the knowledge distillation (kd) method has been proven as an efficient tool to help improve the adaptability of lightweight models under limited resources, meanwhile keeping a high-level representation capability. to bridge the gap, this study specifically proposes a novel method, termed ssd-kd, that unifies diverse knowledge into a generic kd framework for skin disease classification. our method models an intra-instance relational feature representation and integrates it with existing kd research. a dual relational knowledge distillation architecture is self-supervised trained while the weighted softened outputs are also exploited to enable the student model to capture richer knowledge from the teacher model. to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on isic 2019, a large-scale open-accessed benchmark of skin diseases dermoscopic images. experiments show that our distilled mobilenetv2 can achieve an accuracy as high as 85% for the classification tasks of 8 different skin diseases with minimal parameters and computing requirements. ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our intra-and inter-instance relational knowledge integration strategy. compared with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques, the proposed method demonstrates improved performance. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep knowledge distillation application for multi-disease classification on the large-scale dermoscopy database. our codes and models are available at https://github.com/enkiwang/portable-skin-lesion-diagnosis.",AB_0006
"we present the fluid transport accelerated solver, flutas, a scalable gpu code for multiphase flows with thermal effects. the code solves the incompressible navier-stokes equation for two-fluid systems, with a direct fft-based poisson solver for the pressure equation. the interface between the two fluids is represented with the volume of fluid (vof) method, which is mass conserving and well suited for complex flows thanks to its capacity of handling topological changes. the energy equation is explicitly solved and coupled with the momentum equation through the boussinesq approximation. the code is conceived in a modular fashion so that different numerical methods can be used independently, the existing routines can be modified, and new ones can be included in a straightforward and sustainable manner. flutas is written in modern fortran and parallelized using hybrid mpi/openmp in the cpu -only version and accelerated with openacc directives in the gpu implementation. we present different benchmarks to validate the code, and two large-scale simulations of fundamental interest in turbulent multiphase flows: isothermal emulsions in hit and two-layer rayleigh-benard convection. flutas is distributed through a mit license and arises from a collaborative effort of several scientists, aiming to become a flexible tool to study complex multiphase flows. program summary program title:: fluid transport accelerated solver, flutas. cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /tp6k8wky8m .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /multiphysics -flow-solvers /flutas .git. licensing provisions: mit license. programming language: fortran 90, parallelized using mpi and slab/pencil decomposition, gpu accelerated using openacc directives. external libraries/routines: fftw, cufft. nature of problem: flutas is a gpu-accelerated numerical code tailored to perform interface resolved simulations of incompressible multiphase flows, optionally with heat transfer. the code combines a standard pressure correction algorithm with an algebraic volume of fluid method, mthinc [1].solution method: the code employs a second-order-finite difference discretization and solves the two -fluid navier-stokes equation using a projection method. it can be run both on cpu-architectures and gpu-architectures. & copy; 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0006
"over the past several years, video captioning has received much attention in computer vision and ma-chine learning communities. many models utilize an rnn-based decoder to generate sentences describing the content of a video. they have achieved much progress; however, few methods adopt a decoder with more than three layers because an rnn-based model with more layers may become hard to train, time-consuming or even deteriorate at a certain depth. to address the limitation, we propose a multi-layer memory sharing network, mesnet for short, which allows more layers to be stacked without compro-mising performance. in mesnet, we construct a novel memory sharing structure to strengthen the con-nections between layers and make the model easier to train. more specifically, we design an enhanced gated recurrent unit (en-gru) and stack it to construct a deeper network. unlike traditional rnn-based multi-layer networks, the memory states of all layers in mesnet are cross-used at each iteration to mimic the brain's complex connections. extensive experiments on msvd and msr-vtt demonstrate that our method performs well and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods significantly. our code is available at https://github.com/nbbb/mesnet .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0006
"network embedding, a central issue of deep learning preprocessing on social networks, aims to transform network elements (vertices) into low-dimensional latent vector space while preserving the topology and properties of the network. however, most of the existing methods mainly focus on static networks, neglecting the dynamic characteristics of real social networks. the explanation for the fundamental dynamic mechanism of social network evolution is still lacking. we design a novel dynamic network embedding approach preserving both triadic closure evolution and community structures (dnetc). first, three factors, the popularity of vertices, the proximity of vertices, and the community structures, are incorporated relying on the triadic closure principle in social networks. second, the triadic closure loss function, the community loss function, and the temporal smoothness loss function are constructed and incorporated to optimize dnetc. finally, the low-dimensional cognition presentation of a dynamic social network can be achieved, which can save both the evolution patterns of microscopic vertices and the structure information of macroscopic communities. experiments on the classical tasks of link prediction, link reconstruction, and changed link reconstruction and prediction demonstrate the superiority of dnetc over state-of-the-art methods. the first experimental results validate the effectiveness of adopting triadic closure progress and community structures to improve the quality of the learned low-dimensional vectors. the last experimental results further verify the parameter sensitivity of dnetc to the analysis task. it provides a new idea for dynamic network embedding to reflect the real evolution characteristics of networks and enhance the effect of network analysis tasks. the code is available at https://github.com/yangmin-10/dnetc.",AB_0006
