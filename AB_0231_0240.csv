"automatic polyp segmentation from colonoscopy videos is a prerequisite for the development of a computer-assisted colon cancer examination and diagnosis system. however, it remains a very challenging task owing to the large variation of polyps, the low contrast between polyps and background, and the blurring boundaries of polyps. more importantly, real-time performance is a necessity of this task, as it is anticipated that the segmented results can be immediately presented to the doctor during the colonoscopy intervention for his/her prompt decision and action. it is difficult to develop a model with powerful representation capability, yielding satisfactory segmentation results and, simultaneously, maintaining real-time performance. in this article, we present a novel lightweight context-aware network, namely, polypseg+, attempting to capture distinguishable features of polyps without increasing network complexity and sacrificing time performance. to achieve this, a set of novel lightweight techniques is developed and integrated into the proposed polypseg+, including an adaptive scale context (asc) module equipped with a lightweight attention mechanism to tackle the large-scale variation of polyps, an efficient global context (egc) module to promote the fusion of low-level and high-level features by excluding background noise and preserving boundary details, and a lightweight feature pyramid fusion (fpf) module to further refine the features extracted from the asc and egc. we extensively evaluate the proposed polypseg+ on two famous public available datasets for the polyp segmentation task: 1) kvasir-seg and 2) cvc-endoscenestill. the experimental results demonstrate that our polypseg+ consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art networks by achieving better segmentation accuracy in much less running time. the code is available at https://github.com/szu-zzb/polypsegplus.",AB_0024
"salient object detection (sod) in optical remote sensing images (rsis), or rsi-sod, is an emerging topic in understanding optical rsis. however, due to the difference between optical rsis and natural scene images (nsis), directly applying nsi-sod methods to optical rsis fails to achieve satisfactory results. in this article, we propose a novel adjacent context coordination network (acconet) to explore the coordination of adjacent features in an encoder-decoder architecture for rsi-sod. specifically, acconet consists of three parts: 1) an encoder; 2) adjacent context coordination modules (accoms); and 3) a decoder. as the key component of acconet, accom activates the salient regions of output features of the encoder and transmits them to the decoder. accom contains a local branch and two adjacent branches to coordinate the multilevel features simultaneously. the local branch highlights the salient regions in an adaptive way, while the adjacent branches introduce global information of adjacent levels to enhance salient regions. in addition, to extend the capabilities of the classic decoder block (i.e., several cascaded convolutional layers), we extend it with two bifurcations and propose a bifurcation-aggregation block (bab) to capture the contextual information in the decoder. extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed acconet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art methods under nine evaluation metrics, and runs up to 81 fps on a single nvidia titan x gpu. the code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/mathlee/acconet.",AB_0024
"during online social networks (osns), popularity prediction uncovers the final size of online content based on the observed cascade, which has been the critical technology for online recommendation, viral marketing, and rumor detection. recently, representation learning could help to infer the mapping between the dynamic cascade and the final popularity efficiently, and has been a new research paradigm for popularity prediction. however, those methods are vulnerable to structure disturbance when lack of fine-grained supervision, as only the dynamic cascade is used. therefore, we propose a novel trend and cascade based spatiotemporal evolution network (tcse-net), which preserves the distinguishable structure pattern while eliminating potential noise, via aligning and fusing the temporal popularity and cascade. to be specific, we first leveraged the long-short term memory (lstm) and recurrent graph convolutional network (gcn) to learn the trend representation and the corresponding cascade representation respectively. meanwhile, we represent node with it's layer, thereby the hierarchy is preserved in cascade representation through gcn. then, both trend and cascade representations are aligned in time sequence and selectively assembled by a set of shared parameters for popularity prediction. the extensive experimental results show that our tcse-net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real datasets. related code will be publicly available on https://github.com/tan-openlab/tcse-net.",AB_0024
"graph neural network (gnn) has achieved great success on graph representation learning. challenged by large-scale private data collected from user side, gnn may not be able to reflect the excellent performance, without rich features and complete adjacent relationships. addressing the problem, vertical federated learning (vfl) is proposed to implement local data protection through training a global model collaboratively. consequently, for graph-structured data, it is a natural idea to construct a gnn-based vfl (gvfl) framework. however, gnn has been proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks. whether the vulnerability will be brought into the gvfl has not been studied. this is the first study of adversarial attacks on gvfl. a novel adversarial attack method is proposed, named graph-fraudster. it generates adversarial perturbations based on the noise-added global node embeddings via the privacy leakage and the gradient of pairwise node. specifically, first, graph-fraudster steals the global node embeddings and sets up a shadow model of the server for the attack generator. second, noise is added into node embeddings to confuse the shadow model. finally, the gradient of pairwise node is used to generate attacks with the guidance of noise-added node embeddings. extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that graph-fraudster achieves the state-of-the-art attack performance compared with baselines in different gnn based gvfls. furthermore, graph-fraudster can remain a threat to gvfl even if two possible defense mechanisms are applied. in addition, some suggestions are put forward for the future work to improve the robustness of gvfl. the code and datasets can be downloaded at https://github.com/hgh0545/graph-fraudster.",AB_0024
"in this work, a novel semisupervised framework is proposed to tackle the small-sample problem of dental-based human identification (dhi), achieving enhanced performance via a ``classifying while generating'' paradigm. a generative adversarial network (gan), called the dhi-gan, is presented to implement this idea, in which an extra classifier is also dedicatedly proposed to achieve an efficient training procedure. considering the complex specificities of this problem, except for the noise input of the generator, an identity embedding-guided architecture is proposed to retain informative features for each individual. a parallel spatial and channel fusion attention block is innovatively designed to encourage the model to learn discriminative and informative features by focusing on different regional details and abstract concepts. the attention block is also widely applied to the overall classifier to learn identity-dependent information. a loss combination of the arcface and focal loss is utilized to address the small-sample problem. two parameters are proposed to control the generated samples that are fed into the classifier during the optimization procedure. the proposed dhi-gan framework is finally validated on a real-world dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms other baselines, achieving a 92.5% top-one accuracy rate. most importantly, the proposed gan-based semisupervised training strategy is able to reduce the required number of training samples (individuals) and can also be incorporated into other classification models. our code will be available at https://github.com/sculyi/medicalimages/.",AB_0024
"an echo state network (esn) draws widespread attention and is applied in many scenarios. as the most typical approach for solving the esn, the matrix inverse operation of high computational complexity is involved. however, in the modern big data era, addressing the heavy computational burden problem is necessary. in order to reduce the computational load, an inverse-free esn (ifesn) is proposed for the first time in this article. besides, an incremental ifesn is constructed to attain the network topology with theoretical proof on the training error's monotone decline property. simulations and experiments are conducted on several numerical and real-world time-series benchmarks, and corresponding results indicate that the proposed model is superior to some existing models and possesses excellent practical application potential. the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/longjin-lab/the-supplementary-file-for-cyb-e-2021-04-0944.",AB_0024
"this article focuses on filter-level network pruning. a novel pruning method, termed clr-rnf, is proposed. we first reveal a ``long-tail'' pruning problem in magnitude-based weight pruning methods and then propose a computation-aware measurement for individual weight importance, followed by a cross-layer ranking (clr) of weights to identify and remove the bottom-ranked weights. consequently, the per-layer sparsity makes up the pruned network structure in our filter pruning. then, we introduce a recommendation-based filter selection scheme where each filter recommends a group of its closest filters. to pick the preserved filters from these recommended groups, we further devise a k-reciprocal nearest filter (rnf) selection scheme where the selected filters fall into the intersection of these recommended groups. both our pruned network structure and the filter selection are nonlearning processes, which, thus, significantly reduces the pruning complexity and differentiates our method from existing works. we conduct image classification on cifar-10 and imagenet to demonstrate the superiority of our clr-rnf over the state-of-the-arts. for example, on cifar-10, clr-rnf removes 74.1% flops and 95.0% parameters from vggnet-16 with even 0.3% accuracy improvements. on imagenet, it removes 70.2% flops and 64.8% parameters from resnet-50 with only 1.7% top-five accuracy drops. our project is available at https://github.com/lmbxmu/clr-rnf.",AB_0024
"pansharpening refers to the fusion of a panchromatic (pan) image with a high spatial resolution and a multispectral (ms) image with a low spatial resolution, aiming to obtain a high spatial resolution ms (hrms) image. in this article, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture with level-domain-based loss function for pansharpening by taking into account the following double-type structures, i.e., double-level, double-branch, and double-direction, called as triple-double network (tdnet). by using the structure of tdnet, the spatial details of the pan image can be fully exploited and utilized to progressively inject into the low spatial resolution ms (lrms) image, thus yielding the high spatial resolution output. the specific network design is motivated by the physical formula of the traditional multi-resolution analysis (mra) methods. hence, an effective mra fusion module is also integrated into the tdnet. besides, we adopt a few resnet blocks and some multi-scale convolution kernels to deepen and widen the network to effectively enhance the feature extraction and the robustness of the proposed tdnet. extensive experiments on reduced- and full-resolution datasets acquired by worldview-3, quickbird, and gaofen-2 sensors demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tdnet compared with some recent state-of-the-art pansharpening approaches. an ablation study has also corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. the code is available at https://github.com/liangjiandeng/tdnet.",AB_0024
"graph convolution networks (gcns), with their efficient ability to capture high-order connectivity in graphs, have been widely applied in recommender systems. stacking multiple neighbor aggregation is the major operation in gcns. it implicitly captures popularity features because the number of neighbor nodes reflects the popularity of a node. however, existing gcn-based methods ignore a universal problem: users' sensitivity to item popularity is differentiated, but the neighbor aggregations in gcns actually fix this sensitivity through graph laplacian normalization, leading to suboptimal personalization. in this work, we propose to model multigrained popularity features and jointly learn them together with high-order connectivity to match the differentiation of user preferences exhibited in popularity features. specifically, we develop a joint multigrained popularity-aware graph convolution collaborative filtering model, short for jmp-gcf, which uses a popularity-aware embedding generation to construct multigrained popularity features and uses the idea of joint learning to capture the signals within and between different granularities of popularity features that are relevant for modeling user preferences. in addition, we propose a multistage stacked training strategy to speed up model convergence. we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to show the state-of-the-art performance of jmp-gcf. the complete codes of jmp-gcf are released at https://github.com/kangliu1225/jmp-gcf.",AB_0024
"existing online knowledge distillation approaches either adopt the student with the best performance or construct an ensemble model for better holistic performance. however, the former strategy ignores other students' information, while the latter increases the computational complexity during deployment. in this article, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed feature fusion and self-distillation (ffsd), which comprises two key components: ffsd, toward solving the above problems in a unified framework. different from previous works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed ffsd splits them into a leader student set and a common student set. then, the feature fusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common students into a fused feature map. the fused representation is used to assist the learning of the leader student. to enable the leader student to absorb more diverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the diversity among students. besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to convert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. then, the shallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the deeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. after training, we simply adopt the leader student, which achieves superior performance, over the common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost. extensive experiments on cifar-100 and imagenet demonstrate the superiority of our ffsd over existing works. the code is available at https://github.com/sjleo/ffsd.",AB_0024
