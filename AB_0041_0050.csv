"visual object tracking has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. however, current research in the vision community mainly focuses on tracking of generic objects, while less attention is paid to tracking unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) especially from a moving platform. in this work, we explore this problem by constructing a uav to uav (uav2uav) tracking dataset. specifically, this dataset consists of 44 videos (23k frames). each video is manually annotated with bounding boxes. to the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first work dedicated to uav2uav tracking. we extensively evaluate 19 state-of-the-art trackers using both hand-crafted feature based and deep-learning based approaches to understand how existing tracking methods perform and to provide a baseline for future works. the evaluation results show that more research works are needed to improve uav2uav tracking. in addition, we introduce a novel tracker, which leverages data augmentation technique for uav tracking to encourage future research. by releasing this dataset, we expect to facilitate future studies and applications of uav2uav tracking in both academia and industry communities. our dataset is available at: https://github.com/hapless19/uav2uav-dataset.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0005
"determining the pathogenicity and functional impact (i.e. gain -of-function; gof or loss -of-function; lof) of a variant is vital for unraveling the genetic level mechanisms of human diseases. to provide a 'one -stop' framework for the accurate identification of pathogenicity and functional impact of variants, we developed a two -stage deep -learning-based computational solution, termed vpatho, which was trained using a total of 9619 pathogenic gof/lof and 138 026 neutral variants curated from various databases. a total number of 138 variant -level, 262 protein -level and 103 genome-level features were extracted for constructing the models of vpatho. the development of vpatho consists of two stages: (i) a random under-sampling multi -scale residual neural network (resnet) with a newly defined weighted -loss function (rus-wg-msresnet) was proposed to predict variants' pathogenicity on the gnomad_nv +gof/lof dataset; and (ii) an xgbod model was constructed to predict the functional impact of the given variants. benchmarking experiments demonstrated that rus-wg-msresnet achieved the highest prediction performance with the weights calculated based on the ratios of neutral versus pathogenic variants. independent tests showed that both rus-wg-msresnet and xgbod achieved outstanding performance. moreover, assessed using variants from the cagi6 competition, rus-wg-msresnet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art predictors. the fine -trained xgbod models were further used to blind test the whole lof data downloaded from gnomad and accordingly, we identified 31 nonlof variants that were previously labeled as lof/uncertain variants. as an implementation of the developed approach, a webserver of vpatho is made publicly available at http://csbianjustedu.cn/ bioinfivpathoi to facilitate community -wide efforts for profiling and prioritizing the query variants with respect to their pathogenicity and functional impact.",AB_0005
"recently few-shot object detection (fsod) in remote sensing images (rsis) has drawn increasing attention. however, the current fsod methods in rsis merely focus on the detection performance of few-shot novel classes while ignoring the severe degradation of the base class performance. generalized few-shot object detection (g-fsod) aims to solve the fsod problem without forgetting previous knowledge. in this paper, we focus on the g-fsod in rsis and propose a generalized few-shot detector (g-fsdet) that can learn novel knowledge without forgetting. through the comprehensive analysis of each component in the detector, a novel efficient transfer-learning framework is presented as the foundation of our g-fsdet, which is more suitable for fsod in remote sensing scenes. considering the greater intra-class diversity and lower inter-class separability of geospatial objects, we design a metric-based discriminative loss to learn a more discriminative classifier in the few-shot fine-tuning stage. furthermore, a representation compensation module is proposed to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem by decoupling the representation learning of previous and novel knowledge. extensive experiments on dior and nwpu vhr-10.v2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed g-fsdet achieves competitive novel class performance with minor degradation in the base class, reaching state-of-the-art overall performance among all few-shot settings. the source code is available at (https://github.com/rser-xdu/g-fsdet).",AB_0005
"recently, many metaheuristic optimization algorithms have been developed to address real-world issues. in this study, a new physics-based metaheuristic called fick's law optimization (fla) is presented, in which fick's first rule of diffusion is utilized. according to fick's law of diffusion, molecules tend to diffuse from higher to lower concentration areas. many experimental series are done to test fla's performance and ability in solving different optimization problems. firstly, fla is tested using twenty well-known benchmark functions and thirty cec2017 test functions. secondly, five real-world engineering problems are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed fla. the findings are compared with 12 well-known and powerful optimizers. a wilcoxon rank-sum test is carried out to evaluate the comparable statistical performance of competing algorithms. results prove that fla achieves competitive and promising findings, a good convergence curve rate, and a good balance between exploration and exploitation. the source code is currently available for public from: https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/121033-fick-s-law-algorithm-fla.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0005
"automatic analysis of bioacoustic signals is a fundamental tool to evaluate the vitality of our planet. frogs and bees, for instance, may act like biological sensors providing information about environmental changes. this task is fundamental for ecological monitoring and includes many challenges, such as nonuniform signal length processing, degraded target signal due to environmental noise, and the scarcity of labeled samples for training machine learning systems. to tackle these challenges, we present a bioacoustic signal classifier equipped with a discriminative mechanism to extract useful features for analysis and classification efficiently. the proposed classifier does not require a large amount of training data and handles nonuniform signal length natively. unlike current bioacoustic recognition methods, which are task-oriented, the proposed model relies on transforming the input signals into vector subspaces generated by applying singular spectrum analysis (ssa). then, a subspace is designed to expose discriminative features. the proposed model shares end-to-end capabilities, which are desirable in modern machine learning systems. this formulation provides a segmentation-free and noise-tolerant approach to represent and classify bioacoustic signals and a highly compact signal descriptor inherited from ssa. the validity of the proposed method is verified using three challenging bioacoustic datasets containing anuran, bee, and mosquito species. experimental results on three bioacoustic datasets have shown the competitive performance of the proposed method compared to commonly employed methods for bioacoustics signal classification in terms of accuracy. the code developed for this research can be found in the following repository: http://github .com /bernardo -gatto /dssc.(c) 2022 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0005
"background & aims: binge drinking in patients with metabolic syndrome accelerates the development of alcohol-associated liver disease. however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. we investigated if oxidative and nonoxidative alcohol metabolism pathways, diet-induced obesity, and adi-pose tissues influenced the development of acute liver injury in a single ethanol binge model. methods: a single ethanol binge was administered to chow-fed or high-fat diet (hfd)-fed wild-type and genetically modified mice.results: oral administration of a single dose of ethanol induced acute liver injury and hepatic endoplasmic reticu-lum (er) stress in chow-or hfd-fed mice. disruption of the adh1 gene increased blood ethanol concentration and exacerbated acute ethanol-induced er stress and liver injury in both chow-fed and hfd-fed mice, while disruption of the aldh2 gene did not affect such hepatic injury despite high blood acetaldehyde levels. mechanistic studies showed that alcohol, not acetaldehyde, promoted hepatic er stress, fatty acid synthesis, and increased adipocyte death and lipolysis, contributing to acute liver injury. increased serum fatty acid ethyl esters (faees), which are formed by an enzyme-mediated esterification of ethanol with fatty acids, were detected in mice after ethanol gavage, with higher levels in adh1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice. deletion of the ces1d gene in mice markedly reduced the acute ethanol-induced increase of blood faee levels with a slight but significant reduction of serum aminotransferase levels.conclusions: ethanol and its nonoxidative metabolites, faees, not acetaldehyde, promoted acute alcohol-induced liver injury by inducing er stress, adipocyte death, and lipolysis.

"biological networks are often used to represent complex biological systems, which can contain several types of entities. analysis and visualization of such networks is supported by the cytoscape software tool and its many apps. while earlier versions of stringapp focused on providing intraspecies protein-protein interactions from the string database, the new stringapp 2.0 greatly improves the support for heterogeneous networks. here, we highlight new functionality that makes it possible to create networks that contain proteins and interactions from string as well as other biological entities and associations from other sources. we exemplify this by complementing a published sars-cov-2 interactome with interactions from string. we have also extended stringapp with new data and query functionality for protein-protein interactions between eukaryotic parasites and their hosts. we show how this can be used to retrieve and visualize a cross-species network for a malaria parasite, its host, and its vector. finally, the latest stringapp version has an improved user interface, allows retrieval of both functional associations and physical interactions, and supports group-wise enrichment analysis of different parts of a network to aid biological interpretation. stringapp is freely available at https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp.",AB_0005
"motivation since early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has confronted the biomedical community with an unprecedented challenge. the rapid spread of covid-19 and ease of transmission seen worldwide is due to increased population flow and international trade. front-line medical care, treatment research and vaccine development also require rapid and informative interpretation of the literature and covid-19 data produced around the world, with 177 500 papers published between january 2020 and november 2021, i.e. almost 8500 papers per month. to extract knowledge and enable interoperability across resources, we developed the covid-19 vocabulary (covoc), an application ontology related to the research on this pandemic. the main objective of covoc development was to enable seamless navigation from biomedical literature to core databases and tools of elixir, a european-wide intergovernmental organization for life sciences. results this collaborative work provided data integration into sib literature services, an application ontology (covoc) and a triage service named covtriage and based on annotation processing to search for covid-related information across pre-defined aspects with daily updates. thanks to its interoperability potential, covoc lends itself to wider applications, hopefully through further connections with other novel covid-19 ontologies as has been established with coronavirus infectious disease ontology. availability and implementation the data at https://github.com/ebispot/covoc and the service at https://candy.hesge.ch/covtriage.",AB_0005
"four moderate-complexity automated nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis are reported as having laboratory analytical and clinical performance similar to that of the cepheid xpert mtb/rif assay. these assays are the abbott realtime mtb and realtime mtb rif/inh resistance, becton dickinson max mdr-tb, the hain lifescience/bruker fluorotype mtbdr, and the roche cobas mtb and mtb rif/inh assays. the study compared feasibility, ease of use, and operational charac-teristics of these assays/platforms. manufacturer input was obtained for technical characteristics. laboratory operators were requested to complete a questionnaire on the assays' ease of use. a time-in -motion analysis was also undertaken for each platform. for ease-of-use and operational requirements, the bd max mdr-tb assay achieved the highest scores (86% and 90%) based on information provided by the user and manufacturer, respectively, followed by the cobas mtb and mtb-rif/inh assay (68% and 86%), the fluorotype mtbdr assay (67% and 80%), and the abbott rt-mtb and rt mtb rif/inh assays (64% and 76%). the time-in-motion analysis revealed that for 94 specimens, the realtime mtb assay required the longest processing time, followed by the cobas mtb assay and the fluorotype mtbdr assay. the bd max mdr-tb assay required 4.6 hours for 22 specimens. these diagnostic assays exhibited different strengths and weaknesses that should be taken into account, in addition to affordability, when considering placement of a new platform.

"periodontitis is a serious oral disease that can lead to severe conditions such as bone loss and teeth falling out if left untreated. diagnosis of radiographic bone loss (rbl) is critical for the staging and treatment of periodontitis. unfortunately, the rbl diagnosis by examining the panoramic radiographs is time-consuming. the demand for automated image analysis is urgent. however, existing deep learning methods have limited performances in diagnosis accuracy and have certain difficulties in implementation. hence, we propose a novel two-stage periodontitis detection convolutional neural network (pdcnn), where we optimize the detector with an anchor-free encoding that allows fast and accurate prediction. we also introduce a proposal -connection module in our detector that excludes less relevant regions of interests (rois), making the network focus on more relevant rois to improve detection accuracy. furthermore, we introduced a large-scale, high -resolution panoramic radiograph dataset that captures various complex cases with professional periodontitis annotations. experiments on our panoramic-image dataset show that the proposed approach achieved an rbl classification accuracy of 0.762. this result shows that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art detectors such as faster r-cnn and yolo-v4. we can conclude that the proposed method successfully improves the rbl detection performance. the dataset and our code have been released on github.
