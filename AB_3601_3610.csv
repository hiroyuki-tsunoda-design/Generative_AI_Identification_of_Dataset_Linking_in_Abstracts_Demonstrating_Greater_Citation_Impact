"temporal action detection (tad) is extensively studied in the video understanding community by generally following the object detection pipeline in images. however, complex designs are not uncommon in tad, such as two-stream feature extraction, multi-stage training, complex temporal modeling, and global context fusion. in this paper, we do not aim to introduce any novel technique for tad. instead, we study a simple, straightforward, yet must-known baseline given the current status of complex design and low detection efficiency in tad. in our simple baseline (basictad), we decompose the tad pipeline into several essential components: data sampling, backbone design, neck construction, and detection head. we extensively investigate the existing techniques in each component for this baseline and, more importantly, perform end-to -end training over the entire pipeline thanks to the simplicity of design. as a result, this simple basictad yields an astounding and real-time rgb-only baseline very close to the state-of-the-art methods with two-stream inputs. in addition, we further improve the basictad by preserving more temporal and spatial information in network representation (termed as plustad). empirical results demonstrate that our plustad is very efficient and significantly outperforms the previous methods on the datasets of thumos14 and fineaction. meanwhile, we also perform in-depth visualization and error analysis on our proposed method and try to provide more insights into the tad problem. our approach can serve as a strong baseline for future tad research. the code and model are released at https://github.com/mcg-nju/basictad.",AB_0361
"in this paper, we propose an ultrafast automated model compression framework called seernet for flexible network deployment. conventional non-differentiable methods discretely search the desirable compression policy based on the accuracy from exhaustively trained lightweight models, and existing differentiable methods optimize an extremely large supernet to obtain the required compressed model for deployment. they both cause heavy computational cost due to the complex compression policy search and evaluation process. on the contrary, we obtain the optimal efficient networks by directly optimizing the compression policy with an accurate performance predictor, where the ultrafast automated model compression for various computational cost constraint is achieved without complex compression policy search and evaluation. specifically, we first train the performance predictor based on the accuracy from uncertain compression policies actively selected by efficient evolutionary search, so that informative supervision is provided to learn the accurate performance predictor with acceptable cost. then we leverage the gradient that maximizes the predicted performance under the barrier complexity constraint for ultrafast acquisition of the desirable compression policy, where adaptive update stepsizes with momentum are employed to enhance optimality of the acquired pruning and quantization strategy. compared with the state-of-the-art automated model compression methods, experimental results on image classification and object detection show that our method achieves competitive accuracy-complexity trade-offs with significant reduction of the search cost. code is available at https://github.com/ ziweiwangthu/seernet.",AB_0361
"goal-conditioned rearrangement of deformable objects (e.g. straightening a rope and folding a cloth) is one of the most common deformable manipulation tasks, where the robot needs to rearrange a deformable object into a prescribed goal configuration with only visual observations. these tasks are typically confronted with two main challenges: the high dimensionality of deformable configuration space and the underlying complexity, nonlinearity and uncertainty inherent in deformable dynamics. to address these challenges, we propose a novel representation strategy that can efficiently model the deformable object states with a set of keypoints and their interactions. we further propose local-graph neural network (gnn), a light local gnn learning to jointly model the deformable rearrangement dynamics and infer the optimal manipulation actions (e.g. pick and place) by constructing and updating two dynamic graphs. both simulated and real experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed dynamic graph representation shows superior expressiveness in modeling deformable rearrangement dynamics. our method reaches much higher success rates on a variety of deformable rearrangement tasks (96.3% on average) than state-of-the-art method in simulation experiments. besides, our method is much more lighter and has a 60% shorter inference time than state-of-the-art methods. we also demonstrate that our method performs well in the multi-task learning scenario and can be transferred to real-world applications with an average success rate of 95% by solely fine tuning a keypoint detector. a supplementary video can be found at https://youtu.be/ahwtqo6fcm0.",AB_0361
"because of limited computation resources, convolutional neural networks (cnns) are difficult to deploy on mobile devices. to overcome this issue, many methods have successively reduced parameters in cnns with the idea of removing redundancy among feature maps. we observe similarities between feature maps at the same layer but not complete consistency. intuitively, the difference between similar feature maps is an essential ingredient for the success of cnns. therefore, we propose a flexible and separable convolution (fsconv) in a different perspective to embrace redundancy while requiring less computation, which can implicitly cluster feature maps into different clusters without introducing similarity measurements. our proposed model extracts intrinsic information from the representative part through ordinary convolution in each cluster and reveals tiny hidden details from the redundant part through groupwise/depthwise convolution. experimental results demonstrate that fsconv-equipped networks always perform better than previous state-of-the-art cnns compression algorithms. code is available at https://github.com/clarkxielf/ fsconv- flexible- and- separable- convolution- for- convolutional- neural- networks- compression .(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0361
"automatic medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and treatment. however, it is still a challenging task due to the complex interior characteristics ( e.g. , inconsistent intensity, low contrast, texture heterogeneity) and ambiguous external boundary structures. in this paper, we introduce a novel geometric structure learning mechanism (gslm) to overcome the limitations of existing segmentation models that lack learning focus, path, and difficulty. the geometric structure in this mechanism is jointly characterized by the skeleton-like structure extracted by the mask distance transform (mdt) and the boundary structure extracted by the mask distance inverse transform (mdit). among them, the skeleton-like and boundary pay attention to the trend of interior characteristics consistency and external structure continuity, respectively. with this idea, we design gsal, a novel end-to-end geometric structure adversarial learning for robust medical image segmentation. gsal has four components: a geometric structure generator, which yields the geometric structure to learn the most discriminative features that preserve interior characteristics consistency and external boundary structure continuity, skeletonlike and boundary structure discriminators, which enhance and correct the characterization of internal and external geometry to mutually promote the capture of global contextual dependencies, and a geometric structure fusion sub-network, which fuses the two complementary and refined skeleton-like and boundary structures to generate the high-quality segmentation results. the proposed approach has been successfully applied to three different challenging medical image segmentation tasks, including polyp segmentation, covid-19 lung infection segmentation, and lung nodule segmentation. extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed gsal achieves favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. the code is available at: https://github.com/dlwk/gsal .

"financial named entity recognition (finner) is a challenging task in the field of financial text information extraction, which aims to extract a large amount of financial knowledge from unstructured texts. it is widely accepted to use the sequence tagging framework to implement the finner tasks. however, such sequence tagging models cannot fully take advantage of the semantic information in the texts. instead, we formulate the finner task as a machine reading comprehension (mrc) problem and propose a new model termed finbert-mrc. this formulation introduces significant prior information by utilizing well-designed queries, and extracts the start index and end index of the target entities without decoding modules such as conditional random fields (crfs). we conduct experiments on a publicly available chinese financial dataset chfinann and a real-world business dataset adminpunish. finbert-mrc achieves average f-1 scores of 92.78% and 96.80% on two datasets, respectively, with average f(1 )gains + 3.75% and + 0.68% over some sequence tagging models including bilstm-crf, bigru-crf, bilstm-cnn-crf, finbert-tagger, and finbert-crf. the source code is available at https://github.com/zyz0000/finbert-mrc.",AB_0361
"camouflaged object detection (cod) aims to identify and segment items that are seamlessly assimilate into the surroundings. compared with the traditional image segmentation, the indefinable boundaries of camouflaged objects and high intrinsic similarities between the targets and the surrounding background make cod more challenging. although many models have been designed to settle this issue, these algorithms suffer from inaccurate contours. besides, existing cod methods mainly strive to expand the receptive field and excavate rich contextual cues using convolutional layers with large dilation rates. however, the tiny detailed information may be degenerated in this process due to the large ``holes'' in these dilated convolutional layers. this paper develops a novel boundary-guided context-aware network (bcnet) to deal with these problems. specifically, we design a high-resolution feature enhancement module to excavate multi-scale information and enlarge the receptive field without destroying the tiny details within the input feature maps. the proposed module is effective in enhancing the single- layer feature and boosting the cod performance. besides, a boundary-guided feature interaction module is designed to aggregate multi-level features and investigate the complementary relationship between the targets and the corresponding contours. we evaluate bcnet on four benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the key modules. the experimental results demonstrate that bcnet achieves a real-time inference speed (49 fps) on a titan xp gpu and surpasses 19 cutting-edge contenders. source code will be available at https://github.com/clelouch/ bcnet.",AB_0361
"data augmentation has been shown to improve graph neural networks (gnns). existing graph data augmentation is achieved by adding or removing edges or changing the input node features due to graph data's complexity and non-euclidean nature. however, the graphs generated by the above augmentation operations have similar or identical structures as the original graph, which leads to similar or identical structural information learned by gnns from the original and augmented graphs. two problems arise from this: restricted information and low applicability. to solve these problems, we propose class-homophilic-based data augmentation (coda), which improves existing gnns by helping them learn adequate and extra structural class information, which is lacking in the original graph, and promotes gnns' application to graphs with a large number of interclass edges. we first pretrain the gnns and then design a new augmentation method that generates an approximate class-homophilic graph according to the pretrained gnns. in the end, we design learnable node-level self-attention mechanisms with telescopic coefficients, which result in gnns integrating the structural information of the two graphs in a more principled way to break the constraint of pretrained gnns. extensive experiments on various datasets show that augmentation via coda improves performance and applicability across gnn architectures. the source code of coda is publicly available at https://github.com/graphnn/coda.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0361
"few-shot knowledge graph completion (fskgc) refers to predicting new facts for a new relation with only few-shot observed entity pairs (triples) as support set. existing solutions to fskgc mainly conduct the matching process over entity pair representations. although effective, a major concern of these models is that the entity interactions are not fully explored, based on the observation that they usually generate the pair representation before the matching stage. such a design inherently overlooks the finegrained information from entity interactions, leading to performance decrements in one or three shot, which require matching models to capture more sufficient semantic meanings for prediction. to remedy this issue, in this paper, we explore the entity interactions within and between different instances, i.e., the co-occurrence of two entities, for fskgc and propose our model named transam, transformer appending matcher. transam solves the fskgc problem by computing the probability of entity sequence with a well-designed transformer matching network. specifically, transam appends query entity pair to serialized reference entity sequence and utilizes transformer to calculate the probability by capturing intra- and inter- triple entity interactions. to bridge the gap between transformer and the triple structure, transam introduces rotary operation to preserve the head and tail roles of entity within the triple and distinguishes different triples by a separated triple position encoding. empirical studies on two public benchmark datasets nell-one and wiki-one show that transam outperforms existing metric-learning solutions in mrr and hits@1 with both one- and three- shot settings, and achieves comparable results on five-shot setting. datasets and code will be public available at https://github.com/gawainx/transam.

"multi-scale feature fusion is a commonly-used module in existing deep-learning models, and feature misalignment occurs in the process of feature fusion. the spatial misalignment hinders the learning of semantic representation with multi-scale levels, but which has not received much attention. this misalignment problem is caused by the feature position shift after using the convolution and interpolation operation in feature fusion. to solve the misalignment problem, this paper formulates the shift error mathematically and proposes a plug-and-play unbiased feature position alignment strategy to align convolution with interpolation. as a model-agnostic approach, unbiased feature position alignment can boost the performance of different models without introducing extra parameters. furthermore, the unbiased feature position alignment is applied to build an unbiased human pose estimation method. experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed unbiased pose model in comparison to the state-of-the-arts, especially in the low-resolution field. the codes are shared at https:// github.com/wangchen100/unbiased-feature-position-alignment-for-human-pose-estimation.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0361
