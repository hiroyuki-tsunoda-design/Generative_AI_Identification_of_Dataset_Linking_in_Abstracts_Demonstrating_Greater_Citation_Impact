"introductionassessment of human gait posture can be clinically effective in diagnosing human gait deformities early in life. currently, two methods-static and dynamic-are used to diagnose adult spinal deformity (asd) and other spinal disorders. full-spine lateral standing radiographs are used in the standard static method. however, this is a static assessment of joints in the standing position and does not include information on joint changes when the patient walks. careful observation of long-distance walking can provide a dynamic assessment that reveals an uncompensated posture; however, this increases the workload of medical practitioners. a three-dimensional (3d) motion system is proposed for the dynamic method. although the motion system successfully detected dynamic posture changes, access to the facilities was limited. therefore, a diagnostic approach that is facility-independent, has low practice flow, and does not involve patient contact is required.methodswe focused on a video-based method to classify patients with spinal disorders either as asd, or other forms of asd. to achieve this goal, we present a video-based two-stage machine-learning method. in the first stage, deep learning methods are used to locate the patient and extract the area where the patient is located. in the second stage, a 3d cnn (convolutional neural network) device is used to capture spatial and temporal information (dynamic motion) from the extracted frames. disease classification is performed by discerning posture and gait from the extracted frames. model performance was assessed using the mean accuracy, f1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc), with five-fold cross-validation. we also compared the final results with professional observations.resultsour experiments were conducted using a gait video dataset comprising 81 patients. the experimental results indicated that our method is effective for classifying asd and other spinal disorders. the proposed method achieved a mean accuracy of 0.7553, an f1 score of 0.7063, and an auroc score of 0.7864. additionally, ablation experiments indicated the importance of the first stage (detection stage) and transfer learning of our proposed method.discussionthe observations from the two doctors were compared using the proposed method. the mean accuracies observed by the two doctors were 0.4815 and 0.5247, with auroc scores of 0.5185 and 0.5463, respectively. we proved that the proposed method can achieve accurate and reliable medical testing results compared with doctors' observations using videos of 1 s duration. all our code, models, and results are available at https://github.com/chenkaixusan/walk_video_pytorch. the proposed framework provides a potential video-based method for improving the clinical diagnosis for asd and non-asd. this framework might, in turn, benefit both patients and clinicians to treat the disease quickly and directly and further reduce facility dependency and data-driven systems.",AB_0072
"introductionsleep enhances the antibody response to vaccination, but the relationship between sleep and mrna vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is not fully understood.methodsin this prospective observational study, we investigated the influence of sleep habits on immune acquisition induced by mrna vaccines against sars-cov-2 in 48 healthy adults (bnt-162b2, n=34; mrna-1273, n=14; female, n=30, 62.5%; male, n=18, 37.5%; median age, 39.5 years; interquartile range, 33.0-44.0 years) from june 2021 to january 2022. the study measured sleep duration using actigraphy and sleep diaries, which covered the periods of the initial and booster vaccinations.resultsmultivariable linear regression analysis showed that actigraphy-measured objective sleep duration 3 and 7 days after the booster vaccination was independently and significantly correlated with higher antibody titers (b=0.003; 95% confidence interval, 0.000-0.005; beta=0.337; p=0.02), even after controlling for covariates, including age, sex, the type of vaccine, and reactogenicity to the vaccination. associations between acquired antibody titer and average objective sleep duration before vaccination, and any period of subjective sleep duration measured by sleep diary were negligible.discussionlonger objective, but not subjective, sleep duration after booster vaccination enhances antibody response. hence, encouraging citizens to sleep longer after mrna vaccination, especially after a booster dose, may increase protection against sars-cov-2.study registrationthis study is registered at the university hospital medical information network center (umin: https://www.umin.ac.jp) on july 30, 2021, #umin000045009.",AB_0072
"cancer drug response prediction is a crucial task in precision medicine, but existing models have limitations in effectively representing molecular profiles of cancer cells. specifically, when these models represent molecular omics data such as gene expression, they employ a one-hot encoding-based approach, where a fixed gene set is selected for all samples and omics data values are assigned to specific positions in a vector. however, this approach restricts the utilization of embedding-vector-based methods, such as attention-based models, and limits the flexibility of gene selection. to address these issues, our study proposes gene embedding-based fully connected neural networks (gen) that utilizes gene embedding vectors as input data for cancer drug response prediction. the gen allows for the use of embedding-vector-based architectures and different gene sets for each sample, providing enhanced flexibility. to validate the efficacy of gen, we conducted experiments on three cancer drug response datasets. our results demonstrate that gen outperforms other recently developed methods in cancer drug prediction tasks and offers improved gene representation capabilities. all source codes are available at https://github.com/dmcb-gist/gen/.",AB_0072
"motivation methods for concept recognition (cr) in clinical texts have largely been tested on abstracts or articles from the medical literature. however, texts from electronic health records (ehrs) frequently contain spelling errors, abbreviations, and other nonstandard ways of representing clinical concepts.results here, we present a method inspired by the blast algorithm for biosequence alignment that screens texts for potential matches on the basis of matching k-mer counts and scores candidates based on conformance to typical patterns of spelling errors derived from 2.9 million clinical notes. our method, the term-blast-like alignment tool (tblat) leverages a gold standard corpus for typographical errors to implement a sequence alignment-inspired method for efficient entity linkage. we present a comprehensive experimental comparison of tblat with five widely used tools. experimental results show an increase of 10% in recall on scientific publications and 20% increase in recall on ehr records (when compared against the next best method), hence supporting a significant enhancement of the entity linking task. the method can be used stand-alone or as a complement to existing approaches.availability and implementation fenominal is a java library that implements tblat for named cr of human phenotype ontology terms and is available at https://github.com/monarch-initiative/fenominal under the gnu general public license v3.0.",AB_0072
"face anti-spoofing, which aims to defend against various attacks in face authentication systems, has drawn increasing attention with the advance in biometrics. although many studies for face anti-spoofing have shown the remarkable performance improvement, they still suffer from a lack of generality, i.e., vulnerability to unknown attacks frequently occurring in real-world scenarios. recently, the one-class learning approach has emerged as a way to overcome the aforementioned issue thanks to its capability to distinguish unseen forgery types by precisely understanding the subtle pattern of real faces. however, it is quite a difficult problem to determine the accurate decision boundary by only using real facial images. to cope with this limitation, we propose to apply a novel pseudo-negative sampling scheme in one-class learning for face anti-spoofing. more concretely, pseudo-negative samples are generated based on the statistical distribution of real facial samples and utilized as the proxy of fake facial samples to construct the robust decision boundary. the proposed method is designed by following a two-stage unsupervised learning framework. firstly, the model learns the feature representation of real faces via the siamese architecture in the pre-training stage. in the fine-tuning stage, pseudo-negative features are randomly sampled at a suitable distance from real facial features in the latent space. these sampled features are then utilized with real facial features to guide the classifier. since such pseudo-negative features are not limited to specific fake properties, our classifier can effectively learn to distinguish real and fake faces without using any fake facial images during the training. experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is effective for face anti-spoofing even with unseen spoofing attacks, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the replay-attack dataset, i.e., 94.48% in auc. the code and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/dcvl-fa/pns-release.",AB_0072

"backgroundyukgunja-tang (ygj) is an herbal prescription used to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). although many preclinical and clinical studies on ygj have been conducted on gerd, there is a lack of evidence from blinded studies to exclude placebo effects. therefore, this protocol proposes a clinical trial that is single-centered, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy to objectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of co-administered ygj and rabeprazole (rpz) in patients with gerd previously treated with proton pump inhibitors (ppis) and still experiencing symptoms.methodsa total of 86 participants with refractory gerd (rgerd) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment [ygj and rpz (10 mg/d)] and control groups [double-dose rpz (20 mg/d)] for 4 weeks of treatment (weeks 0-4) followed by 4 weeks of follow-up (weeks 4-8). the frequency scale for the symptoms of gerd will be analyzed for the primary endpoint. reflux disease questionnaire, reflux symptom score, gerd-health related quality of life, overall treatment evaluation, spleen qi deficiency questionnaire, damum questionnaire, and dyspepsia visual analogue scale will be used to evaluate treatment effects on gerd related symptoms and quality of life and to compare treatment effects by subgroups. safety tests will be analyzed by investigating adverse events.discussionthis clinical trial will be the first rigorous double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled study to precisely evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of ygj and ppis in the treatment of rgerd. the results of this study will provide a reliable clinical basis for selecting botanical drug treatments for patients with rgerd.trial registrationclinical research information service (registration number: kct0008600, july 13, 2023, https://cris.nih.go.kr).",AB_0072
"background: respiratory exacerbations in children and adolescents with bronchiectasis are treated with antibiotics. however, antibiotics can have variable interindividual effects when treating exacerbations.research question: can phenotypic features associated with symptom resolution after a 14-day course of oral antibiotics for a nonsevere exacerbation of bronchiectasis be identified? studydesign and methods: combining data from two multicenter randomized controlled trials, we identified 217 children with bronchiectasis assigned to at least 14 days of oral antibiotics to treat nonsevere (nonhospitalized) exacerbations. univariable and then multi variable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with symptom resolution within 14 days of commencing antibiotics. identified associations were re-evaluated by mediation analysis.results: of the 217 study participants (52% male patients), 41% were indigenous (australian first nations, new zealand maori, or pacific islander). the median age was 6.6 years (interquartile range, 4.0-10.1 years). by day 14, symptoms had resolved in 130 children (responders), but persisted in the remaining 87 children (nonresponders). multivariable analysis found those who were indigenous (adjusted or [aor], 3.59; 95% ci, 1.35-9.54) or showed new abnormal auscultatory findings (aor, 3.85; 95% ci, 1.56-9.52) were more likely to be responders, whereas those with multiple bronchiectatic lobes at diagnosis (aor, 0.66; 95% ci, 0.46-0.95) or higher cough scores when starting exacerbation treatment (aor, 0.55; 95% ci, 0.34-0.90) were more likely to be nonresponders. detecting a respiratory virus at the beginning of an exacerbation was not associated with antibiotic failure at 14 days.interpretation: children with indigenous ethnicity, milder bronchiectasis, mild exacerbations (low reported cough scores), or new abnormal auscultatory signs are more likely to respond to appropriate oral antibiotics than those without these features. these patient and exacerbation phenotypes may assist clinical management and development of biomarkers to identify those whose symptoms are more likely to resolve after 14 days of oral antibiotics.trial registry: australian new zealand clinical trials registry; nos.: actrn12612000011886 and actrn12612000010897; url: https://www.anzctr.org.au",AB_0072
"motivation predicting protein structures with high accuracy is a critical challenge for the broad community of life sciences and industry. despite progress made by deep neural networks like alphafold2, there is a need for further improvements in the quality of detailed structures, such as side-chains, along with protein backbone structures.results building upon the successes of alphafold2, the modifications we made include changing the losses of side-chain torsion angles and frame aligned point error, adding loss functions for side chain confidence and secondary structure prediction, and replacing template feature generation with a new alignment method based on conditional random fields. we also performed re-optimization by conformational space annealing using a molecular mechanics energy function which integrates the potential energies obtained from distogram and side-chain prediction. in the casp15 blind test for single protein and domain modeling (109 domains), deepfold ranked fourth among 132 groups with improvements in the details of the structure in terms of backbone, side-chain, and molprobity. in terms of protein backbone accuracy, deepfold achieved a median gdt-ts score of 88.64 compared with 85.88 of alphafold2. for tbm-easy/hard targets, deepfold ranked at the top based on z-scores for gdt-ts. this shows its practical value to the structural biology community, which demands highly accurate structures. in addition, a thorough analysis of 55 domains from 39 targets with publicly available structures indicates that deepfold shows superior side-chain accuracy and molprobity scores among the top-performing groups.availability and implementation deepfold tools are open-source software available at https://github.com/newtonjoo/deepfold.",AB_0072
"introduction: withania somnifera (ws) or ashwagandha is an adaptogenic plant used extensively in traditional medicines and as a food supplement. despite a long history of use and numerous clinical trials, the human pharmacokinetics of withanolides, the active phytochemicals in ws extracts, have not been fully evaluated. this study evaluated the oral pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of active withanolides in human plasma after administration of a single dose of two commercial ashwagandha extracts containing equal amounts of total withanolides.methods: this randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover study of 16 healthy human vol-unteers evaluated the acute oral bioavailability of withanolides and the bioequivalence of two ws extracts, ws-35 and ws-2.5. ws-35 was standardized to total withanolides not less than 40% comprising not less than 35% withanolide glycosides and ws-2.5 was standardized to 2.5% withanolides. the clinical dosages were normalized to 185 mg of total withanolide in each extract at the bioequivalent dosages. the pharmacokinetic parameters of withanolide a, withanoside iv, withaferin a, and total withanolides were quantified in the blood plasma using a validated lc-ms/ms method.results: the half-life, c-max, and mean residence time of the total withanolides were 5.18, 5.62 and 4.13 times significantly higher and had lower systemic clearance with ws-35 than with ws-2.5 extract. considering the plasma auc 0-inf of total withanolides per mg of each ws extract administered orally, ws-35 was 280.74 times more bioavailable than ws-2.5.conclusion: the results of this study highlight the importance of withanolide glycosides in improving the pharmacokinetics of ws extracts. owing to its superior pharmacokinetic profile, ws-35, with 35% withanolide glycosides, is a promising candidate for further studies on withania somnifera.clinical trial registration: ctri/2020/10/028397 [registered on:13/10/2020] (trial prospectively registered) http://ctri.nic.in/clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?trialid=42149&enchid=&username =ctri/2020/10/028397.",AB_0072
