"plant small secretory peptides (ssps) play an important role in the regulation of biological processes in plants. accurately predicting ssps enables efficient exploration of their functions. traditional experimental verification methods are very reliable and accurate, but they require expensive equipment and a lot of time. the method of machine learning speeds up the prediction process of ssps, but the instability of feature extraction will also lead to further limitations of this type of method. therefore, this paper proposes a new feature-correction-based model for ssp recognition in plants, abbreviated as se-ssp. the model mainly includes the following three advantages: first, the use of transformer encoders can better reveal implicit features. second, design a feature correction module suitable for sequences, named 2-d senet, to adaptively adjust the features to obtain a more robust feature representation. third, stack multiple linear modules to further dig out the deep information on the sample. at the same time, the training based on a contrastive learning strategy can alleviate the problem of sparse samples. we construct experiments on publicly available data sets, and the results verify that our model shows an excellent performance. the proposed model can be used as a convenient and effective ssp prediction tool in the future. our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/wrab12/se-ssp/.",AB_0149
"purpose this study aims to investigate the effect of microtextured tools on the geometric morphology of serrated chips, and further improve the cutting performance of polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (pcbn) tool and extend the tool life and the surface quality of the machined surface.design/methodology/approach a three-dimensional finite element cutting model of hardened steel aisi d2 with microtextured pcbn tools were established using the finite element software abaqus, and cutting tests were carried out. furthermore, the stress distribution in the primary deformation zone was investigated based on the triaxiality of stress, and the influence of microtexture on the geometric morphology of serrated chips and crack development was researched.findings the results show that compared with nontexture tools, elliptical pits and wavy grooves microtexture tools have lower serrated degree gs, higher serrated frequency f per unit length and more miniature serrated step pc. the serrated phenomenon is intensified because the tensile stress zone of chips generated by nontextured tools is longer than that of elliptic pits and wavy grooves microtexture tools. simultaneously, the maximum value of triaxiality in the tensile stress zone achieved by nontexture tools is larger than that of the two microtexture tools, and chips obtained by nontextured tools are more susceptible to propagation fractures.originality/value this paper mainly studies the effect of microtexture on chip microgeometry, which is relatively little studied at present. at the same time, this paper has a certain engineering significance for pcbn tool turning hardening steel.peer review the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-05-2023-0149/",AB_0149
"backgrounds: the safety of different sodium-glucose transporter 2 (sglt-2) inhibitors remains uncertain due to the lack of head-to-head comparisons. methods: this network meta-analysis (nma) was performed to compare the safety of nine sglt-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (t2dm). pubmed, embase, cochrane central register of controlled trials and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies published in english before august 30, 2022. published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing the safety of individual sglt-2 inhibitors in patients with t2dm were included. a bayesian nma with random effects model was applied. subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the confidence in network meta-analysis framework. results: nine sglt-2 inhibitors were evaluated in 113 rcts (12 registries) involving 105,293 adult patients. reproductive tract infections (rtis) were reported in 1,967 (4.51%) and 276 (1.01%) patients in the sglt-2 inhibitor and placebo groups, respectively. furthermore, pollakiuria was reported in 233 (2.66%) and 45 (0.84%) patients, respectively. compared to placebo, a significantly higher risk of rtis was observed with canagliflozin, ertugliflozin, empagliflozin, remogliflozin, dapagliflozin, and sotagliflozin, but not with luseogliflozin and ipragliflozin, regardless of gender. an increased risk of pollakiuria was observed with dapagliflozin [ odds ratio ( or) 10.40, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.60-157.94) and empagliflozin (or 5.81, 95%ci 1.7932.97). remogliflozin (or 6.45, 95%ci 2.18-27.79) and dapagliflozin (or 1.33, 95%ci 1.10-1.62) were associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (utis). instead, the included sglt-2 inhibitors had a protective effect against acute kidney injury (aki). no significant differences were found for hypovolemia, renal impairment or failure, fracture, diabetic ketoacidosis (dka), amputation, and severe hypoglycemia between the sglt-2 inhibitor and the placebo groups. conclusion: in patients with t2dm, dapagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of rtis, pollakiuria, and utis. empagliflozin increased the risk of rtis and pollakiuria. remogliflozin increased the risk of utis. none of the sglt-2 inhibitors showed a significant difference from the placebo for hypovolemia, renal impairment or failure, fracture, dka, amputation, and severe hypoglycemia. the findings guide the selection of sglt-2 inhibitors for patients with t2dm based on the patient's profiles to maximize safety. systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier crd42022334644.",AB_0149
"background patients with remitted major depressive disorder (rmdd) show abnormal functional connectivity of the central executive network (cen), salience networks (sn) and default mode network (dmn). it is unclear how these change during remission, or whether changes are related to function. methods three spatial networks in 17 patients with rmdd were compared between baseline and the six-month follow-up, and to 22 healthy controls. correlations between these changes and psychosocial functioning were also assessed. results in the cen, patients at baseline had abnormal functional connectivity in the right anterior cingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) and inferior parietal lobule (ipl) compare with hcs. there were functional connection differences in the right dlpfc and left ipl at baseline during follow-up. abnormal connectivity in the right dlpfc and medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) were found at follow-up. in the sn, patients at baseline had abnormal functional connectivity in the insula, left anterior cingulate, left ipl, and right precuneus; compared with baseline, patients had higher connectivity in the right dlpfc at follow-up. in the dmn, patients at baseline had abnormal functional connectivity in the right mpfc. resting-state functional connectivity of the ipl and dlpfc in the cen correlated with psychosocial functioning. conclusions at six-month follow-up, the cen still showed abnormal functional connectivity in those with rmdd, while anomalies in the sn and dmn has disappeared. resting-state functional connectivity of the cen during early rmdd is associated with psychosocial function. clinical trials registration pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for mdd after remission on psychology and neuroimaging. https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/, registration number: nct01831440 (15/4/2013).",AB_0149
"lampreys are blood-sucking vampires in marine environments. from a survival perspective, it is expected that the lamprey buccal gland exhibits a repository of pharmacologically active components to modulate the host's homeostasis, inflammatory and immune responses. by analyzing the metabolic profiles of 14 different lamprey tissues, we show that two groups of metabolites in the buccal gland of lampreys, prostaglandins and the kynurenine pathway metabolites, can be injected into the host fish to assist lamprey blood feeding. prostaglandins are well-known blood-sucking-associated metabolites that act as vasodilators and anticoagulants to maintain vascular homeostasis and are involved in inflammatory responses. the vasomotor reactivity test on catfish aortic ring showed that kynurenine can also relax the blood vessels of the host fish, thus improving the blood flow of the host fish at the bite site. finally, a lamprey spatial metabolomics database (https://www.lampreydb.com) was constructed to assist studies using lampreys as animal model.",AB_0149
"in this paper, we present the ustc flicar dataset, which is dedicated to the development of simultaneous localization and mapping and precise 3d reconstruction of the workspace for heavy-duty autonomous aerial work robots. in recent years, numerous public datasets have played significant roles in the advancement of autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs). however, these two platforms differ from aerial work robots: uavs are limited in their payload capacity, while cars are restricted to two-dimensional movements. to fill this gap, we create the giraffe mapping robot based on a bucket truck, which is equipped with a variety of well-calibrated and synchronized sensors: four 3d lidars, two stereo cameras, two monocular cameras, inertial measurement units (imus), and a gnss/ins system. a laser tracker is used to record the millimeter-level ground truth positions. we also make its ground twin, the okapi mapping robot, to gather data for comparison. the proposed dataset extends the typical autonomous driving sensing suite to aerial scenes, demonstrating the potential of combining autonomous driving perception systems with bucket trucks to create a versatile autonomous aerial working platform. moreover, based on the segment anything model (sam), we produce the semantic flicar dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for multimodal continuous data in both temporal and spatial dimensions. the dataset is available for download at: https://ustc-flicar.github.io/.",AB_0149
"predicting protein stability change upon variation through a computational approach is a valuable tool to unveil the mechanisms of mutation-induced drug failure and develop immunotherapy strategies. some previous machine learning-based techniques exhibit anti-symmetric bias toward destabilizing situations, whereas others struggle with generalization to unseen examples. to address these issues, we propose a gated graph neural network-based approach to predict changes in protein stability upon mutation. the model uses message passing to encode the links between the molecular structure and property after eliminating the non-mutant structure and creating input feature vectors. while doing so, it also incorporates the coordinates of the raw atoms to provide spatial insights into the chemical systems. we test the model on the ssym, myoglobin, broom, and p53 datasets to demonstrate the generalization performance. compared to existing approaches, our proposed method achieves improved linearity with symmetry in less time. the code for this study is available at: https://github.com/ hongzhoutang/pros-gnn.",AB_0149
"distinguishing non-coding rnas (ncrnas) from coding rnas is very important in bioinformatics. although many methods have been proposed for solving this task, it remains highly challenging to further improve the accuracy of ncrna identification. in this paper, we propose a coding potential predictor using feature representation learning based on pseudo rna sequences named cppflps. in this method, we use the pseudo rna sequences generated by simulating rna sequence mutations as new samples for data augmentation, and six string operations simulating rna sequence mutations are considered: base replacement, base insertion, base deletion, subsequence reversion, subsequence repetition and subsequence deletion. in the feature representation learning framework, different types of pseudo rna sequences are added to the training set to form new training sets that can be used to train baseline classifiers, thus obtaining baseline models. the resulting labels of these baseline models are used as feature vectors to represent rna sequences, and the resulting feature vectors acquired after feature selection are used to train a predictive model for distinguishing ncrnas from coding rnas. our method achieves better performance compared with that of existing state-of-the-art methods. the implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/chenxgscuec/cppflps.",AB_0149
"scene understanding based on image segmentation is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles. pixel-wise semantic segmentation of rgb images can be advanced by exploiting complementary features from the supplementary modality (x-modality). however, covering a wide variety of sensors with a modality-agnostic model remains an unresolved problem due to variations in sensor characteristics among different modalities. unlike previous modality-specific methods, in this work, we propose a unified fusion framework, cmx, for rgb-x semantic segmentation. to generalize well across different modalities, that often include supplements as well as uncertainties, a unified cross-modal interaction is crucial for modality fusion. specifically, we design a cross-modal feature rectification module (cm-frm) to calibrate bi-modal features by leveraging the features from one modality to rectify the features of the other modality. with rectified feature pairs, we deploy a feature fusion module (ffm) to perform sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing. to verify cmx, for the first time, we unify five modalities complementary to rgb, i.e., depth, thermal, polarization, event, and lidar. extensive experiments show that cmx generalizes well to diverse multi-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five rgb-depth benchmarks, as well as rgb-thermal, rgb-polarization, and rgb-lidar datasets. besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an rgb-event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the eventscape dataset, on which cmx sets the new state-of-the-art. the source code of cmx is publicly available at https://github.com/huaaaliu/rgbx_semantic_ segmentation.",AB_0149
"in recent years, zero-shot node classification (znc), an emerging and more difficult task is starting to attract attention, where the classes of testing nodes are unobserved in the training stage. existing studies for znc mainly utilize graph neural networks (gnns) to construct the feature subspace to align with the classes' semantic subspace, thus enabling knowledge transfer from seen classes to unseen classes. however, the modeling of the node feature is singleview and unilateral, e.g., the bag-of-words vector, which is not enough to fully describe the characteristics of the node itself. to address this dilemma, we propose to develop the multi-view enhanced zero-shot node classification paradigm (mve) to promote the machine's generality to approach the human-like thinking mode. specifically, multi-view features are obtained from different aspects such as pre-trained model embeddings, knowledge graphs, statistic methods, and then fused by a contrastive learning module into the compositional node representation. meanwhile, a developed graph convolutional network (gcn) is used to make the nodes fully absorb the information of neighbors while the over-smooth issue is alleviated by multi-view features and the proposed contrastive learning mechanism. experimental results conducted on three public datasets show an average 25% improvement compared to baseline methods, proving the superiority of our multi-view learning framework. the code and data can be found at https://github.com/guaiqihen/mve.",AB_0149
