"collision risk assessment aims to provide a subjective cognitive comprehension of the risk level in driving scenarios, which is critical for the safety of autonomous driving systems. pedestrian crossing scenarios contain intricate human-vehicle interactions. hence, it is important to capture the rich relations between traffic entities and to assess the collision risk promptly to ensure safety. existing studies focus on modeling the spatial relationships between the ego-vehicle and other vehicles in typical traffic scenarios, while ignoring the complex interactions between pedestrians and the ego-vehicle in critical driving scenarios. to address this issue, we propose a novel approach that involves constructing traffic scene graphs with enhanced vehicle-pedestrian interactions, along with introducing an innovative deep model built upon transformer and gcn for pedestrian collision risk assessment. specifically, to facilitate spatio-temporal modeling of traffic scene graph sequence, we propose a novel unified framework that integrates multi-relation graph convolution network (mr-gcn) and temporal transformer encoder. in addition, two variants of traffic scene graph datasets termed as interaction-enhanced scene graph (iesg) and none-interaction-enhanced scene graph (non-iesg) are created for the purpose of assessing pedestrian collision risk, utilizing the cap-data and jaad respectively. experiments are conducted on our newly created traffic scene graph datasets of pedestrian crossing scenes. the results on the iesg dataset show that our model outperforms the baseline model with higher accuracy (94% vs. 84%), higher auc (98% vs. 89%), and higher f1-score (93% vs. 84%). iesg and non-iesg datasets are available at https://github. com/pedestrian-crossing-collision-risk-assessment-datasets.",AB_0147
"long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) and micrornas (mirnas) are two prevalent non-coding rnas in current research. they play critical regulatory roles in the life processes of animals and plants. studies have shown that lncrnas can interact with mirnas to participate in post-transcriptional regulatory processes, mainly involved in regulating cancer development, metastatic progression, and drug resistance. additionally, these interactions have significant effects on plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. deciphering the potential relationships between lncrnas and mirnas may provide new insights into our understanding of the biological functions of lncrnas and mirnas, and the pathogenesis of complex diseases. in contrast, gathering information on lncrna-mirna interactions (lmis) through biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming. with the accumulation of multi-omics data, computational models are extremely attractive in systematically exploring potential lmis. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of computational methods for identifying lmis. specifically, we first summarized the available public databases for predicting animal and plant lmis. second, we comprehensively reviewed the computational methods for predicting lmis and classified them into two categories, including network-based methods and sequence-based methods. third, we analyzed the standard evaluation methods and metrics used in lmi prediction. finally, we pointed out some problems in the current study and discuss future research directions. relevant databases and the latest advances in lmi prediction are summarized in a github repository https://github.com/sheng-n/lncrna-mirna-interaction-methods, and we'll keep it updated.",AB_0147
"inframe insertion/deletion (indel) variants may alter protein sequence and function, which are closely related to an extensive variety of diseases. although recent researches have paid attention to the associations between inframe indels and diseases, modeling indels in silico and interpreting their pathogenicity remain challenging, mainly due to the lack of experimental information and computational methodologies. in this article, we propose a novel computational method named predinid (predictor for inframe indels) via graph convolutional network (gcn). predinid leverages k-nearest neighbor algorithm to construct the feature graph for aggregating more informative representation, regarding the pathogenic inframe indel prediction as a node classification task. an edge-based sampling strategy is designed for extracting information from both the potential connections of feature space and the topological structure of subgraphs. evaluated by 5-fold cross-validations, the predinid method achieves satisfactory performance and is superior to four classic machine learning algorithms and two gcn methods. comprehensive experiments show that predinid has superior performances when compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the independent test set. moreover, we also implement a web server at http://predinid.bio.aielab.cc/, to facilitate the use of the model.",AB_0147
"rna-binding proteins are important for the process of cell life activities. high-throughput technique experimental method to discover rna-protein binding sites is time-consuming and expensive. deep learning is an effective theory for predicting rna-protein binding sites. using weighted voting method to integrate multiple basic classifier models can improve model performance. thus, in our study, we propose a weighted voting deep learning model (wvdl), which uses weighted voting method to combine convolutional neural network (cnn), long short term memory network (lstm) and residual network (resnet). first, the final forecast result of wvdl outperforms the basic classifier models and other ensemble strategies. second, wvdl can extract more effective features by using weighted voting to find the best weighted combination. and, the cnn model also can draw the predicted motif pictures. third, wvdl gets a competitive experiment result on public rbp-24 datasets comparing with other state-of-the-art methods. the source code of our proposed wvdl can be found in https://github.com/biomg/wvdl.",AB_0147

"rgbt object tracking is an important research topic due to the complementary features of visible and thermal infrared images. however, the established fast-tracking siamese series rgbt trackers do not fully exploit the predicted results and global information, which leads to poor tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as target object deformation and fast movement. to address these challenges, we propose a dynamic feature-memory transformer rgbt tracking framework in this article. precisely, we extract the features of visible and infrared image pairs separately using convolutional networks. we then fuse the complementary semantic information using our proposed complementary semantic fusion module, which consists of a group convolution, a channel attention structure, a flattening operation, and channel reduction. next, we concatenate the dynamic memory feature extracted from the predicted frame pair, the template pair feature, and the search region pair feature. then input concatenated features into transformer encoder-decoder modules to acquire the global information and further fuse the rgbt features. finally, we predict the object state using the tracking head while deciding whether to update the dynamic memory feature using the reliability estimator. we conducted extensive experiments on the widely used rgbt234 and lasher datasets to evaluate the proposed framework's performance. the experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art rgbt trackers, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. overall, our proposed framework leverages visible and infrared images and incorporates global information and dynamic memory features, offering a promising solution to the challenges in rgbt object tracking. code will be open sourced at https://github.com/eloeszhang/dfmtnet",AB_0147
"light detection and ranging (lidar) limitations in adverse weather (e.g., rain, fog, and snow) prevent adopting high-level autonomous vehicles in all weather conditions. furthermore, collecting and annotating these sparse point clouds in adverse weather is often cumbersome, inefficient, and expensive. in this article, we propose a data-driven approach to statistically model the performance of a popular near-infrared (nir) time-of-flight (tof) lidar in fog, with noisy point clouds collected in a well-controlled artificial fog chamber. given manually defined visibility describing the levels of fog, our models can directly forecast a probability distribution of a laser's noisy range measurement. moreover, the real road data collected in clear weather is utilized to produce auto-labeled noisy point clouds using a lidar performance simulator, which is then used to train a semantic segmentation network to recognize point cloud noise in the real world in adverse weather. qualitative and quantitative experimental results verify the applicability of our lidar performance models in fog and show how our sim2real strategy of the denoising algorithm can be applied to noisy point clouds under various weather conditions. the developed robot operating system (ros) packages are publicly available at: https://github.com/cavayangtao/lanoise_pp.",AB_0147

"we propose a multi-view stereo network based on multi-distribution fitting (mdf-net), which achieves high-resolution depth map prediction with low memory and high efficiency. this method adopts a four-stage cascade structure, which mainly has the following three contributions. first, view cost regularization is proposed to weaken the influence of matching noise on building the cost volume. second, it is suggested to adaptively calculate the depth refinement interval using multi-distribution fitting (mdf). gaussian distribution fitting is used to refine and correct depth within a large interval, and then laplace distribution fitting is used to accurately estimate depth within a small interval. third, the lightweight image super-resolution network is applied to upsample the depth map in the fourth stage to reduce running time and memory requirements. the experimental results on the dtu dataset indicate that mdf-net has achieved the most advanced results. it has the lowest memory consumption and running time among the high-resolution reconstruction methods, requiring only approximately 4.29g memory for predicting a depth map with the resolution of 1600 x 1184. in addition, we validate the generalization ability on tanks and temples dataset, achieving very competitive performance. the code has been released at https://github.com/zongh5a/mdf-net.",AB_0147
