"in the past few years, convolutional neural networks (cnns) have become the primary workhorse for image restoration tasks. however, the deficiency of modeling long-range dependencies due to the local computational property of convolution greatly limits the restoration performance. to overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage progressive convolutional transformer to recursively restore the degraded images, termed pcformer, which enjoys a high capability for capturing local context and global dependencies with friendly computational cost. specifically, each stage of pcformer is an asymmetric encoder-decoder network whose bottleneck is built upon a tailored transformer block with convolution operation deployed to avoid any loss of local context. both encoder and decoder are convolution-based modules, thus allowing to explore rich contextualized information for image recovery. taking the low-resolution features encoded by the encoder as tokens input into the transformer bottleneck guarantees that long-range pixel interactions are captured while reducing the computational burden. meanwhile, we apply a gated module for filtering redundant information propagation between every two phases. in addition, long-range enhanced inpainting is further introduced to mining the ability of pcformer to exploit distant complementary features. extensive experiments yield superior results and in particular establishing new state-of-the-art results on several image restoration tasks, including deraining (+0.37 db on rain13k), denoising (+0.11 db on dnd), dehazing (+0.56 db on i-haze), enhancement (+0.72 db on sice), and shadow removal (+0.65 rmse on istd). the implementation code is available at https://github.com/jeasco/pcformer.",AB_0158
"motion prediction modules are crucial for autonomous vehicles to forecast the future behavior of surrounding road users. failures in prediction modules can mislead a downstream planner to make unsafe decisions. currently, deep learning technology has been widely used to design prediction models due to its impressive performance. however, such models may fail in long-tail driving scenarios where the training data are insufficient or unavailable, which represents the so-called epistemic uncertainty of prediction models. this paper proposes a risk-aware decision-making (radm) framework to handle the epistemic uncertainty arising from training the prediction model on insufficient data. first, a multi-agent prediction network with epistemic uncertainty quantification is proposed. this network uses the historical states of nearby road users, map information, and traffic lights as inputs. then, the radm utilizes model predictive control technique to not only process the multi-agent prediction results but also to consider the epistemic uncertainty of the prediction model. in addition, the accuracy of the established prediction model is verified on real-world driving datasets. furthermore, the proposed radm is evaluated on the log-replay data obtained from real-world driving logs and using the sumo simulator, considering multiple challenging cases where pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles cross the intersection illegally. the experimental results demonstrate that radm can reduce the driving risk and improve driving safety and supplementary videos are provided at https://github.com/sotif-avlab/radm.",AB_0158
"the remaining useful life (rul) prediction of turbofan engines is beneficial to safe operation and maintenance. turbofan engines generally require multisensors to monitor the operational state, but current mainstream rul prediction models tend to ignore the spatial correlations between sensors. although few research has used graph neural networks (gnns) to capture such correlations, there are some limitations in the way the graph structure is determined. to this end, we introduce sensor embeddings and propose a novel rul prediction model based on a convolution-graph attention network (convgat). first, the time-series of every sensor is segmented using a sliding time window and the data within that window is taken as the model input. next, every sensor is treated as a node in the graph. the features of sensor data, which serve as the initial features of the corresponding sensor node, are extracted using a convolutional layer. then, a learnable embedding vector is specially introduced for every sensor and the spatial correlations between sensors are captured using a graph attention network (gat). particularly, the sensor embeddings play an important role in the graph structure learning as well as the graph attention mechanism. finally, the sensor node features output by the gat are fused with the corresponding sensor embeddings and passed through a fully connected layer to predict the rul of turbofan engines. the convgat-based rul prediction model's performance is evaluated using a benchmark dataset regarding turbofan engines, i.e., the c-mapss dataset. the experimental results indicate the superior performance of the proposed model. our code is available at https://github.com/cug-fdgroup.",AB_0158
"the identification of antioxidant proteins is a challenging yet meaningful task, as they can protect against the damage caused by some free radicals. in addition to time-consuming, laborious, and expensive experimental identification methods, efficient identification of antioxidant proteins through machine learning algorithms has become increasingly common. in recent years, researchers have proposed models for identifying antioxidant proteins; unfortunately, although the accuracy of models is already high, their sensitivity is too low, indicating the possibility of overfitting in the model. therefore, we developed a new model called dp-aop for the recognition of antioxidant proteins. we used the smote algorithm to balance the dataset, selected wei's proposed feature extraction algorithm to obtain 473 dimensional feature vectors, and based on the sorting function in mrmd, scored and ranked each feature to obtain a feature set with contribution values ranging from high to low. to effectively reduce the feature dimension, we combined the dynamic programming idea to make the local eight features the optimal subset. after obtaining the 36 dimensional feature vectors, we finally selected 17 features through experimental analysis. the svm classification algorithm was used to implement the model through the libsvm tool. the model achieved satisfactory performance, with an accuracy rate of 91.076 %, sn of 96.4 %, sp of 85.8 %, mcc of 82.6 %, and f1 core of 91.5 %. furthermore, we built a free web server to facilitate researchers' subsequent unfolding studies of antioxidant protein recognition. the website is http:// 112.124.26.17:8003/#/.",AB_0158

"hashing has been widely studied in support of efficient multimedia retrieval due to its high computation and storage efficiency. however, existing multimedia hashing models are designed only for specific multimedia retrieval tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval and composite multi-modal retrieval. to simultaneously support multiple multimedia retrieval tasks, multiple different hashing models should be equipped in a multimedia retrieval system. this paper proposes a structured multi-modal hashing (smmh) method, which can learn only a hash model for multiple multimedia retrieval tasks. specifically, we generate structured hash codes by independently projecting the modality data into the hamming space, where each part of hash codes preserves the specific characteristic of the specific modality data, and they are collaborated to represent the whole multi-modal data. to bridge the heterogeneous gap between multiple modalities, a fusion multi-modal space is constructed based on structured hash codes with label and pair-wise semantic supervision. besides, we learn hash functions for composite multi-modal retrieval by projecting heterogeneous modalities into the collaborative multi-modal features. finally, we develop a discrete hash optimization strategy to efficiently solve binary hash codes. extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the strong baseline methods on multiple multimedia retrieval tasks. source codes are available at https://github.com/chaoqunzheng/smmh.",AB_0158
"crosslinked network polymers have numerous important applications in engineering, biomedicine, and the environment. establishing a crosslinked polymer network is an essential initial step toward studying the structure and function of polymer membranes. in this study, we developed a python script named pxlink that integrates with gromacs software to simulate the crosslinked aromatic polyamide (pa) membrane, which is widely used in desalination and water treatment. pxlink can create chemical bonds between the neighboring carboxyl and amine groups and relax the system during the crosslinking, utilizing energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations implemented in gromacs. the accuracy of our protocol has been successfully validated through a benchmark study of water diffusivity and the structural properties of a solvated membrane, including pore size distribution, membrane density, and the stacking of aromatic benzene rings (density profile and ordering). moreover, the comparison between the dry and wet polymer membranes reveals that the swelling of the membrane surface leads to the expansion of subnanopores and the increased ordering of local structures. after the swelling of the membrane, the number of pores with a radius around the main region of 0.2 nm decreases, while more pores in the range of 0.22-0.38 nm are observed. there is also an increase in the orderliness of local structures, as evidenced by the increasing order parameter of aromatic ring pairs with a distance ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 nm. our developed script will be a valuable tool for designing and discovering crosslinked polymers.program summaryprogram title: pxlink cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /yjw2ghfzmh .1 developer's repository link: https://github .com /zchinet30 /pxlink licensing provisions: gnu general public license 3programming language: python nature of problem: the formation of a crosslinked polymer network is essential for theoretical studies and numerous practical applications. however, simulating the polymer crosslinking process using conventional molecular dynamic simulations presents challenges due to its intricate nature, which involves a complex interplay of physical processes and chemical reactions within a large-scale system.solution method: to address this limitation, we developed pxlink, a python-based script, which integrates with the molecular dynamics software of gromacs for the simulation of polymer crosslinking.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0158

"the research on universal adversarial perturbations (uaps) is significant to trustworthy deep learning. to disentangle the uaps with the training data dependency and the target model dependency, the exploration of procedural noise functions is a feasible method. however, the current procedural adversarial noise attack method has several characteristics like visually significant anisotropy and gradient artifacts that may impact the stealthiness of adversarial examples. this study proposes a novel model-free and data-free uap method based on the procedural noise functions with two variants: simplex noise attack and worley noise attack. the attack method can achieve deceit on the neural networks with a more aesthetic rendering effect. a detailed empirical study is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed attack method. the extensive experiments show that the uaps generated by the proposed method achieve considerable attack performance on the imagenet dataset and the cifar-10 dataset. moreover, this study implements the performance evaluation and robustness analysis of existing defense methods against the proposed uaps. it has the potential to enhance research on the robustness of neural networks in real applications. the code is available at https://github.com/momo1986/adversarial_example_simplex_worley.",AB_0158
"lane detection is critical for intelligent vehicles to sense drivable areas. compared to general objects, lane lines are slender-shaped, easily occluded, or defaced. therefore, the lane detection network requires a more robust ability for local detail extraction and global semantic information modeling. in this paper, we propose a novel lane detection network (flamnet) with a flexible line anchor mechanism, which constantly corrects the position of line anchors to improve detection performance and computational efficiency. specifically, we utilize the patch pooling aggregation module (ppam) to aggregate multi-scale semantic features extracted by the backbone network. the multi-scale features are subsequently inputted into dsaformer, which utilizes decomposed self-attention to establish global long-distance dependencies. the detection head leverages fused features of multi-scale global and local details to accurately fit the lane line by correcting the anchor position. moreover, we propose the horizontal information aggregation module (hiam) to expand the receptive field of line anchors horizontally, enhancing the line anchor representation ability to the topological structure of complex lane lines. the experimental results on mainstream lane detection benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed flamnet outperforms existing methods. we have uploaded the code and demo of flamnet on github at: https://github.com/ ranhao-cq/flamnet.",AB_0158
