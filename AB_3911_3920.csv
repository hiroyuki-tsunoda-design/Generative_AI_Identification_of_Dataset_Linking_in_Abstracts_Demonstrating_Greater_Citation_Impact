"background: e-sports require athletes to have high-speed reflexes and excellent memory skills. whereas a single session of aerobic exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, this paper aims is to investigate the effects of acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on the cognitive function of e-sports players and its time-course characteristics.methods: thirty-four e-athletes were divided into 2 groups according to a random number table method, and 2 trials in a quiet physical fitness gym. the duration of each trial was approximately 1 hour. in the first trial: exercise group (64-76% of maximum heart rate for 30 minutes power cycling) and control group, cognitive function was tested, and results were automatically recorded before, immediately after, and 30 minutes after exercise using the human benchmark website (https://humanbenchmark.com). the second trial crossed and swapped the interventions of the 2 groups, and the other test protocols were the same as the first.results: in both trials, the exercise intervention group showed significant improvements in speed accuracy (p < .001, cohen's d = 1.406, 95% ci: 0.717-2.072; p = .005, cohen's d = 0.782, 95% ci: 0.227-1.319), visual memory (p < .001, cohen's d = 1.416, 95% ci: 0.725-2.086; p = .015, cohen's d = 0.662, 95% ci: 0.127-1.181), and reaction time (p < .001, cohen's d = 1.265, 95% ci: 0.610-1.898; p<.001, cohen's d = 0.979, 95% ci: 0.386-1.551) immediately after exercise compared to baseline. the exercise intervention group also showed significant improvement in speed accuracy 30 minutes after exercise compared to baseline (p = .002 cohen's d = 0.869, 95% ci: 0.298-1.421; p = .009, cohen's d = 0.722, 95% ci: 0.177-1.249). in the first trial, the exercise intervention group showed significant improvements in visual memory and reaction time immediately after exercise compared to the control group (p = .013, cohen's d = 0.904, 95% ci: 0.190-1.605; p = .027, cohen's d = 0.796, 95% ci: 0.090-1.490). the exercise intervention group also showed significant improvement in reaction time 30 minutes after exercise compared to baseline (p = .009, cohen's d = 0.719, 95% ci: 0.174-1.246). there was no effect of exercise on sequence memory or the chimp test in both trials (p > .05). sequence effect analysis showed no influence on the order of the exercise intervention in both trials (p = .912; p = .111; p = .226).conclusion: acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise significantly enhanced the speed accuracy, visual reaction time, and instantaneous memory of esports players, and the effect could be extended up to 30 minutes after exercise.",AB_0392
"to investigate the overall survival of post-resection leiomyosarcoma (lms) patients with lung metastasis, data of post-resection lms patients with lung metastasis between 2010 and 2016 were extracted from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database. the clinical characteristics and survival data for post-resection lms patients with lung metastasis at tianjin medical university cancer hospital & institute (tjmuch) between october 2010 and july 2018 were collected. patients derived from the seer database and tjmuch were divided into training and validation cohorts, respectively. univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were performed and a nomogram was established. the area under the curve (auc) and the calibration curve were used to evaluate the nomogram. a web-based nomogram was developed based on the established nomogram. eventually, 226 patients from the seer database who were diagnosed with lms and underwent primary lesion resection combined with lung metastasis were enrolled in the training cohort, and 17 patients from tjmuch were enrolled in the validation cohort. sex, race, grade, tumor size, chemotherapy, and bone metastasis were correlated with overall survival in patients with lms. the c-index were 0.65 and 0.75 in the seer and chinese set, respectively. furthermore, the applicable auc values of the roc curve in the seer cohort to predict the 1-, 3-, 5- years survival rate were 0.646, 0.682, and 0.689, respectively. the corresponding auc values in the chinese cohort were 0.970, 0.913, and 0.881, respectively. the calibration curve showed that the nomogram performed well in predicting the overall survival in post-resection lms patients with lung metastasis. a web-based nomogram (https://weijunqiang.shinyapps.io/survival_lms_lungmet/) was established. the web-based nomogram (https://weijunqiang.shinyapps.io/survival_lms_lungmet/) is an accurate and personalized tool for predicting the overall survival of post-resection lms with lung metastasis.",AB_0392
"we present the the new swift/uvot+manga (swim) catalog (swim_v4.1). swim_v4.1 is designed to study star formation and dust attenuation within nearby galaxies given the unique overlap of swift/uvot near-ultraviolet (nuv) imaging and manga integral field optical spectroscopy. swim_v4.1 comprises 559 objects, similar to 4 times more than the original swim catalog (swim_v3.1), spans the redshift range z approximate to 0.0002-0.1482, and provides a more diverse and rich sample. approximately 5% of the final manga sample is included in swim_v4.1, and 42% of the swim_v4.1 galaxies are cross-listed with other well-known catalogs. we present the same data as swim_v3.1, including uvot images, sloan digital sky survey (sdss) images, and manga emission-line and spectral index maps with the same pixel size and angular resolution for each galaxy, and a file containing galaxy and observational properties. we designed swim_v4.1 to be unbiased, which resulted in some objects having low signal-to-noise ratios in their manga or swift data. we addressed this by providing a new file containing the fraction of science-ready pixels in each manga emission-line map, and the integrated flux and inverse variance for all three nuv filters. the uniform angular resolution and sampling in swim_v4.1 will help answer a number of scientific questions, including constraining quenching and attenuation in the local universe and studying the effects of black hole feedback. the galaxy maps, catalog files, and their associated data models are publicly released on the sdss website (a description of the swim vac is provided at https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/data_access/value-added-catalogs/?vac_id=swift-manga-value-added-catalog, and the data are stored on the sdss science archive server at https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr17/manga/swim/v4.1/).",AB_0392
"introductionin 2019, smoking prevalence in north macedonia was one of the world's highest at around 46% in adults. however, access to smoking cessation treatment is limited and no co-ordinated smoking cessation programmes are provided in primary care.methodswe conducted a three parallel-armed randomised controlled trial (n = 1368) to investigate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of lung age (la) or exhaled carbon monoxide (co) feedback combined with very brief advice (vba) to prompt smoking cessation compared with vba alone, delivered by gps in primary care in north macedonia. all participants who decided to attempt to quit smoking were advised about accessing smoking cessation medications and were also offered behavioural support as part of the act component of vba. participants were aged >= 35 years, smoked >= 10 cigarettes per day, were recruited from 31 gp practices regardless of motivation to quit and were randomised (1:1:1) using a sequence generated before the start of recruitment. the primary outcome was biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks (wks). participants and gps were not blinded to allocation after randomisation, however outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation.resultsthere was no evidence of a difference in biochemically confirmed quitting between intervention and control at 4wks (vba + la rr 0.90 (97.5%ci: 0.35, 2.27); vba + co rr 1.04 (97.5%ci: 0.44, 2.44)), however the absolute number of quitters was small (vba + la 1.6%, vba + co 1.8%, vba 1.8%). a similar lack of effect was observed at 12 and 26wks, apart from in the vba + la arm where the point estimate was significant but the confidence intervals were very wide. in both treatment arms, a larger proportion reported a reduction in cigarettes smoked per day at 4wks (vba + la 1.30 (1.10, 1.54); vba + co 1.23 (1.03, 1.49)) compared with vba. the point estimates indicated a similar direction of effect at 12wks and 26wks, but differences were not statistically significant. quantitative process measures indicated high fidelity to the intervention delivery protocols, but low uptake of behavioural and pharmacological support. vba was the dominant intervention in the health economic analyses.conclusionoverall, there was no evidence that adding la or co to vba increased quit rates. however, a small effect cannot be ruled out as the proportion quitting was low and therefore estimates were imprecise. there was some evidence that participants in the intervention arms were more likely to reduce the amount smoked, at least in the short term. more research is needed to find effective ways to support quitting in settings like north macedonia where a strong smoking culture persists.trial registrationthe trial was registered at http://www.isrctn.com (isrctn54228638) on the 07/09/2018.",AB_0392

"with the increasing throughput of modern sequencing instruments, the cost of storing and transmitting sequencing data has also increased dramatically. although many tools have been developed to compress sequencing data, there is still a need to develop a compressor with a higher compression ratio. we present a two-step framework for compressing sequencing data in this paper. the first step is to repack original data into a binary stream, while the second step is to compress the stream with a lzma encoder. we develop a new strategy to encode the original file into a lzma highly compressed stream. in addition an fpga-accelerated of lzma was implemented to speedup the second step. as a demonstration, we present repaq as a lossless non-reference compressor of fastq format files. we introduced a multifile redundancy elimination method, which is very useful for compressing paired-end sequencing data. according to our test results, the compression ratio of repaq is much higher than other fastq compressors. for some deep sequencing data, the compression ratio of repaq can be higher than 25, almost four times of gzip. the framework presented in this paper can also be applied to develop new tools for compressing other sequencing data. the open-source code of repaq is available at: https://github.com/opengene/repaq.",AB_0392
"backgroundcoronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a rapidly developing and sometimes lethal pulmonary disease. accurately predicting covid-19 mortality will facilitate optimal patient treatment and medical resource deployment, but the clinical practice still needs to address it. both complete blood counts and cytokine levels were observed to be modified by covid-19 infection. this study aimed to use inexpensive and easily accessible complete blood counts to build an accurate covid-19 mortality prediction model. the cytokine fluctuations reflect the inflammatory storm induced by covid-19, but their levels are not as commonly accessible as complete blood counts. therefore, this study explored the possibility of predicting cytokine levels based on complete blood counts.methodswe used complete blood counts to predict cytokine levels. the predictive model includes an autoencoder, principal component analysis, and linear regression models. we used classifiers such as support vector machine and feature selection models such as adaptive boost to predict the mortality of covid-19 patients.resultscomplete blood counts and original cytokine levels reached the covid-19 mortality classification area under the curve (auc) values of 0.9678 and 0.9111, respectively, and the cytokine levels predicted by the feature set alone reached the classification auc value of 0.9844. the predicted cytokine levels were more significantly associated with covid-19 mortality than the original values.conclusionsintegrating the predicted cytokine levels and complete blood counts improved a covid-19 mortality prediction model using complete blood counts only. both the cytokine level prediction models and the covid-19 mortality prediction models are publicly available at http://www.healthinformaticslab.org/supp/resources.php.",AB_0392
"objective: this study aimed to use network pharmacology to predict the therapeutic mechanism of oroxyli semen (os) on triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc) and validate it through in vitro experiments.methods: the active ingredients and target proteins of os were retrieved from the traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology database, and the tnbc-related target genes were obtained from the genecards database. the overlapping genes were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (ppi) network via the string database. furthermore, we employed an online bioinformatics analysis platform (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/) to perform gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analyses to evaluate biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components and generate simulated signal pathways. additionally, molecular docking was used to evaluate the binding ability of small molecule drugs and signaling pathway targets. cck8 assay was conducted to detect the effect of small molecule drugs on tnbc cell viability, and western blot was utilized to verify the expression of akt, vegf, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (hif-1 alpha) proteins.results: fifteen active ingredients and 166 therapeutic targets of os were obtained from the traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology database. the venn diagram revealed that 163 targets were related to tnbc. the protein-protein interaction network analysis identified akt1, il-6, jun, vascular endothelial growth factor a (vegfa), casp3, and hif-1 alpha as potential core targets through which os may treat tnbc. furthermore, the molecular docking results indicated that the active ingredient chryseriol in os had good binding ability with vegfa, and hif-1 alpha. cck8 assay results indicated that chryseriol inhibited the viability of mda-mb-231 and bt-20 cells. western blot demonstrated that chryseriol intervention led to a decrease in vegfa, and hif-1 alpha protein expression compared with the control group (p < .05), increased the cleaved parp.conclusion: os may exert its therapeutic effects on tnbc through multiple cellular signaling pathways. chryseriol, the active component of os, can enhance the apoptosis of tnbc cells by targeting vegfa/hif-1 alpha pathway. this study provided new insights into the potential therapeutic mechanism of os for tnbc and may aid in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for tnbc.",AB_0392
"pneumothorax is a potentially fatal complication in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), presenting challenges in determining the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (peep) level to prevent atelectasis without exacerbating the pneumothorax. this case report describes the successful application of transpulmonary pressure and electrical impedance tomography (eit) at the bedside to guide peep selection in a patient with ards complicated by pneumothorax due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection. by using minimal peep to maintain positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure and visualizing lung reopening with eit, the optimal peep level was reaffirmed, even if traditionally considered high. the patient's condition improved, and successful weaning from the ventilator was achieved, leading to a transfer out of the intensive care unit.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct04081142, identifier nct04081142.",AB_0392
"gravity is the driving force of star formation. although gravity is caused by the presence of matter, its role in complex regions is still unsettled. one effective way to study the pattern of gravity is to compute the accretion it exerts on the gas by providing gravitational acceleration maps. a practical way to study acceleration is by computing it using 2d surface density maps, yet whether these maps are accurate remains uncertain. using numerical simulations, we confirm that the accuracy of the acceleration maps a 2d(x, y) computed from 2d surface density are good representations for the mean acceleration weighted by mass. due to the underestimations of the distances from projected maps, the magnitudes of accelerations will be overestimated vertical bar a(2d) (x, y)vertical bar approximate to 2.3 +/- 1.8 vertical bar a(3d)(proj) (x, y)vertical bar, where a(3d)(proj) (x, y) is mass-weighted projected gravitational acceleration, yet a(2d)(x, y) and a(3d)(proj) (x, y) stay aligned within 20 degrees. significant deviations only occur in regions where multiple structures are present along the line of sight. the acceleration maps estimated from surface density provide good descriptions of the projection of 3d acceleration fields. we expect this technique useful in establishing the link between cloud morphology and star formation, and in understanding the link between gravity and other processes such as the magnetic field. a version of the code for calculating surface density gravitational potential is available at https://github.com/zhenzhen-research/phi_2d.",AB_0392
