"background: generalized anxiety disorder (gad) is common among perimenopausal women. acupuncture may be an effective treatment for gad, but evidence is limited. the pathogenesis of gad is not yet clear, but it is related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and its excretion, cortisol (cort), and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth). the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of manual acupuncture (ma) vs. placebo acupuncture (pa) for perimenopausal women with gad.methods: this study is a single-center, randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted in the first affiliated hospital of guangzhou university of chinese medicine. a total of 112 eligible patients with gad were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ma (n = 56) or pa (n = 56) three times per week for 4 weeks. the primary outcome measure was the hama score. the secondary outcome measures were the gad-7 and psqi scores and the levels of cort and acth. the evaluation will be executed at the baseline, 2 weeks, the end of the treatment, and a follow-up 3-month period.results: significant improvements in hama (p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.465), gad-7 (p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.359) and acth (p = 0.050) values were found between t-0 and t-2 in the ma group compared to the pa group. no difference in psqi (p = 0.613, eta(2)(p) = 0.011) and cort (p = 0.903) was found between t-0 and t-2 in the ma group compared to the pa group. long-term improvements in hama (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) were found in the ma group and pa group.conclusion: this study was the first completed study to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture for gad in perimenopausal patients. results suggested that placebo acupuncture has a therapeutic effect, however, acupuncture had a greater therapeutic effect than placebo acupuncture. this study supports the effectiveness of acupuncture and thereby contributes to extended treatment options for gad. clinical trial registration:http://www.chictr.org.cn, chinese clinical trial registry, id: chictr2100046604. registered on 22 may 2021.conclusion this study was the first completed study to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture for gad in perimenopausal patients. results suggested that placebo acupuncture has a therapeutic effect, however, acupuncture had a greater therapeutic effect than placebo acupuncture. this study supports the effectiveness of acupuncture and thereby contributes to extended treatment options for gad.",AB_0140
"purposethis study aims to investigate the surface modification on 20crmnti gear steel individually treated by diamond-like carbon films and nitride coatings.design/methodology/approachfor this purpose, the mechanical properties of a-c:h, ta-c and alcrsin coatings are characterized by nano-indentation and scratch tests. the friction and wear behaviors of these three coatings are evaluated by ball-on-disc tribological experiments under dry contact conditions.findingsthe results show that the a-c:h coating has the highest coating-substrate adhesion strength (495 mn) and the smoothest surface (ra is about 0.045 & mu;m) compared with the other two coatings. the alcrsin coating shows the highest mean coefficient of friction (cof), whereas the ta-c coating exhibits the lowest one (steady at about 0.16). the carbon-based coatings possess excellent self-lubricating properties compared with nitride ceramic ones, which effectively reduce the cof by about 64%. the major failure mode of carbon-based coatings in dry contact is slight abrasive wear. the damage of alcrsin coating is mainly adhesive wear and abrasive wear.originality/valueit is suggested that the carbon-based film can effectively improve the friction-reducing and wear resistance performance of the gear steel surface, which has a promising application prospect in the mechanical transmission field.peer reviewthe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-05-2023-0129/",AB_0140
"with the development of deep learning, almost all single-domain proteins can be predicted at experimental resolution. however, the structure prediction of multi-domain proteins remains a challenge. achieving end-to-end protein domain assembly and further improving the accuracy of the full-chain modeling by accurately predicting inter-domain orientation while improving the assembly efficiency will provide significant insights into structure-based drug discovery. in this work, we propose an end-to-end domain assembly method based on deep learning, named e2eda. we first develop rmnet, an efficientnetv2-based deep learning model that fuses multiple features using an attention mechanism to predict inter-domain rigid motion. then, the predicted rigid motions are transformed into inter-domain spatial transformations to directly assemble the full-chain model. finally, the scoring strategy rmscore is designed to select the best model from multiple assembled models. the experimental results show that the average tm-score of the model assembled by e2eda on the benchmark set (282) is 0.827, which is better than those of other domain assembly methods sada (0.792) and demo (0.730). meanwhile, on our constructed multi-domain data set from alphafold db, the model reassembled by e2eda is 7.0% higher in tm-score compared to the full-chain model predicted by alphafold2, indicating that e2eda can capture more accurate inter-domain orientations to improve the quality of the model predicted by alphafold2. furthermore, compared to sada and alphafold2, e2eda reduced the average runtime on the benchmark by 64.7% and 19.2%, respectively, indicating that e2eda can significantly improve assembly efficiency through an end-to-end approach. the online server is available at http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/e2eda.",AB_0140
"backgroundelevated hscrp (high-sensitivity c-reactive protein) level is associated with worse prognosis among patients hospitalized for heart failure. however, the prognostic value of the long-term cumulative hscrp remains unknown.methods and resultswe consecutively enrolled patients hospitalized for heart failure and collected their hscrp data at admission and 1 and 12 months after discharge. long-term cumulative hscrp was evaluated using 2 approaches, cumulative hscrp level quartiles and cumulative times of high hscrp levels. patients were classified into 4 groups by cumulative hscrp level quartiles and cumulative times of high hscrp levels (0- to 3-times: number of times that hscrp levels were higher than cutoff values at admission or 1 or 12 months), respectively. multivariable cox models were used to assess the association of mortality with cumulative hscrp. a total of 1281 patients were included; the median age was 64 (interquartile range, 54-73) years, and 35.4% were women. over a 4.8-year (interquartile range, 4.2-5.1) follow-up, 374 (29.2%) patients died. elevated long-term cumulative hscrp level was related to higher mortality. specifically, taking the quartile 1 as the reference, the hazard ratios (hrs) were 1.29 (95% ci, 0.92-1.81) for quartile 2, 1.62 (95% ci, 1.16-2.25) for quartile 3, and 2.38 (95% ci, 1.75-3.23) for quartile 4. similarly, compared with the patients with 0-times (hscrp level lower than the cutoff values in all 3 time points) of high hscrp level, the hrs were 1.36 for 1-time (hscrp level higher than the cutoff value in one of the 3 time points) (95% ci, 0.92-2.01), 1.95 for 2-times (hscrp levels higher than the cutoff values in 2 of the 3 time points) (95% ci, 1.34-2.82), and 2.80 for 3-times (hscrp levels higher than the cutoff values in the 3 time points) (95% ci, 1.97-4.00).conclusionsincreasing long-term cumulative hscrp level was associated with worse outcomes in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure. repeated hscrp measurements could assist physicians in identifying patients with a high risk of death.registrationurl: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct 02878811.",AB_0140
"dna n6-methyladenine (6ma) is one of the most common and abundant modifications, which plays essential roles in various biological processes and cellular functions. therefore, the accurate identification of dna 6ma sites is of great importance for a better understanding of its regulatory mechanisms and biological functions. although significant progress has been made, there still has room for further improvement in 6ma site prediction in dna sequences. in this study, we report a smart but accurate 6ma predictor, termed as snn6ma, using siamese network. to be specific, dna segments are firstly encoded into feature vectors using the one-hot encoding scheme; then, these original feature vectors are mapped to a low-dimensional embedding space derived from siamese network to capture more discriminative features; finally, the obtained low-dimensional features are fed to a fully connected neural network to perform final prediction. stringent benchmarking tests on the datasets of two species demonstrated that the proposed snn6ma is superior to the state-of-the-art 6ma predictors. detailed data analyses show that the major advantage of snn6ma lies in the utilization of siamese network, which can map the original features into a low-dimensional embedding space with more discriminative capability. in summary, the proposed snn6ma is the first attempt to use siamese network for 6ma site prediction and could be easily extended to predict other types of modifications. the codes and datasets used in the study are freely available at https://github.com/yuxuan-glasgow/snn6ma for academic use.",AB_0140
"backgroundlymph node (ln) metastasis is the most common metastasis route in gastric cancer. extensive dissection of lns can significantly improve the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. recently, multiple clinical studies have demonstrated that either indocyanine green (icg) or carbon nanoparticles (cns) can assist to promote the dissection of lns during laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. considering the pros and cons of the two tracers, this study proposed a novel method of dual tracer (icg combined with cns) for lymphatic tracing in laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery.methodsthis trial is a prospective, randomized controlled trial (rct) with an estimation of 516 participants that randomize into 4 groups (1:1:1:1), namely control group, icg group, cns group, and dual tracer group. the primary outcome is the number of dissected lns. the secondary outcomes include positive rate, false positive rate, negative rate, false negative rate, number of metastatic lns, relationship between ln metastasis and tracer stained, operation duration, blood loss, incision length, morbidity and mortality rate, 3-year dfs (disease free survival), pfs (progression-free survival), and os (overall survival).discussionthis study will investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel strategy using dual tracers for laparoscopic gastrectomy. the protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of nanjing drum tower hospital (2021-361-02). the trial findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals.trial registrationchinese clinical trial registry (chictr2100051309). registered 18 september 2021, https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=133764.",AB_0140
"background: various electrocardiographic (ecg) abnormalities are associated with the severity of pulmonary thromboembolism (pte). the utility of evaluating the clot burden of pte based on ecg findings alone has yet to be thoroughly investigated in chinese patients. the aim of this study was therefore to use ecg signs to establish novel models for quantitative and localization analysis of clot burden in patients with acute pte. methods: acute pte patients from three centers were enrolled between 2015 and 2019 in a retrospective cohort study (nct03802929). we analyzed the 12-lead ecgs at admission and studied computed tomography pulmonary angiography (ctpa) features to obtain the qanadli score of clot burden and location of thrombus. novel risk prediction models were developed and validated using derivation and external validation cohorts, respectively. results: a total of 341 acute pte patients were screened, of whom 246 (72.1%) were from shanghai tenth people's hospital, 71 (20.8%) were from shanghai pulmonary hospital and 24 (7.0%) were from qidong people's hospital. in the derivation cohort, predictors included in the final models were congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and ecg abnormalities. the charis (copd/chf/chd, htn, atrial arrhythmias/af, rbbb/rad, inverted t wave and s1q3t3/ sinus tachycardia) i model was established for quantitatively assessing qanadli score. it had moderate discrimination in both the derivation cohort (concordance index (c-index) of 0.720, 95% ci 0.655-0.780) and the validation cohort (c-index of 0.663, 95% ci 0.559-0.757). the charis ii model was used to predict the probability of trunk obstruction. it showed similar discrimination in the derivation cohort (c-index of 0.753, 95% ci 0.691-0.811) and in the validation cohort (c-index of 0.741, 95% ci 0.641-0.827). calibration curves and hosmer-lemeshow test confirmed the accuracy of the risk prediction equations in the external validation dataset. decision curve analysis showed the charis i and charis ii algorithms had positive net benefits in both the derivation and validation cohorts. conclusions: from quantitative and localization perspectives, the charis algorithms can identify acute pte patients with heavy thrombus burdens prior to imaging diagnosis. clinical trial registration: nct03802929, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/nct03802929.",AB_0140
"background: coronary heart disease is one of the main causes of mortality. many biological indicators have been used to predict the prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease. the ratio of serum globulin to albumin (gar) has been used to predict the prognosis of patients with various cancers. it has been proven that gar is related to the prognosis of patients with stroke. however, gar's role in cardiovascular disease remains unclear. our purpose was to investigate the predictive value of gar on clinical outcomes in postpercutaneous coronary intervention (pci) patients with coronary artery disease (cad). methods: from dec. 2016 to oct. 2021, a total of 14,994 patients undergoing pci patients admitted to the first affiliated hospital of xinjiang medical university were divided into high gar group (gar >= 0.76, n = 4087) and low gar group (gar <0.76, n = 10,907). the incidence of adverse outcomes including all-cause mortality (acm), cardiovascular mortality (cm), major adverse cardiovascular events (mace) and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (macce) was compared between the two groups. multivariate cox regression was used to adjust for the effects of confounding factors, while hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% ci) were calculated. median follow-up time was 24 months. results: compared with the low gar group, the high gar group had significantly higher incidence of acm (6.5% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001); cm (4.9% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.001), mace (10.5% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), and macce (11.3% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001). cox regression analysis showed the patients in the high gar group had a 1.62-fold increased risk for acm (hr = 2.622, 95% ci: 2.130-3.228, p < 0.01), a 1.782-fold increased risk for cm (hr = 2.782, 95% ci: 2.180-3.550, p < 0.01). there was a 37.2% increased risk for mace (hr = 1.372, 95% ci: 1.204-1.564, p < 0.01), and 32.4% increased risk for macce (hr = 1.324, 95% ci: 1.169-1.500, p < 0.01), compared to the patients in the low gar group. conclusions: the present study suggested that post-pci cad patients with higher gar presented significantly increased mortality and adverse events gar level at admission may 296 be considered as part of risk stratification when pci is possible in patients with coronary heart disease. clinical trial registration: the detailed information of the practice study has been registered on http://clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: nct05174143).",AB_0140
"background:accuracy of preoperative t staging for colon cancer remains disappointing. objective:this study aimed to propose specially designed radiological staging criteria based on membrane anatomy and visceral adipose tissue and compare the staging performance with the routinely used method. design:this is a prospective observational study. setting:this study was conducted at a high-volume colorectal center. participants:consecutive patients with colonoscopy-proven colon carcinoma referred for clinical staging and elective resection were enrolled. intervention:the preoperative ct data were separately reviewed by 2 teams of radiologists for assigning t-stage categories (t1-2, t3, or t4) using the routine staging method or the newly proposed radiological criteria. measures:diagnostic performance for t staging was compared between the 2 criteria. results:between october 2019 and august 2020, 190 patients were included. compared with pathological results, t stage was correctly determined in 113 of 190 patients (59.5%) with the conventional ct criteria. with the newly developed criteria, 160 patients (84.2%) were found to be correctly staged. accuracies between the 2 criteria significantly differed (p < 0.001). for t1-2 staging, there were no significant differences between the sensitivities of conventional and new criteria (57.1% vs 61.9%; p = 0.990) or between their specificities (95.3% vs 98.2%; p = 0.131). however, for t3 and t4 staging, the newly developed ct criteria exhibited significantly higher sensitivity (t3: 85.2% vs 57.4%; p < 0.001; t4: 90.7% vs 64.8%; p < 0.001) and specificity (t3: 82.7% vs 64%; p = 0.006; t4: 89.7% vs 69.1%; p < 0.001) than the conventional criteria. moreover, the new criteria (area under the curve = 0.902) performed significantly better than the conventional criteria (area under the curve = 0.670; p < 0.001), for identifying the t4-stage tumor. limitations:the limitations are that it is a single-center study and there was no external validation. conclusions:the specially designed radiological criteria can offer more accurate t staging than the routine method in colon cancer. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b992.",AB_0140
