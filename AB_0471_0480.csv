"a fast-growing body of evidence from experience sampling studies suggests that affect dynamics are associated with well-being and health. but heterogeneity in experience sampling approaches impedes reproducibility and scientific progress. leveraging a large dataset of 7016 individuals, each providing over 50 affect reports, we introduce an empirically derived framework to help researchers design well-powered and efficient experience sampling studies. our research reveals three general principles. first, a sample of 200 participants and 20 observations per person yields sufficient power to detect medium-sized associations for most affect dynamic measures. second, for trait-and time-independent variability measures of affect (e.g., sd), distant sampling study designs (i.e., a few daily measurements spread out over several weeks) lead to more accurate estimates than close sampling study designs (i.e., many daily measurements concentrated over a few days), although differences in accuracy across sampling methods were inconsistent and of little practical significance for temporally dependent affect dynamic measures (i.e., rmssd, autocorrelation coefficient, tkeo, and pac). third, across all affect dynamics measures, sampling exclusively on specific days or time windows leads to little to no improvement over sampling at random times. because the ideal sampling approach varies for each affect dynamics measure, we provide a companion r package, an online calculator (https://sergiopirla.shinyapps.io/poweradapp), and a series of benchmark effect sizes to help researchers address three fundamental hows of experience sampling: how many participants to recruit? how often to solicit them? and for how long?",AB_0048
"the increase of available large clinical and experimental datasets has contributed to a substantial amount of important contributions in the area of biomedical image analysis. image segmentation, which is crucial for any quantitative analysis, has especially attracted attention. recent hardware advancement has led to the success of deep learning approaches. however, although deep learning models are being trained on large datasets, existing methods do not use the information from different learning epochs effectively. in this work, we leverage the information of each training epoch to prune the prediction maps of the subsequent epochs. we propose a novel architecture called feedback attention network (fanet) that unifies the previous epoch mask with the feature map of the current training epoch. the previous epoch mask is then used to provide hard attention to the learned feature maps at different convolutional layers. the network also allows rectifying the predictions in an iterative fashion during the test time. we show that our proposed feedback attention model provides a substantial improvement on most segmentation metrics tested on seven publicly available biomedical imaging datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of fanet. the source code is available at https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/fanet.",AB_0048
"vegetation indices computed from spectral signatures are vastly used for monitoring the terrestrial biosphere. indices are convenient proxies for canopy structure, and leaf pigment content, and consequently to estimate the photosynthetic activity of vegetation. owing to its simplicity, the celebrated normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) has been used as a proxy for greenness and canopy structure. unfortunately, ndvi can only capture linear relationships of the near infrared (nir) -red difference with the parameter of interest. to account for higher-order relations between the spectral channels, kernel ndvi (kndvi) was proposed in (camps-valls et al., 2021). in this work, we give useful prescriptions for its proper use and show its good performance in a wider set of applications. we discuss the good characteristics of the index like boundedness, low error propagation. furthermore, we give empirical evidence of performance in estimating in-situ vegetation parameters (leaf area index (lai), gross primary productivity (gpp), leaf, and canopy chlorophyll content, green and total lai and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fapar)) as well as the estimation of latent heat at flux tower level. we confirm the generally good performance of the index (correlation coefficient of kndvi and canopy chlorophyll content is 0.919 and 0.933 for maize over two sites, as well as the correlation coefficient between kndvi and carotenoid, is 0.816, 0.520 and 0.579 for three forest sites) and highlight its convenience in monitoring terrestrial ecosystems. to foster wider adoption of the new family of the index, we provide source code in 6 programming languages as well as efficient implementations in the google earth engine (gee) platform at https://github.com/ipl-uv/kndvi.",AB_0048
"background: secondary use of health data is a valuable source of knowledge that boosts observational studies, leading to important discoveries in the medical and biomedical sciences. the fundamental guiding principle for performing a successful observational study is the research question and the approach in advance of executing a study. however, in multi-centre studies, finding suitable datasets to support the study is challenging, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible without a deep understanding of each dataset.methods: we propose a strategy for retrieving biomedical datasets of interest that were semantically annotated, using an interface built by applying a methodology for transforming natural language questions into formal language queries. the advantages of creating biomedical semantic data are enhanced by using natural language interfaces to issue complex queries without manipulating a logical query language.results: our methodology was validated using alzheimer's disease datasets published in a european platform for sharing and reusing biomedical data. we converted data to semantic information format using biomedical on-tologies in everyday use in the biomedical community and published it as a fair endpoint. we have considered natural language questions of three types: single-concept questions, questions with exclusion criteria, and multi-concept questions. finally, we analysed the performance of the question-answering module we used and its limitations. the source code is publicly available at https:// bioinformatics-ua.github.io/biokbqa/.conclusion: we propose a strategy for using information extracted from biomedical data and transformed into a semantic format using open biomedical ontologies. our method uses natural language to formulate questions to be answered by this semantic data without the direct use of formal query languages.",AB_0048
"accurate prediction of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) modifications is essential to explore and discern the process of cell differentiation, gene expression and epigenetic regulation. several computational approaches have been proposed for particular type -specific dna modification prediction. rilvo recent generalized computational predictors are capable of detecting three different types of dna modifications; however, type -specific and generalized modifications predictors produce limited performance across multiple species mainly due to the use of ineffective sequence encoding methods. the paper in hand presents a generalized computational approach dna -mp that is competent to more precisely predict three different dna modifications across multiple species. proposed dna mp approach makes use of a powerful encoding method position specific nucleotides occurrence based 117 on modification and non -modification class densities normalized difference (pocd-nd) to generate the statistical representations of dna sequences and a deep forest classifier for modifications prediction. pocd-nd encoder generates statistical representations by extracting position specific distributional information of nucleotides in the dna sequences. we perform a comprehensive intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the proposed encoder and compare its performance with 32 most widely used encoding methods on 17 benchmark dna modifications prediction datasets of 12 different species using 10 different machine learning classifiers. overall, with all classifiers, the proposed pocd-nd encoder outperforms existing 32 different encoders. furthermore, combinedly over 5 -fold cross validation benchmark datasets and independent test sets, proposed dna -mp predictor outperforms state-of-the-art type -specific and generalized modifications predictors by an average accuracy of 7% across 4mc datasets, 1.35% across 5hmc datasets and 10% for 6ma datasets. to facilitate the scientific community, the dna -mp web application is available at https://sds_genetic_analysis.opendfki.de/dna_ modifications/.",AB_0048
"the highly conserved catalytic sites in protein kinases make it difficult to identify atp competitive inhibitors with kinome-wide selectivity. serendipitously, during a dedicated fragment campaign for the focal adhesion kinase (fak), a scaffold that had lost its initial fak affinity showed remarkable potency and selectivity for serine-arginine-protein kinases 1-3 (srpki -3). non-conserved interactions with the uniquely structured hinge region of the srpk family were the key drivers of the exclusive selectivity of the discovered fragment hit. structure-guided medicinal chemistry efforts led to the srpk inhibitor msc-1186, which fulfills all hallmarks of a reversible chemical probe, including nanomolar cellular potency and excellent kinome-wide selectivity. the combination of msc-1186 with cdc2-like kinase (clk) inhibitors showed additive attenuation of sr-protein phosphorylation compared to the single agents. msc-1186 and negative control (msc-5360) are chemical probes available via the structural genomics consortium chemical probe program (https://www,sgc-ffm.uni-frankfurt.de/).",AB_0048
"an original pathway to renewable production of phenol-rich bio-oil by fast pyrolysis of pretreated olive pomace (op) was researched. however, inherent inorganic elements (especially alkali and alkaline earth metals) in biomass feedstocks largely modified the final bio-oil composition. to alter their catalytic activity in fast pyrolysis, different de-mineralisation processes (water, acid and alkali pretreatments) were employed. there was also an in-depth study of bio-oil phenolic compounds, analysing the oxygen -con-taining substituted groups linked to the benzene ring. from water leached samples, po-tassium was largely removed, enhancing the selective production of guaiacol (at room temperature) and syringol (at t = 90 c). important differences were observed with hcl and hno3 pretreatments regarding carboxylic acid and phenolic distribution. for pre-treatment with naoh, the sodium content in the sample was observed to increase to 83%. thus, optimal phenolic selectivity (36.9%) was achieved for the alkali pretreated op sample, where guaiacol (5.9%) and vinyl guaiacol (6.2%) yields increased and methyl guaiacol decreased. this study marks an efficient and clean pathway for converting agricultural waste into valuable phenolic enriched bio-oil. this could constitute a new way of obtaining these compounds by using renewable agriculture biomass.(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd on behalf of institution of chemical engineers. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0048
"in this work we address the challenging case of answering count queries in web search, such as number of songs by john lennon. prior methods merely answer these with a single, and sometimes puzzling number or return a ranked list of text snippets with different numbers. this paper proposes a methodology for answering count queries with inference, contextualization and explanatory evidence. unlike previous systems, our method infers final answers from multiple observations, supports semantic qualifiers for the counts, and provides evidence by enumerating representative instances. experiments with a wide variety of queries, including existing benchmark show the benefits of our method, and the influence of specific parameter settings. our code, data and an interactive system demonstration are publicly available at https://github.com/ghoshs/coqex and https://nlcounqer.mpi-inf.mpg.de/.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0048

"assessment of the visual quality of colour images is usually a difficult process, validated through hard-to -carry-out psychophysical experiments, used to record observer quality scores. visual image quality metrics aim to maximise the agreement between computed indexes and observer scores, or opinions. therefore, in this area, it is of critical importance to have appropriate measures of this agreement (i.e. performance) between the computed image quality metric values and observer's quality scores, both for the development, as well as for the use of image quality metrics. among the measures of agreement, the most used one nowadays is the well-known pearson correlation coefficient, while spearman rank correlation coefficient is also commonly used. the aim of this paper is two-fold. first, to introduce the standardised residual sum of squares (stress) as an alternative metric for the agreement between computed image quality and observers quality scores and analyse its properties and advantages in front of pearson, spearman and kendall correlation coefficients; second, to introduce a new version of stress (called ust ress) that takes observers' scores variability into account. the results on synthetic and real datasets support that stress has a series of benefits in front of the classical approaches and that the inclusion of uncertainty in stress has an important effect on the results, quantified by statistical significance tests. a free to download matlab code version of ust ress is available at https://viplab.webs.upv.es/resources/",AB_0048
