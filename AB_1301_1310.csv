"backgroundboth acute normovolumic hemodilution (anh) and autologous platelet-rich plasma (aprp) have been demonstrated blood-protective effects in cardiac aortic surgery; however, the efficacies of the two methods have not been compared. this study aims to compare the effects of aprp and anh prior to aortic surgery on postoperative bleed and other outcomes.methods and analysisthis is a prospective, single-center, double-blind controlled clinical trial including 160 patients randomized 1:1 to receive aprp (test group) or autologous whole blood (anh, control group). the primary objective is to compare the drainage volumes in the two groups at 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively. secondary outcomes include input of allogeneic blood and blood products and durations of aortic block, extracorporeal circulation, deep hypothermic arrest of circulation, tracheal extubation, hospital stay, requirement for secondary surgical hemostasis, and application of intra-aortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the two groups. in addition, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, central venous pressure, and thromboelastography recorded before blood reservation (t1), after blood reservation (t2), before blood transfusion (t3), and after the blood is returned (t4) to the transfusion will be compared between the two groups of patients.discussionthis study will demonstrate if the use of aprp could reduce the risk of bleeding after aortic surgery compared with anh. the results are expected to have practical clinical applications in terms of more effective blood protection and shorter hospital stay.trial registrationthis study was registered with the chinese clinical trial registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn/) with the id chictr 1900023351.registered on may 23, 2019.trial statusrecruiting start date: july 1, 2019; expected recruiting end date: july 1, 2024version number and date: version 2 of 05-04-2019trial statusrecruiting start date: july 1, 2019; expected recruiting end date: july 1, 2024version number and date: version 2 of 05-04-2019",AB_0131
"as one of the most significant components of the ecosystem, waterbody needs to be highly monitored at different spatial and temporal scales. nevertheless, waterbody variations in shape, size, and reflectivity, complicated and varied types of land covers, and environmental scene diversity, present colossal challenges in achieving accurate waterbody detection (wd). in this paper, we propose a novel network coupled with the transformer and convolutional neural network (cnn), termed waterformer, to automatically, efficiently, and accurately delineate waterbodies from optical high-resolution remotely sensed (hr-rs) images. this network mainly includes a dualstream cnn, a cross-level vision transformer, a light-weight attention module, and a sub-pixel up-sampling module. first, the dual-stream network abstracts waterbody features at multi-views and different levels. then, to exploit the long-range dependencies between low-level spatial information and high-order semantic features, the cross-level vision transformer is embedded into the dual-stream, aiming at improving wd accuracy. afterwards, the light-weight attention module is adopted to provide semantically strong feature abstractions by enhancing discrimination neurons, and the sub-pixel up-sampling module is employed to further generate high-resolution and high-quality class-specific representations. quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrated that the waterformer provided a promising means for detecting waterbody areas in satellite images under complex scene conditions. moreover, comparative analyses with the state-of-the-art (sota) alternatives, e.g., msfenet, msafnet, and bisenet, also verified the generalization and superiority of the waterformer in wd tasks. the assessment results exhibited that the waterformer gained an average accuracy of 97.24%, average precision of 94.59%, average recall of 91.95%, average f1-score of 93.24%, and average kappa index of 0.9133, respectively. additionally, we presented an open-access hr satellite imagery waterbody dataset, a mesoscale dataset with high-quality and high-precision waterbody annotation to facilitate future research in this field. the dataset has been released at https://github.com/njdeuk/wd_dataset.",AB_0131
"tumor mutation burden (tmb) is a potential biomarker for evaluating the prognosis and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, but its costly and time-consuming method of measurement limits its widespread application. this study aimed to identify the tmb-related histopathologic features from hematoxylin and eosin slides and explore their prognostic value in gliomas. tmb-related features were detected using a graph convolutional neural network from whole-slide images of patients from the cancer genome atlas data set (619 patients), and the correlation between features and tmb was evaluated in an external validation set (237 patients). tmb-related features were used for predicting overall survival (os) of patients to investigate whether these features have potential for prognostic prediction. moreover, biological pathways underlying the prognostic value of the features were further explored. histopathologic features derived from whole-slide images were significantly associated with patient tmb (p = 0.007 in the external validation set). tmb-related features showed excellent per-formance for os prediction, and patients with lower-grade gliomas could be further stratified into different risk groups according to the features (p = 0.00013; hazard ratio, 4.004). pathways involved in the cell cycle and execution of immune response were enriched in patients with higher os risk. the tmb-related features could be used to estimate tmb and aid in prognostic risk stratification of patients with glioma with dysregulated biological pathways.

"a growing body of evidence suggests de novo lipogenesis as a key metabolic pathway adopted by cancers to fuel tumorigenic processes. while increased de novo lipogenesis has also been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), understanding on molecular mechanisms driving de novo lipogenesis remains limited. in the present study, the functional role of sortilin, a member of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein receptor family, in hcc was investigated. sortilin was overexpressed in hcc and was associated with poorer survival outcome. in functional studies, sortilin-overexpressing cells conferred tumorigenic phenotypes, namely, self-renewal and metastatic potential, of hcc cells via the cancer secretome. proteomic profiling highlighted fatty acid metabolism as a potential molecular pathway associated with sortilin-driven cancer secretome. this finding was validated by the increased lipid content and expression of fatty acid synthase (fasn) in hcc cells treated with conditioned medium collected from sortilin-overexpressing cells. the enhanced tumorigenic properties endowed by sortilin-driven cancer secretome were partly abrogated by co-administration of fasn inhibitor c75. further mechanistic dissection suggested protein stabilization by post-translational modification with o-glcnacylation as a major mechanism leading to augmented fasn expression. in conclusion, the present study uncovered the role of sortilin in hepatocarcinogenesis via modulation of the cancer secretome and deregulated lipid metabolism.

"quantifying the full-volatility organic emissions from cooking sources is important for understanding the causes of organic aerosol pollution. however, existing national cooking emission inventories in china fail to cover full-volatility organics and have large biases in estimating emissions and their spatial distribution. here, we develop the first emission inventory of full-volatility organics from cooking in china, which covers emissions from individual commercial restaurants as well as residential kitchens and canteens. in our emission estimates, we use cuisine-specific full-volatility emission factors and provincial policy-driven purification facility installation proportions, which allows us to consider the significant impact of diverse dietary preferences and policy changes on china's cooking emissions. the 2021 emissions of volatile organic compounds (vocs), intermediate-volatility organic compounds (ivocs), semi-volatile organic compounds (svocs), and organic compounds with even lower volatility (xlvocs) from cooking in china are 561 (317-891, 95 % confidence interval) kt yr(-1), 241 (135-374) kt yr(-1), 176 (95.8-290) kt yr(-1), and 13.1 (7.36-21.0) kt yr(-1), respectively. the ivoc and svoc emissions from cooking account for 9 %-21 % and 31 %-62 % of the total emissions from all sources in the five most densely populated cities in china. among all cooking types, commercial cooking dominates the emissions, contributing 54.5 %, 66.2 %, 68.5 %, and 46.7 % to the voc, ivoc, svoc, and xlvoc emissions, respectively. sichuan-hunan cuisine contributes the most to total cooking emissions among all commercial cuisines. residential cooking emissions are also important, accounting for 22.2 %-47.1 % of the cooking organic emissions across the four volatility ranges, whereas canteens make minor contributions to each volatility range (<10 %). in terms of spatial distribution, emission hotspots mainly occur in densely populated areas and regions with oily and spicy dietary preferences. from 2015 to 2021, national organic emissions from cooking increased by 25.2 % because of the rapid growth of the catering industry, despite being partly offset by the increased installation of purification facilities. future control measures need to further promote the purification facilities in commercial restaurants and improve their removal efficiency as well as reduce emissions from residential cooking. our dataset and generalizable methodology serve as valuable resources for evaluating the air quality, climate, and health impacts of cooking sources, and help to formulate effective emission control policies. our national, multi-year, high-spatial-resolution dataset can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23537673 (li et al., 2023).",AB_0131
"cameras and lidars are currently two types of sensors commonly used for 3d mapping. vision-based methods are susceptible to textureless regions and lighting, and lidar-based methods easily degenerate in scenes with insignificant structural features. most current fusion-based methods require strict synchronization between the camera and lidar and need auxiliary sensors, such as imu. all of these lead to an increase in device cost and complexity. to address that, in this paper, we propose a low-cost mapping pipeline called panovlm that only requires a panoramic camera and a lidar without strict synchronization. first, camera poses are estimated by a lidar-assisted global structure-from-motion, and lidar poses are derived with the initial camera-lidar relative pose. then, line-to-line and point-to-plane associations are established between lidar point clouds, which are used to further refine lidar poses and remove motion distortion. with the initial sensor poses, line-to-line correspondences are established between images and lidars to refine their poses jointly. the final step, joint panoramic multi-view stereo, estimates the depth map for each panoramic image and fuses them into a complete dense 3d map. experimental results show that panovlm can work on various scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art (sota) vision-based and lidar-based methods. compared with the current sota lidar-based techniques, namely loam, lego-loam, and f-loam, panovlm manifests a reduction in the absolute rotation error and absolute translation error by 20% and 35%, respectively. our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/panovlm.",AB_0131

"precision medicine based on personalized genomics provides promising strategies to enhance the efficacy of molecular-targeted therapies. however, the clinical effectiveness of drugs has been severely limited due to genetic variations that lead to drug resistance. predicting the impact of missense mutations on clinical drug response is an essential way to reduce the cost of clinical trials and understand genetic diseases. here, we present emden, a novel method integrating graph and transformer representations that predicts the effect of missense mutations on drug response through binary classification with interpretability. emden utilized protein sequences-based features and drug structures as inputs for rapid prediction, employing competitive representation learning and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and robustness. our study showed promising potential for clinical drug guidance and deep insight into computer-assisted precision medicine. emden is freely available as a web server at https://www.psymukb.net/emden.",AB_0131
"background: although reference ranges of t1 and t2 mapping are well established for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) at 1.5t, data for 3t are still lacking. the objective of this study is to establish reference ranges of myocardial t1 and t2 based on a large multicenter cohort of healthy chinese adults at 3t cmr.methods: a total of 1015 healthy chinese adults (515 men, age range: 19-87 years) from 11 medical centers who underwent cmr using 3t siemens scanners were prospectively enrolled. t1 mapping was performed with a motion-corrected modified look-locker inversion recovery sequence using a 5(3)3 scheme. t2 mapping images were acquired using t2-prepared fast low-angle shot sequence. t1 and t2 relaxation times were quantified for each slice and each myocardial segment. the t1 mapping and extracellular volume standardization (t1mes) phantom was used for quality assurance at each center prior to subject scanning.results: the phantom analysis showed strong consistency of spin echo, t1 mapping, and t2 mapping among centers. in the entire cohort, global t1 and t2 reference values were 1193 +/- 34 ms and 36 +/- 2.5 ms. global t1 and t2 values were higher in females than in males (t1: 1211 +/- 29 ms vs. 1176 +/- 30 ms, p < 0.001; t2: 37 +/- 2.3 ms vs. 35 +/- 2.5 ms, p < 0.001). there were statistical differences in global t2 across age groups (p < 0.001), but not in global t1. linear regression showed no correlation between age and global t1 or t2 values. in males, positive correlation was found between heart rate and global t1 (r = 0.479, p < 0.001).conclusions: using phantom-validated imaging sequences, we provide reference ranges for myocardial t1 and t2 values on 3t scanners in healthy chinese adults, which can be applied across participating sites. trial registration url: http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx . unique identifier: chictr1900025518. registration name: 3t magnetic resonance myocardial quantitative imaging standardization and reference value study: a multi-center clinical study.",AB_0131
"referring image segmentation (ris) aims to extract the object or stuff from an image according to the given natural language expression. as a representative multi-modal reasoning task, the main challenge of ris lies in accurately understanding and aligning two types of heterogeneous data (i.e. image and text). existing methods typically conduct this task via inexplicit cross-modal fusion toward the visual and linguistic features, which are separately extracted from different encoders and hard to capture accurate image-text alignment information due to their distinct latent representation structures. in this paper, we propose a dual-graph hierarchical interaction network (dghin) to facilitate the explicit and comprehensive alignment between the image and text data. firstly, two graphs are separately built for the initial visual and linguistic features extracted with different pre-trained encoders. by means of graph reasoning, we obtain a unified representation structure for different modalities to capture the intra-modal entities and their contexts, where each projected node incorporates the long-range dependencies into the latent representation. then, the hierarchical interaction module (him) is applied to the visual and linguistic graphs to extract comprehensive inter-modal correlations from the entity level and graph level, which not only capture the corresponding keywords and visual patches but also draws the whole sentence closer to the image region with the consistent context in the latent space. extensive experiments on refcoco, refcoco+, g-ref, and referit demonstrate that the proposed dghin outperforms many state-of-the-art methods. code is available at https://github.com/zhaofengshi/referring-dghin.",AB_0131
