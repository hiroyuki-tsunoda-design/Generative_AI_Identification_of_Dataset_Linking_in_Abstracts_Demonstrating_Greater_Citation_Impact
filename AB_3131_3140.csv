"although nascent rna profiling data are widely used in transcriptional regulation studies, the develop-ment and standardization of data processing pipeline lags far behind rna-seq. we are filling this gap by establishing the nasap web server (https://grobase.top/nasap/) to provide practical quality evaluation and comprehensive analysis of nascent rna datasets. in nasap, four customized analysis modules are provided, including i) quality assessment, which summarizes the sequencing statistics, mapping ratio, and evaluates rna integrity and mrna contamination; ii) quantification analysis for mrnas, lncrnas and ernas; iii) pausing analysis across the whole genome based on sequencing reads distribution; and iv) network analysis to better understand the gene regulatory mechanism by obtaining annotated enhancer-promoter interactomes. the nasap is user-friendly and outperforms the existing pipeline for quality control of nascent rna profiling data. we anticipate that nasap, which eases both basic and advanced analysis of nascent rna data, will be extremely useful in various fields.(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0314
"widespread fake news on social media threatens public security and the cyber environment, making fake news detection an essential area of study. the majority of existing fake news detection methods rely on news content (e.g., text and images) and/or social contexts (e.g., comment interactions between posts) to determine the veracity of news. however, existing methods still have the following drawbacks: (1) overreliance on sufficient reliable labeled data. (2) lack of robustness to noise and fraudster-designed harmful disguises. (3) inability to differentiate between the multiple intentions behind retweet and comment behaviors, resulting in generating entangled representations. to address the above aforementioned three issues, we introduce contrastive learning and disentangled representation learning for fake news detection. specifically, to mine supervised signals from unlabeled data and improve the model's robustness, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning framework that includes multiple data augmentation strategies and three contrastive learning tasks. in addition, to infer the latent intentions of retweets and comments between posts, we propose the disentangled graph encoder (disen-graphenc) and disentangled sequence encoder (disen-seqenc). extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over other state-of-the-art methods and is resistant to limited training data and noise attacks. our code is available on the github (https://github.com/senllh/dhcf).",AB_0314
"ligand binding sites provide essential information for uncovering protein functions and structure-based drug discovery. to facilitate cavity detection and property analysis process, we developed a comprehensive web server, cavityplus in 2018. cavityplus applies the cavity program to detect potential binding sites in a given protein structure. the cavpharmer, corrsite, and covcys tools can then be applied to generate receptor-based pharmacophore models, identify potential allosteric sites, or detect druggable cysteine residues for covalent drug design. while cavityplus has been widely used, the constantly evolving knowledge and methods make it necessary to improve and extend its functions. this study presents a new version of cavityplus, cavityplus 2022 through a series of upgrades. we upgraded the cavity tool to greatly speed up cavity detection calculation. we optimized the cavpharmer tool for fast speed and more accurate results. we integrated the newly developed corrsite2.0 into the cavityplus 2022 web server for its improved performance of allosteric site prediction. we also added a new cavitymatch module for drug repurposing and protein function studies by searching similar cavities to a given cavity from pre constructed cavity databases. the new version of cavityplus is freely available at http://pkumdl.cn: 8000/cavityplus/.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0314
"spatial proteomics aims for a global description of organelle-specific protein distribution and dynamics, which is essential for understanding the molecular functions and cellular processes in health and disease. however, the application of this technique is seriously restricted by the neglect of robustness among pro-teomic signatures identified using standard statistical frameworks. moreover, it is still a major bottleneck to automatically interpretate the identified proteomic signatures due to lack of integration of subcellular infor-mation. herein, an online-tool sispro was constructed to (a) identify proteomic signatures with good robustness and accuracy via collectively evaluating relative weighted consistency (cwrel) & area under the curve (auc) and (b) interpretate the identified signature based on comprehensive subcellular informa-tion from 9 organelles and 22 subcellular structures. all in all, sispro provides the endeavor to realize the simultaneous improvement of robustness and accuracy in signature identification and the unique capacity in biological annotation lies in its wide coverage of proteins and comprehensive spatial informa-tion. sispro is expected to be critical in spatial proteomic studies, which can be freely accessed without any login requirement at https://idrblab.org/sispro/ (c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0314
"protein structural domains have been less studied than full-length proteins in terms of ontology annotations. the dcgo database has filled this gap by providing mappings from protein domains to ontologies. the dcgo update in 2023 extends annotations for protein domains of multiple definitions (scop, pfam, and interpro) with commonly used ontologies that are categorised into functions, phenotypes, diseases, drugs, pathways, regulators, and hallmarks. this update adds new dimensions to the utility of both ontology and protein domain resources. a newly designed website at http://www.protdomainonto.pro/dcgo offers a more centralised and user-friendly way to access the dcgo database, with enhanced faceted search returning term-and domain-specific information pages. users can navigate both ontology terms and annotated domains through improved ontology hierarchy browsing. a newly added facility enables domain-based ontology enrichment analysis. & copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0314
"metal-binding proteins are essential for the vital activities and engage in their roles by acting in concert with metal cations. mbpa (the metal-binding protein atlas) is the most comprehensive resource up to now dedicated to curating metal-binding proteins. currently, it contains 106,373 entries and 440,187 sites related to 54 metals and 8169 species. users can view all metal-binding proteins and species-specific proteins in mbpa. there are also metal-proteomics data that quantitatively describes protein expression in different tissues and organs. by analyzing the data of the amino acid residues at the metal-binding site, it is found that about 80% of the metal ions tend to bind to cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and histidine. moreover, we use diversity measure to confirm that the diversity of metal-binding is specific in different area of periodic table, and further elucidate the binding modes of 19 transition metals on 20 amino acids. in addition, mbpa also embraces 6855 potential pathogenic mutations related to metalloprotein. the resource is freely available at http://bioinfor.imu.edu.cn/mbpa.

"current sequence-based predictors of protein-binding residues (pbrs) belong to two distinct categories: structure-trained vs. intrinsic disorder-trained. since disordered pbrs differ from structured pbrs in several ways, including ability to bind multiple partners by folding into different conformations and enrichment in different amino acids, the structure-trained and disorder-trained predictors were shown to provide inaccurate results for the other annotation type. a simple consensus-based solution that combines structure- and disorder-trained methods provides limited levels of predictive performance and generates relatively many cross-predictions, where residues that interact with other ligand types are predicted as pbrs. we address this unsolved problem by designing a novel and fast deep-learner, deepprobind, that relies on carefully designed modular convolutional architecture and uses innovative aggregate input features. comparative empirical tests on a low-similarity test dataset reveal that deepprobind generates accurate predictions of structured and disordered pbrs and low amounts of cross-predictions, outperforming a comprehensive collection of 12 predictors of pbrs. given the relatively low runtime of deepprobind (40 seconds per protein), we further validate its results based on an analysis of putative pbrs in the yeast proteome, confirming that interactions in disordered regions are enriched among hub proteins. we release deepprobind as a convenient web server at https://www.csuligroup.com/deepprobind/.

"due to the unique construction module and design of graph neural networks (gnns), neural archi-tecture search (nas) methods specifically for gnns have become a promising research hotspot in recent years. among the existing methods, one class of methods microscopically searches for the constituent components of network layers. however, most of them ignore the topology connections between network layers or the feature fusion strategies. another class of methods, called differentiable architecture search methods, has the advantage of searching topology connections and feature fusion strategies. however, constrained by the requirement of predefining all candidate operations, these methods can only sample a limited number of network layers. in this paper, we propose a surrogate evolutionary graph neural architecture search (gnas) algorithm whose search space contains not only the microscopic network layer components but also topology connections and feature fusion strategies (called ctfgnas). the gnn sampled in ctfgnas is represented by a simple one-dimensional vector and does not fix the network depth. to address the problem that traditional crossover and mutation operators applied to gnas may produce illegal solutions, we design a repair operation to guarantee the legitimacy of the solutions. the network depth is also increased with a large probability in the mutation operation to alleviate the oversmoothing problem. in addition, to cope with the challenge of computational resources due to the increased search space, we form a surrogate model with three classical regression models, where only a small number of solutions are truly evaluated for their fitness, and the remaining large number of solutions are predicted for their fitness by the surrogate model. finally, experiments are executed on six widely used real-world datasets. the experimental results illustrate that ctfgnas obtains more effective results than the state-of-the-art handcrafted gnns and gnas methods on all datasets. ctfgnas is now available on the following website: https://github.com/chnyliu/ctfgnas.& copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0314
"emerging evidence suggests that due to the misuse of antibiotics, bacteriophage (phage) therapy has been recognized as one of the most promising strategies for treating human diseases infected by antibioticresistant bacteria. identification of phage-host interactions (phis) can help to explore the mechanisms of bacterial response to phages and provide new insights into effective therapeutic approaches. compared to conventional wet-lab experiments, computational models for predicting phis can not only save time and cost, but also be more efficient and economical. in this study, we developed a deep learning predictive framework called gsphi to identify potential phage and target bacterium pairs through dna and protein sequence information. more specifically, gsphi first initialized the node representations of phages and target bacterial hosts via a natural language processing algorithm. then a graph embedding algorithm structural deep network embedding (sdne) was utilized to extract local and global information from the interaction network, and finally, a deep neural network (dnn) was applied to accurately detect the interactions between phages and their bacterial hosts. in the drug-resistant bacteria dataset eskape, gsphi achieved a prediction accuracy of 86.65 % and auc of 0.9208 under the 5-fold cross-validation technique, significantly better than other methods. in addition, case studies in gram-positive and negative bacterial species demonstrated that gsphi is competent in detecting potential phage-host interactions. taken together, these results indicate that gsphi can provide reasonable candidate sensitive bacteria to phages for biological experiments. the webserver of the gsphi predictor is freely available at http://120.77.11.78/ gsphi/.& copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0314
"face forgery detection aims to distinguish between real and fake facial images or videos by identifying manipulated or forged visual media. the main challenge in face forgery detection is achieving high model generalization ability, i.e., satisfactory performance under cross-database scenarios where the training and testing datasets are from different forgery methods. to achieve this goal, this paper presents an attention-erasing stripe pyramid network (aspnet) to utilize high-frequency noises and exploit both the rgb and fine-grained frequency clues. first, since separately extracting features from different scales and granularities will ignore their complementarity, we employ a stripe pyramid block (spb) to learn multi-scale and multi granularity features simultaneously. second, to make the model focus on useful information and suppress noise, a two-stage attention block (tsab) is introduced by combining spatial attention and channel attention to filter out the pixel-wise and channel-wise noise in the learned feature maps. finally, to dynamically guide the model to pay attention to different areas of the human face, an attention erasing (ae) scheme is adopted by randomly erasing units in attention maps. sufficient experiments demonstrate that aspnet has superior performance than f-3-net on the faceforensics++ dataset. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) and the accuracy (acc) of our model reach 77.4% and 70.85%, respectively, which are improved by 0.83% and 1.28% compared with f-3-net. our code is available at: https://github.com/nwpu-zwu.",AB_0314
