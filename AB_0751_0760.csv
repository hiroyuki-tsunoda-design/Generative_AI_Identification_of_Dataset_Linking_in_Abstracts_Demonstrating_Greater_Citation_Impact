"backgroundperinatal women are highly vulnerable to developing mental health issues and particularly susceptible to a recurrence of psychiatric illness. poor mental health during the perinatal period can have long-term impacts on the physical and psychiatric health of both mother and child. a potentially useful strategy to improve women's mental health is through a mobile application teaching mindfulness, an evidence-based technique helping individuals focus on the present moment.methodsa mixed method, prospective randomised controlled trial. the study group comprise women aged 18 years and over, who are attending the public and private maternity clinics at mater mothers' hospital. a sample of 360 prenatal women will be randomised into the intervention group (with the use of the mindfulness app) or usual care. participants will remain in the study for 11 months and will be assessed at four timepoints for changes in postnatal depression, mother-infant bonding, and quality of life. a cost-effectiveness evaluation will also be conducted using quality-adjusted life year (qaly) calculations. a random selection of intervention participants will be invited to attend focus groups to give feedback on the mindfulness app.discussionprevious studies have found mindfulness interventions can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances in a prenatal population. the risks of the intervention are low, but could be of significant benefit for women who are unable to attend face-to-face appointments due to geographical, financial, or time barriers; during endemic or pandemic scenarios; or due to health or mobility issues.trial registrationthis study was approved by the mater misericordiae human research ethics committee (83,589). australian new zealand clinical trials registry (anzctr) actrn12622001581752 (https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=385107&isreview=true). registered on 22 dec. 2022.",AB_0076
"motivation whole genome alignment of eukaryote species remains an important method for the determination of sequence and structural variations and can also be used to ascertain the representative non-redundant core-genome sequence of a population. many whole genome alignment tools were first developed for the more mature analysis of prokaryote species with few current tools containing the functionality to process larger genomes of eukaryotes as well as genomes of more divergent species. in addition, the functionality of these tools becomes computationally prohibitive due to the significant compute resources needed to handle larger genomes.results in this research, we present coredetector, an easy-to-use general-purpose program that can align the core-genome sequences for a range of genome sizes and divergence levels. to illustrate the flexibility of coredetector, we conducted alignments of a large set of closely related fungal pathogen and hexaploid wheat cultivar genomes as well as more divergent fly and rodent species genomes. in all cases, compared to existing multiple genome alignment tools, coredetector exhibited improved flexibility, efficiency, and competitive accuracy in tested cases.availability and implementation coredetector was developed in the cross platform, and easily deployable, java language. a packaged pipeline is readily executable in a bash terminal without any external need for perl or python environments. installation, example data, and usage instructions for coredetector are freely available from https://github.com/mfruzan/coredetector.",AB_0076
"background:the optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy for isolated distal deep vein thrombosis in patients with cancer is clinically relevant, but the evidence is lacking. the prolonged anticoagulation therapy could have a potential benefit for prevention of thrombotic events; however, it could also increase the risk of bleeding.methods:in a multicenter, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, randomized clinical trial at 60 institutions in japan, we randomly assigned patients with cancer with isolated distal deep vein thrombosis, in a 1-to-1 ratio, to receive either a 12-month or 3-month edoxaban treatment. the primary end point was a composite of a symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism (vte) or vte-related death at 12 months. the major secondary end point was major bleeding at 12 months, according to the criteria of the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis. the primary hypothesis was that a 12-month edoxaban treatment was superior to a 3-month edoxaban treatment with respect to the primary end point.results:from april 2019 through june 2022, 604 patients were randomized, and after excluding 3 patients who withdrew consent, 601 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population: 296 patients in the 12-month edoxaban group and 305 patients in the 3-month edoxaban group. the mean age was 70.8 years, 28% of the patients were men, and 20% of the patients had symptoms of deep vein thrombosis at baseline. the primary end point of a symptomatic recurrent vte event or vte-related death occurred in 3 of the 296 patients (1.0%) in the 12-month edoxaban group and in 22 of the 305 patients (7.2%) in the 3-month edoxaban group (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% ci, 0.03-0.44). the major secondary end point of major bleeding occurred in 28 of the 296 patients (9.5%) in the 12-month edoxaban group and in 22 of the 305 patients (7.2%) in the 3-month edoxaban group (odds ratio, 1.34; 95% ci, 0.75-2.41). the prespecified subgroups did not affect the estimates on the primary end point.conclusions:in patients with cancer with isolated distal deep vein thrombosis, 12 months was superior to 3 months for an edoxaban treatment with respect to the composite outcome of a symptomatic recurrent vte or vte-related death.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03895502.",AB_0076
"motivation cell function is regulated by gene regulatory networks (grns) defined by protein-mediated interaction between constituent genes. despite advances in experimental techniques, we can still measure only a fraction of the processes that govern grn dynamics. to infer the properties of grns using partial observation, unobserved sequential processes can be replaced with distributed time delays, yielding non-markovian models. inference methods based on the resulting model suffer from the curse of dimensionality.results we develop a simulation-based bayesian mcmc method employing an approximate likelihood for the efficient and accurate inference of grn parameters when only some of their products are observed. we illustrate our approach using a two-step activation model: an activation signal leads to the accumulation of an unobserved regulatory protein, which triggers the expression of observed fluorescent proteins. with prior information about observed fluorescent protein synthesis, our method successfully infers the dynamics of the unobserved regulatory protein. we can estimate the delay and kinetic parameters characterizing target regulation including transcription, translation, and target searching of an unobserved protein from experimental measurements of the products of its target gene. our method is scalable and can be used to analyze non-markovian models with hidden components.availability and implementation our code is implemented in r and is freely available with a simple example data at https://github.com/mathbiomed/simmcmc.",AB_0076
"here we present the high-resolution continuous flow analysis (cfa) data from the top 479 m of the east greenland ice coring project (egrip) ice core covering the past 3.8 kyr. the data consist of 1 mm depth-resolution profiles of calcium, sodium, ammonium, nitrate, and electrolytic conductivity as well as decadal averages of these profiles. the nominally 1 mm data represent an oversampling of the record as the true resolution is limited by the analytical setup to approximately 1 cm. alongside the data we provide a description of the measurement setup, procedures, the relevant references for the specific methods as well as an assessment of the precision of the measurements, the sample-to-depth assignment, and the depth and temporal resolution of the data set. the error in absolute depth assignment of the data may be on the order of 2 cm; however, relative depth offsets between the records of the individual species are only on the order of 1 mm. the presented data have sub-annual resolution over the entire depth range and have already formed part of the data for an annually layer-counted timescale for the egrip ice core used to improve and revise the multi-core greenland ice-core chronology (gicc05) to a new version, gicc21 (sinnl et al., 2022). the data are available in full 1 mm resolution and decadal averages on pangaea (https://doi.org/10.1594/pangaea.945293, erhardt et al., 2022b).",AB_0076
"background: nurses caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) experience higher psychosocial distress than other healthcare workers, and this can adversely affect the quality of patient care. there is evidence that inhalation of essential oil from marjoram (origanum majorana l.) has calming effects, suggesting this intervention may help to reduce the stress and anxiety of nurses working in a covid-19 intensive care unit (icu). this study aimed to investigate the effect of inhalation of marjoram essential oil at work on the stress and anxiety levels of nurses in a covid-19 icu.methods: nurses (n = 57) working in a single covid-19 icu were randomly assigned to inhale 3% marjoram essential oil (marjoram group, n = 29) or almond oil (control group, n = 28) for 2 h while at work. mean arterial pressure (map), heart rate, state anxiety score, and score on a visual analog scale for anxiety (vas-anxiety) and stress (vas-stress) were measured before and after the intervention.results: the two groups had similar baseline variables. map did not have within-group or between-group differences. heart rate increased significantly in the marjoram group after the intervention (p = 0.031), but it remained within the normal range and the increase was not clinically meaningful. there was no significant between-group difference in the state-anxiety or vas-anxiety score after the intervention, but the marjoram group had a significantly lower state-anxiety (p = 0.001) and vas-anxiety (p = 0.037) score at posttest vs. pretest. the vas-stress score was significantly lower in the marjoram group at the posttest vs. the pretest (p = 0.026).conclusion: nurses caring for patients in a covid-19 icu experience significant stress, and strategies are needed to address this important issue. inhalation of 3% marjoram essential oil while caring for patients in a covid-19 icu may be a simple and effective intervention that reduces perceived stress and anxiety in nurses. clinical trial registration: https://cris.nih.go.kr/, kct0007543.",AB_0076
"dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (dusp6) is a specific phosphatase for mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk). this study used a high-fat diet (hfd)-induced murine nonalcoholic fatty liver disease model to investigate the role of dusp6 in this disease. wild-type (wt) and dusp6-haploinsufficiency mice developed severe obesity and liver pathology consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease when exposed to hfd. in contrast, dusp6-knockout (ko) mice completely eliminated these phenotypes. furthermore, primary hepatocytes isolated from wt mice exposed to palmitic and oleic acids exhibited abundant intracellular lipid accumulation, whereas hepatocytes from dusp6-ko mice showed minimal lipid accumulation. transcriptome analysis revealed significant down-regulation of genes encoding cytochrome p450 4a (cyp4a), known to promote u-hydroxylation of fatty acids and hepatic steatosis, in dusp6-ko hepatocytes compared with that in wt hepatocytes. diminished cyp4a expression was observed in the liver of dusp6-ko mice compared with wt and dusp6-haploinsufficiency mice. knockdown of dusp6 in hepg2, a human liver-lineage cell line, also promoted a reduction of lipid accumulation, down-regulation of cyp4a, and up-regulation of phosphorylated/activated mapk. furthermore, inhibition of mapk activity promoted lipid accumulation in dusp6-knockdown hepg2 cells without affecting cyp4a expression, indicating that cyp4a expression is independent of mapk activation. these findings highlight the significant role of dusp6 in hfd-induced steatohepatitis through two distinct pathways involving cyp4a and mapk.

"as a key biogeochemical pathway in the marine nitrogen cycle, nitrification (ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation) converts the most reduced form of nitrogen - ammonium-ammonia (nh-nh3) - into the oxidized species nitrite (no) and nitrate (no). in the ocean, these processes are mainly performed by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (aoa) and bacteria (aob) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (nob). by transforming nitrogen speciation and providing substrates for nitrogen removal, nitrification affects microbial community structure; marine productivity (including chemoautotrophic carbon fixation); and the production of a powerful greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (n2o). nitrification is hypothesized to be regulated by temperature, oxygen, light, substrate concentration, substrate flux, ph and other environmental factors. although the number of field observations from various oceanic regions has increased considerably over the last few decades, a global synthesis is lacking, and understanding how environmental factors control nitrification remains elusive. therefore, we have compiled a database of nitrification rates and nitrifier abundance in the global ocean from published literature and unpublished datasets. this database includes 2393 and 1006 measurements of ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation rates and 2242 and 631 quantifications of ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers, respectively. this community effort confirms and enhances our understanding of the spatial distribution of nitrification and nitrifiers and their corresponding drivers such as the important role of substrate concentration in controlling nitrification rates and nitrifier abundance. some conundrums are also revealed, including the inconsistent observations of light limitation and high rates of nitrite oxidation reported from anoxic waters. this database can be used to constrain the distribution of marine nitrification, to evaluate and improve biogeochemical models of nitrification, and to quantify the impact of nitrification on ecosystem functions like marine productivity and n2o production. this database additionally sets a baseline for comparison with future observations and guides future exploration (e.g., measurements in the poorly sampled regions such as the indian ocean and method comparison and/or standardization). the database is publicly available at the zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8355912 (tang et al., 2023).",AB_0076
"the precise estimation of the number of trees, their individual tree locations, along with species information, is crucial for enhancing ecosystem services in urban areas. previous studies largely used satellite or airborne images for mapping trees, but they were insufficient to generate a large number of species distributions. ground-level data also led to inaccurate positional information of individual trees, although they provided reliable species detection results. in this study, we propose a novel framework that fully explores the complementary strengths of air- and ground-level sensing platforms by leveraging various deep neural networks to generate a detailed tree maps at a city-wide scale. our strategy includes individual tree mapping and tree species detection using threecolor channel images acquired from multiple sensing platforms. through publicly available airborne imagery, we estimate the presence of over 1.2 million trees in suwon city of south korea spanning 121.04 km2 (r2 of 0.95 and relative bias of -1.9 %), achieving more accurate individual tree positions (positional uncertainty around 2.0 m) than conventional methods. our comprehensive experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing tree bark photos and street-level imagery taken by citizens and vehicles to identify urban tree species, with accuracy rates of over 80 % for citizen-sensed tree species maps and 66 % for vehicle-sensed tree species map. along with the proliferation of web-based airborne images, the widespread use of smartphones, and the advancements in vehicle-mounted sensors, this study can facilitate efficient and accurate management of urban trees across scales. for reproducibility of the study, we share the source code and datasets at https://github.com/landkwon94/ ryoungseob-master.",AB_0076
