"in the presence of structural data, one sometimes need to compare 3d ligands. we design an overlay-free method to rank order 3d molecules in the pharmacophore feature space. the proposed encoding includes only two fittable parameters, is sparse, and is not too high dimensional. at the cost of an additional parameter, to delineate the binding site from a protein-ligand complex, the method can compare binding sites. the method was benchmarked on the lit-pcba data set for ligand-based virtual screening experiments and the sc-pdb and a vertex data set when comparing binding sites. in similarity searches, the proposed method outperforms an open-source software doing optimal superposition of ligand-based pharmacophores and rdkit's 3d pharmacophore fingerprints. when comparing binding sites, the method is competitive with state of the art approaches. on a single cpu core, up to 374,000 ligand/s or 132,000 binding site/s can be rank ordered. the autocorrelation of pharmacophore features open-source software is released at https:// github.com/tsudalab/acp4.",AB_0108
"t-cells recognize antigenic epitopes present on major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules, triggering an adaptive immune response in the host. t-cell epitope (tce) identification is challenging because of the extensive number of undetermined proteins found in eukaryotic pathogens, as well as mhc polymorphisms. in addition, conventional experimental approaches for tce identification are time-consuming and expensive. thus, computational approaches that can accurately and rapidly identify cd8+ t-cell epitopes (tces) of eukaryotic pathogens based solely on sequence information may facilitate the discovery of novel cd8+ tces in a cost-effective manner. here, pretoria (predictor of cd8+ tces of eukaryotic pathogens) is proposed as the first stack-based approach for accurate and large-scale identification of cd8+ tces of eukaryotic pathogens. in particular, pretoria enabled the extraction and exploration of crucial information embedded in cd8+ tces by employing a comprehensive set of 12 well-known feature descriptors extracted from multiple groups, including physicochemical properties, composition-transition-distribution, pseudo-amino acid composition, and amino acid composition. these feature descriptors were then utilized to construct a pool of 144 different machine learning (ml)-based classifiers based on 12 popular ml algorithms. finally, the feature selection method was used to effectively determine the important ml classifiers for the construction of our stacked model. the experimental results indicated that pretoria is an accurate and effective computational approach for cd8+ tce prediction; it was superior to several conventional ml classifiers and the existing method in terms of the inde-pendent test, with an accuracy of 0.866, mcc of 0.732, and auc of 0.921. additionally, to maximize user convenience for high-throughput identification of cd8+ tces of eukaryotic pathogens, a user-friendly web server of pretoria (http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/pretoria) was developed and made freely available.",AB_0108
"motivation: viruses have coevolved with their hosts for over millions of years and learned to escape the host's immune system. although not all genetic changes in viruses are deleterious, some significant mutations lead to the escape of neutralizing antibodies and weaken the immune system, which increases infectivity and transmissibility, thereby impeding the development of antiviral drugs or vaccines. accurate and reliable identification of viral escape mutational sequences could be a good indicator for therapeutic design. we developed a computational model that recognizes significant mutational sequences based on escape feature identification using natural language processing along with prior knowledge of experimentally validated escape mutants. results: our machine learning based computational approach can recognize the significant spike protein sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using sequence data alone. this modelling approach can be applied to other viruses, such as influenza, monkeypox and hiv using knowledge of escape mutants and relevant protein sequence datasets. availability: complete source code and pre -trained models for escape prediction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protein sequences are available on github at https://github.com/ premsinghbist/sars-cov-2-escape-model.git. the dataset is deposited to zenodo at: doi:10.5281/zenodo.7142638. the python scripts are easy to run and customize as needed. contact: premsing212@jbnu.acir",AB_0108
"recently, transformers have achieved great success in a number of computer vision tasks due to their excellent ability to capture long-range feature dependencies. in contrast, convolutional neural networks (cnns) are good at extracting local features. given that the capture of short-and long-range band dependencies are both important for hyperspectral data classification, we propose mce-st, a convolution-transformer (conformer) based framework capable of exploiting the complementary strengths of transformers and cnns. in contrast to the conventional transformer, which uses a linear projection for tokenization, the proposed mce-st uses a convolution-based tokenization method to extract local dependency between spectral bands. moreover, since different hyperspectral samples may have different spans of local relationships, a multiscale conformer encoder (mce) comprising two separate branches of depth-wise dilated convolution with different kernel sizes is used to extract the different spans of the local interactions between tokens. we conducted experiments on four salt stress datasets and one cassava disease dataset. the results show that the proposed mce-st outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for crop stress classification using hyperspectral data. the code for mce-st is publicly available at https://github.com/weejaa04/mce-st-github.",AB_0108
"despite various intraoperative thermal strategies, core heat loss is considerable during liver transplantation and hypothermia is common. we tested whether forced-air prewarming prevents hypothermia during liver transplantation. adult patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation were randomly assigned to non-prewarming group (n=20) or prewarming group (n=20). patients in prewarming group underwent 30-min forced-air warming before anesthetic induction. during surgery, core temperature was measured in the pulmonary artery. the primary outcome was intraoperative hypothermia (<36.0 degrees c). the secondary outcomes included plasma lactate concentration. intraoperative hypothermia risk was significantly lower in prewarming group than in non-prewarming group (60.0% vs. 95.0%, p=0.020). the difference in hypothermia incidence between groups was greater in the post-induction phase (20.0% vs. 85.0%, p<0.001) than in the anhepatic or post-reperfusion phase, suggesting that prewarming mainly acts on preventing post-induction core-to-peripheral heat redistribution. hypothermia duration was significantly shorter in prewarming group (60 [0-221] min vs. 383 [108-426] min, p=0.001). lactate concentration decreased during 3 h after graft reperfusion in prewarming group, whereas it continuously increased in non-prewarming group (- 0.19 [- 0.48 to 0.13] mmol/l vs. 1.17 [3.31-0.77] mmol/l, p=0.034). in conclusion, forced-air prewarming decreases the incidence and duration of intraoperative hypothermia with potential clinical benefit while mainly acting by preventing the core-to-peripheral heat redistribution.clinical trial registration: registered at the clinical research information service (https://cris.nih.go.kr, [kct0003230]) on 01/10/2018.",AB_0108
"a diverse and well-preserved radiolarian assemblage from the malongulli formation, new south wales, australia, contains 13 species representing 10 genera and six families. one new genus, wiradjuri, is introduced to accommodate pre-devonian single-shelled entactiniid taxa, and one new species, secuicollacta malongulliensis, is recorded together with some previously described forms. the microstructures of the rotasphaerid structure/primary unit and the ectopic spicule are investigated to validate their roles as fundamental units in the secuicollactidae, together with comprehensive documentation of the previously enigmatic pseudorotasphaera internal skeleton.the results of this investigation suggest that, among all radiolarian genera that survived the late ordovician mass extinction event (lome) and transitioned into the silurian, secuicollacta, haplotaeniatum, and palaeoephippium maintained stable body plans during the transition and were more successfully established. the selective advantages these lineages had during the lome were most likely spontaneous outcomes of the mode of structural development involving sequential skeletogenesis and a tendency to evolve toward simpler body plans.uuid: http://zoobank.org/264c026f-35af-4025-a4f7-de8f9a91f8b9",AB_0108
"taste peptides, as an important component of protein-rich foodstuffs, potentiate the nutrition and taste of food. thereinto, umami-and bitter-taste peptides have been ex tensively reported, while their taste mechanisms remain unclear. meanwhile, the identification of taste peptides is still a time-consuming and costly task. in this study, 489 peptides with umami/ bitter taste from tpdb (http://tastepeptides-meta.com/) were collected and used to train the classification models based on docking analysis, molecular descriptors (mds), and molecular fingerprints (fps). a consensus model, taste peptide docking machine (tpdm), was generated based on five learning algorithms (linear regression, random forest, gaussian naive bayes, gradient boosting tree, and stochastic gradient descent) and four molecular representation schemes. model interpretive analysis showed that mds (vsa_estate, minestateindex, mollogp) and fps (598, 322, 952) had the greatest impact on the umami/bitter prediction of peptides. based on the consensus docking results, we obtained the key recognition modes of umami/bitter receptors (t1rs/t2rs): (1) residues 107s-109s, 148s-154t, 247f-249a mainly form hydrogen bonding contacts and (2) residues 153a-158l, 163l, 181q, 218d, 247f-249a in t1r1 and 56d, 106p, 107v, 152v-156f, 173k-180f in t2r14 constituted their hydrogen bond pockets. the model is available at http://www.tastepeptides-meta.com/yyds.",AB_0108
"the early pennsylvanian nagaiwa formation contains fossils such as corals, fusulinids, and ostracodes, and its age and depositional environments have been determined by fusulinids and sedimentology. in this study, i describe the ostracode assemblages from the nagaiwa formation. moreover, i provide a reconstruction of the paleogeography of northeastern japan during the early pennsylvanian by comparing this ostracode assemblage with assemblages from other regions during the same period. thirty ostracode species, including 12 genera, have been identified, most of which are endemic species and 10 of which are new: jordanites michinokuensis n. sp., thuringobolbina ikeyai n. sp., aechmina iwatensis n. sp., pseudobythocypris asiatica n. sp., p. zipangu n. sp., p. siveteri n. sp., platyrhomboides tohokuensis n. sp., p. japonica n. sp., healdia ofunatensis n. sp., and h. rikutyuensis n. sp. two of these species are also found in central japan. the ostracodes from the nagaiwa formation are unique when compared with any other similarly aged assemblages.uuid: http://zoobank.org/c43f0787-4bb6-45d1-9c12-54a747c0b040",AB_0108
"we consider how to effectively use prior knowledge when learning a bayesian model from streaming environments where the data come endlessly and sequentially. this problem is highly important in the era of data explosion and rich sources of valuable external knowledge such as pre-trained models, ontologies, wikipedia, etc. we show that some existing approaches can forget any knowledge very fast. we then propose a novel framework that enables to incorporate the prior knowledge of different forms into a base bayesian model for data streams. our framework subsumes some existing popular models for time-series/dynamic data. extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing methods with a large margin. in particular, our framework can help bayesian models generalize well on extremely short text while other methods overfit. an implementation of our framework is available at http://github.com/bachtranxuan/tps.",AB_0108
"graph neural networks (gnns) have yielded fruitful results in learning multi-view graph data. however, it is challenging for existing gnns to capture the potential correlation information (pci) among the graph structure features of multiple views. it is also challenging to adaptively identify valuable neighbors for node feature fusion in different views. to this end, we propose a novel reinforced tensor graph neural network (rtgnn) framework to more effectively perform multi-view graph representation learning through reinforcing inter- and intra-graph aggregation. specifically, rtgnn first uses tensor decomposition to extract the graph structure features (gsfs) of each view in the common feature space. these gsfs contain the pci of multiple views and alleviate fusion conflicts that may be caused by differences between view feature spaces in cross-view feature fusion. since fusing the features of all neighbor nodes may harm the features of the center node, we filter the irrelevant neighbors to improve the performance of intra-graph aggregation in each view. concretely, a reinforcement learning (rl)-guided scheme is developed to automatically calculate the optimal filtering threshold for each view, avoiding tedious manual updates and infeasible back propagation updates. experimental results and analysis on five datasets show that rtgnn surpasses the best multi-view graph representation baselines and achieves the maximum 14.26% performance improvement in terms of f1. the code link is https://github.com/ringbdstack/rtgnn.",AB_0108
