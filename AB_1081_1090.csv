"and robot-world calibration is a problem in which the unknown homogeneous transformations x and y must be estimated for a loop closure equation ax = y b for a set of transformation measurement pairs {(a(i), b-i)}. previous studies on ax = y b have mainly relied on linear least-squares minimization followed by nonlinear iterative optimization for solution refinement to minimize the distances between a(i)x and y b-i. however, these methods have not been fully clarified, particularly in terms of calibration dependence on the coordination of a, b, x, and y along the system loop, as well as the underlying noise distributions of a(i) and b-i. they also lack flexibility in the noise properties of individual measurements; thus, they cannot incorporate the relative reliability between measurements. to address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic framework for hand-eye and robot-world calibration. the proposed framework clarifies the unclear aspects of existing methods by revealing their underlying assumptions regarding system noise. consequently, it identifies the applicability of distance minimization to a given calibration problem and provides the optimal coordination of transformations for distance minimization. for cases in which distance minimization is inapplicable, an iterative algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation is proposed, whereby the different noise properties of individual measurements can be accounted for. an estimation uncertainty analysis is presented for the proposed iterative algorithm to quantify the expected estimation accuracy. the presented theories and the proposed algorithm are validated using a set of numerical and hardware experiments. the code for the iterative algorithm and the estimation uncertainty is available at https://github.com/hjhdog1/probabilisticaxyb.",AB_0109
"background: previous epidemiological studies have suggested that phthalate exposure may contribute to neurocognitive and neurobehavioral disor-ders and decreased muscle strength and bone mass, all of which may be associated with reduced physical performance. walking speed is a reliable assessment tool for measuring physical performance in adults age 60 y and older. objective: we investigated associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and slowness of walking speed in community-dwelling adults ages 60-98 y.methods: we analyzed 1,190 older adults [range, 60-98 y of age; mean +/- standard deviation osd thorn , 74.81 +/- 5.99] from the korean elderly environmental panel ii study and measured repeatedly up to three times between 2012 and 2014. phthalate exposure was estimated using the follow-ing phthalate metabolites in urine samples: mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mehhp), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (meohp), mono -n-butyl phthalate (mnbp), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mecpp), and mono-benzyl phthalate (mbzp). slowness was defined as a walking speed of <1.0 meter/second. we used logistic and linear regression models to evaluate the association between each urinary phthalate metabolite and slowness or walking-speed change. we also used bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr) to examine overall mixture effects on walking speed.results: at enrollment, mbzp levels were associated with an increased odds of slowness [odds ratio (or) per doubling increase: 1.15, 95% confi-dence interval (ci): 1.02, 1.30; or for the highest vs. lowest quartile: 2.20 (95% ci: 1.12, 4.35) with p-trend across quartiles = 0.031]. in longitudinal analyses, mehhp levels showed an increased risk of slowness [or per doubling increase: 1.15 (95% ci: 1.02, 1.29), or for the highest vs. lowest quartile: 1.47 (95% ci: 1.04, 2.06), p-trend = 0.035]; whereas those with higher mnbp showed a reduced risk of slowness [or per doubling increase: 0.84 (95% ci: 0.74, 0.96), or in the highest (vs. lowest) quartile: 0.64 (95% ci: 0.47, 0.87), p-trend = 0.006]. for linear regression models, mbzp quartiles were associated with slower walking speed (p-trend = 0.048) at enrollment, whereas mehhp quartiles were associated with slower walking speed, and mnbp quartiles were associated with faster walking speed in longitudinal analysis (p-trend = 0.026 and <0.001, respectively). further, the bkmr analysis revealed negative overall trends between the phthalate metabolite mixtures and walking speed and dehp group (mehhp, meohp, and mecpp) had the main effect of the overall mixture.discussion: urinary concentrations of prevalent phthalates exhibited significant associations with slow walking speed in adults ages 60-98 y. https:// doi.org/10.1289/ehp10549",AB_0109
"currently, a high demand for on-device deep neural network (dnn) model deployment is limited by the large model size, computing-intensive floating-point operations (flops), and intellectual property (ip) infringements (i.e., easy access to model duplication for the avoidance of license payments). one appealing solution to addressing the first two concerns is model quantization, which reduces the model size and uses integer operations commonly supported by microcontrollers (mcus usually do not support flops). to this end, a 1-bit quantized dnn model or deep binary neural network (bnn) significantly improves the memory efficiency, where each parameter in a bnn model has only 1 bit. however, bnn cannot directly provide ip protection (in particular, the functionality of the model is locked unless there is a license payment). in this article, we propose a reconfigurable bnn (rbnn) to further amplify the memory efficiency for resource-constrained internet of things (iot) devices while naturally protecting the model ip. generally, rbnn can be reconfigured on demand to achieve any one of m (m > 1) distinct tasks with the same parameter set, thus only a single task determines the memory requirements. in other words, the memory utilization is improved by a factor of m. our extensive experiments corroborate that up to seven commonly used tasks (m = 7, six of these tasks are image related and the last one is audio) can co-exist (the value of m can be larger). these tasks with a varying number of classes have no or negligible accuracy drop-off (i.e., within 1%) on three binarized popular dnn architectures, including vgg, resnet, and reactnet. the tasks span across different domains, e.g., computer vision and audio domains validated herein, with the prerequisite that the model architecture can serve those crossdomain tasks. to fulfill the ip protection of an rbnn model, the reconfiguration can be controlled by both a user key and a deviceunique root key generated by the intrinsic hardware fingerprint (e.g., sram memory power-up pattern). by doing so, an rbnn model can only be used per paid user per authorized device, thus benefiting both the user and the model provider. the source code is released at https://github.com/learningmaker/rbnn.",AB_0109
"despite significant advances in graph representation learning, little attention has been paid to the more practical continual learning scenario in which new categories of nodes (e.g., new research areas in citation networks, or new types of products in co-purchasing networks) and their associated edges are continuously emerging, causing catastrophic forgetting on previous categories. existing methods either ignore the rich topological information or sacrifice plasticity for stability. to this end, we present hierarchical prototype networks (hpns) which extract different levels of abstract knowledge in the form of prototypes to represent the continuously expanded graphs. specifically, we first leverage a set of atomic feature extractors (afes) to encode both the elemental attribute information and the topological structure of the target node. next, we develop hpns to adaptively select relevant afes and represent each node with three levels of prototypes. in this way, whenever a new category of nodes is given, only the relevant afes and prototypes at each level will be activated and refined, while others remain uninterrupted to maintain the performance over existing nodes. theoretically, we first demonstrate that the memory consumption of hpns is bounded regardless of how many tasks are encountered. then, we prove that under mild constraints, learning new tasks will not alter the prototypes matched to previous data, thereby eliminating the forgetting problem. the theoretical results are supported by experiments on five datasets, showing that hpns not only outperform state-of-the-art baseline techniques but also consume relatively less memory. code and datasets are available at https://github.com/queuq/hpns.",AB_0109
"wikipedia combines the power of ai solutions and human reviewers to safeguard article quality. quality control objectives include detecting malicious edits, fixing typos, and spotting inconsistent formatting. however, no automated quality control mechanisms currently exist for mathematical formulae. spell checkers are widely used to highlight textual errors, yet no equivalent tool exists to detect algebraically incorrect formulae. our paper addresses this shortcoming by making mathematical formulae computable. we present a method that (1) gathers the semantic information surrounding the context of each mathematical formulae, (2) provides access to the information in a graph-structured dependency hierarchy, and (3) performs automatic plausibility checks on equations. we evaluate the performance of our approach on 6,337 mathematical expressions contained in 104 wikipedia articles on the topic of orthogonal polynomials and special functions. our system, lacast, verified 358 out of 1,516 equations as error-free. lacast successfully translated 27% of the mathematical expressions and outperformed existing translation approaches by 16%. additionally, lacast achieved an f1 score of .495 for annotating mathematical expressions with relevant textual descriptions, which isa significant step towards advancing searchability, readability, and accessibility of mathematical formulae in wikipedia. a prototype of lacast and the semantically enhanced wikipedia articles are available at: https://tpami.wmflabs.org.",AB_0109

"dynamic networks have shown their promising capability in reducing theoretical computation complexity by adapting their architectures to the input during inference. however, their practical runtime usually lags behind the theoretical acceleration due to inefficient sparsity. in this paper, we explore a hardware-efficient dynamic inference regime, named dynamic weight slicing, that can generalized well on multiple dimensions in both cnns and transformers (e.g. kernel size, embedding dimension, number of heads, etc.). instead of adaptively selecting important weight elements in a sparse way, we pre-define dense weight slices with different importance level by nested residual learning. during inference, weights are progressively sliced beginning with the most important elements to less important ones to achieve different model capacity for inputs with diverse difficulty levels. based on this conception, we present ds-cnn++ and ds-vit++, by carefully designing the double headed dynamic gate and the overall network architecture. we further propose dynamic idle slicing to address the drastic reduction of embedding dimension in ds-vit++. to ensure sub-network generality and routing fairness, we propose a disentangled two-stage optimization scheme. in stage i, in-place bootstrapping (ib) and multi-view consistency (mvco) are proposed to stablize and improve the training of ds-cnn++ and ds-vit++ supernet, respectively. in stage ii, sandwich gate sparsification (sgs) is proposed to assist the gate training. extensive experiments on 4 datasets and 3 different network architectures demonstrate our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-art static and dynamic model compression methods by a large margin (up to 6.6%). typically, we achieves 2-4x computation reduction and up to 61.5% real-world acceleration on mobilenet, resnet-50 and vision transformer, with minimal accuracy drops on imagenet. code release: https://github.com/changlin31/ds-net.",AB_0109
"introduction: recent studies in human brain connectomics with multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (mri) data have widely reported abnormalities in brain structure, function and connectivity associated with schizophrenia (sz). however, most previous discriminative studies of sz patients were based on mri features of brain regions, ignoring the complex relationships within brain networks. methods: we applied a graph convolutional network (gcn) to discriminating sz patients using the features of brain region and connectivity derived from a combined multimodal mri and connectomics analysis. structural magnetic resonance imaging (smri) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fmri) data were acquired from 140 sz patients and 205 normal controls. eighteen types of brain graphs were constructed for each subject using 3 types of node features, 3 types of edge features, and 2 brain atlases. we investigated the performance of 18 brain graphs and used the topk pooling layers to highlight salient brain regions (nodes in the graph). results: the gcn model, which used functional connectivity as edge features and multimodal features (smri + fmri) of brain regions as node features, obtained the highest average accuracy of 95.8%, and outperformed other existing classification studies in sz patients. in the explainability analysis, we reported that the top 10 salient brain regions, predominantly distributed in the prefrontal and occipital cortices, were mainly involved in the systems of emotion and visual processing. discussion: our findings demonstrated that gcn with a combined multimodal mri and connectomics analysis can effectively improve the classification of sz at an individual level, indicating a promising direction for the diagnosis of sz patients. the code is available at https://github.com/cxy-scut/gcn-sz.git.",AB_0109
"background: automatic cell tracking methods enable practitioners to analyze cell behaviors efficiently. notwithstanding the continuous development of relevant software, user-friendly visualization tools have room for further improvements. typical visualization mostly comes with main cell tracking tools as a simple plug-in, or relies on specific software/platforms. although some tools are standalone, limited visual interactivity is provided, or otherwise cell tracking outputs are partially visualized. results: this paper proposes a self-reliant visualization system, celltrackvis, to support quick and easy analysis of cell behaviors. interconnected views help users discover meaningful patterns of cell motions and divisions in common web browsers. specifically, cell trajectory, lineage, and quantified information are respectively visualized in a coordinated interface. in particular, immediate interactions among modules enable the study of cell tracking outputs to be more effective, and also each component is highly customizable for various biological tasks. conclusions: celltrackvis is a standalone browser-based visualization tool. source codes and data sets are freely available at http://github.com/scbeom/celltrackvis with the tutorial at http://scbeom.github.io/ctv_tutorial.",AB_0109
"proteins form complex interactions in the cellular environment to carry out their functions. they exhibit a wide range of binding modes depending on the cellular conditions, which result in a variety of ordered or disordered assemblies. to help rationalise the binding behavior of proteins, the fuzpred server predicts their sequence-based binding modes without specifying their binding partners. the binding mode defines whether the bound state is formed through a disorder-to-order transition resulting in a well-defined conformation, or through a disorder-to disorder transition where the binding partners remain conformationally heterogeneous. to account for the context-dependent nature of the binding modes, the fuzpred method also estimates the multiplicity of binding modes, the likelihood of sampling multiple binding modes. protein regions with a high multiplicity of binding modes may serve as regulatory sites or hot-spots for structural transitions in the assembly. to facilitate the interpretation of the predictions, protein regions with different interaction behaviors can be visualised on protein structures generated by alphafold. the fuzpred web server (https://fuzpred.bio.unipd.it) thus offers insights into the structural and dynamical changes of proteins upon interactions and contributes to development of structure-function relationships under a variety of cellular conditions.
