"introduction children's early development is affected by caregiving experiences, with lifelong health and well-being implications. governments and civil societies need population-based measures to monitor children's early development and ensure that children receive the care needed to thrive. to this end, the who developed the global scales for early development (gsed) to measure children's early development up to 3 years of age. the gsed includes three measures for population and programmatic level measurement: (1) short form (sf) (caregiver report), (2) long form (lf) (direct administration) and (3) psychosocial form (pf) (caregiver report). the primary aim of this protocol is to validate the gsed sf and lf. secondary aims are to create preliminary reference scores for the gsed sf and lf, validate an adaptive testing algorithm and assess the feasibility and preliminary validity of the gsed pf. methods and analysis we will conduct the validation in seven countries (bangladesh, brazil, cote d'ivoire, pakistan, the netherlands, people's republic of china, united republic of tanzania), varying in geography, language, culture and income through a 1-year prospective design, combining cross-sectional and longitudinal methods with 1248 children per site, stratified by age and sex. the gsed generates an innovative common metric (developmental score: d-score) using the rasch model and a development for age z-score (daz). we will evaluate six psychometric properties of the gsed sf and lf: concurrent validity, predictive validity at 6months, convergent and discriminant validity, and test-retest and inter-rater reliability. we will evaluate measurement invariance by comparing differential item functioning and differential test functioning across sites. ethics and dissemination this study has received ethical approval from the who (protocol gsed validation 004583 20.04.2020) and approval in each site. study results will be disseminated through webinars and publications from who, international organisations, academic journals and conference proceedings. registration details open science framework https://osf.io/ on 19 november 2021 (doi 10.17605/osf.io/kx5t7; identifier: osf-registrations-kx5t7-v1).",AB_0397
"background: tuberculosis (tb) is a key community health problem in numerous settings, predominantly in sub-saharan africa (ssa). tb is the second most lethal infectious disease worldwide. around 1.6 million people died from tb in 2021. tb prevention and control strategies are difficult to implement in prison, especially in sub-saharan africa, owing to overcrowding and poor ventilation. thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the estimated pooled prevalence of tuberculosis among prisoners in sub-saharan africa.materials and methods: electronic biomedical databases such as google scholar, web of science, pubmed/medline, embase, and science direct were used to systematically explore candidate studies published until december 2022. data extraction was performed using a microsoft excel spreadsheet. the estimated pooled prevalence of tuberculosis was determined using a fixed-effects model. cochrane q-test and i-2 statistics were used to check heterogeneity statistically across different studies. begg's rank and egger's tests were performed to assess evidence of possible publication bias.results: a total of 40 articles involving 59,300 prisoners were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. the pooled prevalence of tuberculosis was 4.02% (95% ci: 2.68-5.36). we found the highest prevalence using gene x pert as a diagnostic method, which was 4.97 (95% ci: 2.22-7.73). there is no evidence of publication bias.conclusion: the outcome of this review revealed a high prevalence of tuberculosis among prisoners in sub-saharan africa. to reach the end tuberculosis strategy by 2030, early identification of cases through screening on entry and periodical active case finding is important. moreover, prevention and prompt treatment after diagnosis must be implemented to limit transmission to the general population.systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#searchadvanced, identifier (crd42023428933).",AB_0397
"identifying high-impact, rare genetic variants associated with specific traits is crucial for crop improvement. the 3,010 rice genome (3k rg) dataset offers a valuable resource for discovering genomic regions with potential applications in crop breeding. we used extreme trait gwas (et-gwas), employing bulk pooling and allele frequency measurement to efficiently extract rare variants from the 3k rg. this innovative approach facilitates the detection of associations between genetic variants and target traits, con-centrating and quantifying rare alleles. in our study, on grain yield under drought stress, et-gwas successfully identified five key genes (ospp2c11, osk5.2, osiro2, ospex1, and ospwa1) known for enhancing yield under drought. in addition, we examined the overlap of our results with previously reported qdty-qtls and observed that osuch1 and osuch2 genes were located within qdty2.2. we compared et-gwas with conventional gwas, finding it effectively capturing most candidate genes associated with the target trait. validation with resistant starch showed similar re-sults. to enhance user-friendliness, we developed a gui for et-gwas; https://et-gwas.shinyapps.io/et-gwas/.",AB_0397
"objectiveto evaluate the impact of research design on the perceived medical treatment effectiveness among researchers, healthcare workers (hcws) and consumers in croatia.methodsa cross-sectional study was conducted from november 2021 to february 2022 using an online survey. the participants were researchers, hcws and consumers from croatia. the survey had six scenarios about the same medical treatment presented within different study designs and in random order. participants were asked to assess on a scale from 1 to 10 if the descriptions presented a sufficient level of evidence to conclude that the treatment was effective.resultsfor researchers (n = 97), as the number of participants and degree of variable control in the study design increased, the perceived level of sufficient evidence also increased significantly. among consumers (n = 286) and hcws (n = 201), no significant differences in scores were observed between the cross-sectional study, cohort study, rct, and systematic review.conclusionthere is a need to implement educational courses on basic research methodology in lower levels of education and as part of continuing medical education for all stakeholders in the healthcare system. trial registration: this study has been registered on the open science framework prior to study commencement (https://osf.io/t7xmf).",AB_0397
"argonaute proteins are instrumental in regulating rna stability and translation. ago2, the major mammalian argonaute protein, is known to primarily associate with micrornas, a family of small rna 'guide' sequences, and identifies its targets primarily via a 'seed' mediated partial complementarity process. despite numerous studies, a definitive experimental dataset of ago2 'guide'-'target' interactions remains elusive. our study employs two experimental methods-ago2 clash and ago2 eclip, to generate thousands of ago2 target sites verified by chimeric reads. these chimeric reads contain both the ago2 loaded small rna 'guide' and the target sequence, providing a robust resource for modeling ago2 binding preferences. our novel analysis pipeline reveals thousands of ago2 target sites driven by micrornas and a significant number of ago2 'guides' derived from fragments of other small rnas such as trnas, yrnas, snornas, rrnas, and more. we utilize convolutional neural networks to train machine learning models that accurately predict the binding potential for each 'guide' class and experimentally validate several interactions. in conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of the ago2 targetome broadens our understanding of its 'guide' repertoire and potential function in development and disease. moreover, we offer practical bioinformatic tools for future experiments and the prediction of ago2 targets. all data and code from this study are freely available at https://github.com/ml-bioinfo-ceitec/hybridetector/.",AB_0397
"next-generation sequencing technologies have opened new avenues for using genomic data to study and develop molecular markers and improve genetic resources. simple sequence repeats (ssrs) as genetic markers are increasingly used in molecular diversity and molecular breeding programs that require bioinformatics pipelines to analyze the large amounts of data. therefore, there is an ongoing need for online tools that provide computational resources with minimal effort and maximum efficiency, including automated development of ssr markers. these tools should be flexible, customizable, and able to handle the ever-increasing amount of genomic data. here we introduce megassr (https://bioinformatics.um6p.ma/megassr), a web server and a standalone pipeline that enables the design of ssr markers in any target genome. megassr allows users to design targeted pcr-based primers for their selected ssr repeats and includes multiple tools that initiate computational pipelines for ssr mining, classification, comparisons, pcr primer design, in silico pcr validation, and statistical visualization. megassr results can be accessed, searched, downloaded, and visualized with user-friendly web-based tools. these tools provide graphs and tables showing various aspects of ssr markers and corresponding pcr primers. megassr will accelerate ongoing research in plant species and assist breeding programs in their efforts to improve current genomic resources.",AB_0397
"backgroundlow- and middle-income countries often lack access to mental health services, leading to calls for integration within other primary care systems. in sub-saharan africa, integration of depression treatment in non-communicable disease (ncd) settings is feasible, acceptable, and effective. however, leadership and implementation climate challenges often hinder effective integration and quality of services. the aim of this study was to identify discrete leadership strategies that facilitate overcoming barriers to the integration of depression care in ncd clinics in malawi and to understand how clinic leadership shapes the implementation climate.methodswe conducted 39 in-depth interviews with the district medical officer, the ncd coordinator, one ncd provider, and the research assistant from each of the ten malawian ncd clinics (note one district medical officer served two clinics). based on semi-structured interview guides, participants were asked their perspectives on the impact of leadership and implementation climate on overcoming barriers to integrating depression care into existing ncd services. thematic analysis used both inductive and deductive approaches to identify emerging themes and compare among participant type.resultsthe results revealed how engaged leadership can fuel a positive implementation climate where clinics had heightened capacity to overcome implementation barriers. effective leaders were approachable and engaged in daily operations of the clinic and problem-solving. they held direct involvement with and mentorship during the intervention, providing assistance in patient screening and consultation with treatment plans. different levels of leadership utilized their respective standings and power dynamics to influence provider attitudes and perceptions surrounding the intervention. leaders acted by informing providers about the intervention source and educating them on the importance of mental healthcare, as it was often undervalued. lastly, they prioritized teamwork and collective ownership for the intervention, increasing provider responsibility.conclusiontraining that prioritizes leadership visibility and open communication will facilitate ongoing malawi ministry of health efforts to scale up evidence-based depression treatment within ncd clinics. this proves useful where extensive and external monitoring may be limited. ultimately, these results can inform successful strategies to close implementation gaps to achieve integration of mental health services in low-resource settings through improved leadership and implementation climate.trial registrationthese findings are reported from clinicaltrials.gov, nct03711786. registered on 18/10/2018. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct03711786.",AB_0397
"light exposure is an essential driver of health and well-being, and individual behaviours during rest and activity modulate physiologically relevant aspects of light exposure. further understanding the behaviours that influence individual photic exposure patterns may provide insight into the volitional contributions to the physiological effects of light and guide behavioural points of intervention. here, we present a novel, self-reported and psychometrically validated inventory to capture light exposure-related behaviour, the light exposure behaviour assessment (leba). an expert panel prepared the initial 48-item pool spanning different light exposure-related behaviours. responses, consisting of rating the frequency of engaging in the per-item behaviour on a five-point likert-type scale, were collected in an online survey yielding responses from a geographically unconstrained sample (690 completed responses, 74 countries, 28 time zones). the exploratory factor analysis (efa) on an initial subsample (n = 428) rendered a five-factor solution with 25 items (wearing blue light filters, spending time outdoors, using a phone and smartwatch in bed, using light before bedtime, using light in the morning and during daytime). in a confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) performed on an independent subset of participants (n = 262), we removed two additional items to attain the best fit for the five-factor solution (cfi = 0.95, tli = 0.95, rmsea = 0.06). the internal consistency reliability coefficient for the total instrument yielded mcdonald's omega = 0.68. measurement model invariance analysis between native and non-native english speakers showed our model attained the highest level of invariance (residual invariance cfi = 0.95, tli = 0.95, rmsea = 0.05). lastly, a short form of the leba (n = 18 items) was developed using item response theory on the complete sample (n = 690). the psychometric properties of the leba indicate the usability for measuring light exposure-related behaviours. the instrument may offer a scalable solution to characterise behaviours that influence individual photic exposure patterns in remote samples. the leba inventory is available under the open-access cc-by license. instrument webpage: https://leba-instrument.org/ github repository containing this manuscript: https://github.com/leba-instrument/leba-manuscript.",AB_0397
"kaplan-meier (km) survival analyses based on complex patient categorization due to the burgeoning volumes of genomic, molecular and phenotypic data, are an increasingly important aspect of the biomedical researcher's toolkit. commercial statistics and graphing packages for such analyses are functionally limited, whereas open-source tools have a high barrier-to-entry in terms of understanding of methodologies and computational expertise. we developed surviver to address this unmet need for a survival analysis tool that can enable users with limited computational expertise to conduct routine but complex analyses. surviver is a cloud-based shiny application, that addresses our identified unmet need for an easy-to-use web-based tool that can plot and analyse survival based datasets. integrated customization options allows a user with limited computational expertise to easily filter patients to enable custom cohort generation, automatically calculate log-rank test and cox hazard ratios. continuous datasets can be integrated, such as rna or protein expression measurements which can be then used as categories for survival plotting. we further demonstrate the utility through exemplifying its application to a clinically relevant colorectal cancer patient dataset. surviver is a cloud-based web application available at https://generatr.qub.ac.uk/app/surviver, that can be used by non-experts users to perform complex custom survival analysis.",AB_0397
"background: apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (atrh) is prevalent and associated with adverse outcomes in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. less is known about the potential role of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition in this high-risk population. in this post hoc analysis of the deliver trial (dapagliflozin evaluation to improve the lives of patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure), we evaluated clinical profiles and treatment effects of dapagliflozin among participants with atrh. methods: deliver participants were categorized on the basis of baseline blood pressure (bp), with atrh defined as bp >= 140/90 mm hg (>= 130/80 mm hg if diabetes) despite treatment with 3 antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. nonresistant hypertension was defined as bp above threshold but not meeting atrh criteria. controlled bp was defined as bp under threshold. incidence of the primary outcome (cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure event), key secondary outcomes, and safety events was assessed by baseline bp category. results: among 6263 deliver participants, 3766 (60.1%) had controlled bp, 1779 (28.4%) had nonresistant hypertension, and 718 (11.5%) had atrh at baseline. participants with atrh had more cardiometabolic comorbidities and tended to have higher left ventricular ejection fraction and worse kidney function. rates of the primary outcome were 8.7 per 100 patient-years in those with controlled bp, 8.5 per 100 patient-years in the nonresistant hypertension group, and 9.5 per 100 patient-years in the atrh group. relative treatment benefits of dapagliflozin versus placebo on the primary outcome were consistent across bp categories (p-interaction=0.114). participants with atrh exhibited the greatest absolute reduction in the rate of primary events with dapagliflozin (4.1 per 100 patient-years) compared with nonresistant hypertension (2.7 per 100 patient-years) and controlled bp (0.8 per 100 patient-years). irrespective of assigned treatment, participants with atrh experienced a higher rate of reported vascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, over study follow-up. dapagliflozin modestly reduced systolic bp (by approximate to 1 to 3 mm hg) without increasing risk of hypotension, hypovolemia, or other serious adverse events, irrespective of bp category, but did not improve the proportion of participants with atrh attaining goal bp over time. conclusions: atrh was identified in >1 in 10 patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction >40% in deliver. dapagliflozin consistently improved clinical outcomes and was well-tolerated, including among those with atrh. registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03619213.",AB_0397
