"molecular dynamics (md) simulation is a powerful computational tool used in biomolecular studies to investigate the dynamics, energetics, and interactions of a wide range of biological systems at the atomic level. gromacs is a widely used free and open-source biomolecular md simulation software recognized for its efficiency, accuracy, and extensive range of simulation options. however, the complexity of setting up, running, and analyzing md simulations for diverse systems often poses a significant challenge, requiring considerable time, effort, and expertise. here, we introduce chaperong, a tool that automates the gromacs md simulation pipelines for protein and protein-ligand systems. chaperong also integrates seamlessly with gromacs modules and third party tools to provide comprehensive analyses of md simulation trajectories, offering up to 20 post-simulation processing and trajectory analyses. it also streamlines and automates established pipelines for conducting and analyzing biased md simulations via the steered md-umbrella sampling workflow. thus, chaperong makes md simulations more accessible to beginner gromacs users whilst empowering experts to focus on data interpretation and other less programmable aspects of md simulation workflows. chaperong is written in bash and python, and the source code is freely available at https://github .com /abeebyekeen /chaperong. detailed documentation and tutorials are available online at dedicated web pages accessible via https:// abeebyekeen .com /chaperong -online.",AB_0306
"autophagy is a primary mechanism for maintaining cellular homeostasis. the synergistic actions of autophagyrelated (atg) proteins strictly regulate the whole autophagic process. therefore, accurate identification of atgs is a first and critical step to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of autophagy. current computational methods can predict atgs from primary protein sequences, but owing to the limitations of algorithms, significant room for improvement still exists. in this research, we propose ensembledl-atg, an ensemble deep learning framework that aggregates multiple deep learning models to predict atgs from protein sequence and evolutionary information. we first evaluated the performance of individual networks for various feature descriptors to identify the most promising models. then, we explored all possible combinations of independent models to select the most effective ensemble architecture. the final framework was built and maintained by an organization of four different deep learning models. experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a prediction accuracy of 94.5 % and mcc of 0.890, which are nearly 4 % and 0.08 higher than atgpred-fl, respectively. overall, ensembledl-atg is the first atg machine learning predictor based on ensemble deep learning. the benchmark data and code utilized in this study can be accessed for free at https:// github.com/jingry/autobioseqpy/tree/2.0/examples/ensembledl-atg.",AB_0306
"phylogenetic tree inference is a classic fundamental task in evolutionary biology that entails inferring the evolutionary relationship of targets based on multiple sequence alignment (msa). maximum likelihood (ml) and bayesian inference (bi) methods have dominated phylogenetic tree inference for many years, but bi is too slow to handle a large number of sequences. recently, deep learning (dl) has been successfully applied to quartet phylogenetic tree inference and tentatively extended into more sequences with the quartet puzzling algorithm. however, no dl-based tools are immediately available for practical real-world applications. in this paper, we propose fusang (http://fusang.cibr.ac.cn), a dl-based framework that achieves comparable performance to that of ml-based tools with both simulated and real datasets. more importantly, with continuous optimization, e.g. through the use of customized training datasets for real-world scenarios, fusang has great potential to outperform ml-based tools. graphical abstract",AB_0306
"background: hsk21542, a novel selective peripherally-restricted kappa-opioid receptor agonist has been proven to be a safe and effective analgesic and antipruritic drug in both in vitro and in vivo studies. we aimed to evaluate its safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in hemodialysis patients over a 1-week treatment period, and to establish the optimal dosage for a further 12-week stage 2 trial. methods: in this multiple ascending dose study, hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to receive hsk21542 (0.05-0.80 mu g/kg), or a placebo three times within 2.5 h at the end of each dialysis session for 1 week. safety evaluations included reports of treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes); pharmacokinetics and efficacy outcomes were also assessed. results: among the 44 screened patients, 41 were enrolled and completed the trial. the overall incidence of teaes was higher in the hsk21542 group compared to the placebo group, with an incidence of 75.0%, 50.0%, 75.0%, and 88.9% in the range of 0.05-0.80 mu g/kg. all teaes were grade 1 or 2 in severity. hsk21542 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics characteristics within the dose range 0.05-0.80 mu g/kg, without drug accumulation after multiple-doses. compared to the placebo, a significant decrease of the weekly mean worst itching intensity numerical rating scale was found in the hsk21542-0.30 mu g/kg group (p = 0.046), but without significant improvement in the skindex-16 score. conclusion: hsk21542 was well tolerated in the dose range 0.05-0.80 mu g/kg in hemodialysis patients. hsk21542-0.3 mu g/kg exhibited promising efficacy in patients with moderate to severe pruritus and warrants a further stage 2 trial. clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier nct04470154.",AB_0306
"in most industrial processes, it is impossible to collect samples of all fault modes, which greatly limits fault diagnosis applications in industrial fields. the fault diagnosis for the inaccessible fault modes having no labeled samples, termed zero-shot fault diagnosis, is quite challenging. this paper proposed an attribute fusion transfer (aft) for zero-shot fault diagnosis. first, we proposed a multi-gaussian assumption for the posterior probability calculation in fault attribute transfer process and theoretically and experimentally proved its feasibility and effectiveness. then, considering the ability difference of various attribute transfer methods to predict the same attribute, we proposed an attribute fusion network, which fuses the bayesian fault attribute transfer and the attribute transfer under the multi-gaussian assumption to attain better attribute transfer ability. finally, aft transfers fault attribute knowledge from accessible fault modes to inaccessible fault modes, thereby getting the ability to identify inaccessible fault modes. a series of ablation experiments and comparative experiments on the tennessee-eastman process were conducted to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of aft fusion structure and the superiority of aft. furthermore, we conducted attribute -level and data-level interpretability analyses to reveal why our proposed aft can obtain excellent zero-shot fault diagnosis ability. codes are available at https://github.com/foryichuanqi/advei-paper-2023.11-zero-shot-fault-diagnosis-by-attribute-fusion-transfergithub.",AB_0306
"topologically associated domains (tads) play a pivotal role in disease detection. this study introduces a novel tads recognition approach named toast, leveraging graph auto-encoders and clustering techniques. toast conceptualizes each genomic bin as a node of a graph and employs the hi-c contact matrix as the graph's adjacency matrix. by employing graph auto-encoders, toast generates informative embeddings as features. subsequently, the unsupervised clustering algorithm hdbscan is utilized to assign labels to each genomic bin, facilitating the identification of contiguous regions with the same label as tads. our experimental analysis of several simulated hi-c data sets shows that toast can quickly and accurately identify tads from different types of simulated hi-c contact matrices, outperforming existing algorithms. we also determined the anchoring ratio of tad boundaries by analyzing different tad recognition algorithms, and obtained an average ratio of anchoring ctcf, smc3, rad21, polr2a, h3k36me3, h3k9me3, h3k4me3, h3k4me1, enhancer, and promoters of 0.66, 0.47, 0.54, 0.27, 0.24, 0.12, 0.32, 0.41, 0.26, and 0.13, respectively. in conclusion, toast is a method that can quickly identify tad boundary parameters that are easy to understand and have important biological significance. the toast web server can be accessed via http://223 .223 .185 .189 :4005/. the code of toast is available online at https://github .com /ghaiyan /toast.",AB_0306
"cancer cell lines are essential in cancer research, yet accurate authentication of these cell lines can be challenging, particularly for consanguineous cell lines with close genetic similarities. we introduce a new cancer cell line hunter (cclhunter) method to tackle this challenge. this approach utilizes the information of single nucleotide polymorphisms, expression profiles, and kindred topology to authenticate 1389 human cancer cell lines accurately. cclhunter can precisely and efficiently authenticate cell lines from consanguineous lineages and those derived from other tissues of the same individual. our evaluation results indicate that cclhunter has a complete accuracy rate of 93.27%, with an accuracy of 89.28% even for consanguineous cell lines, out-performing existing methods. additionally, we provide convenient access to cclhunter through standalone software and a web server at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cclhunter.",AB_0306
"backgroundthe visual sequence logo has been a hot area in the development of bioinformatics tools. ggseqlogo written in r language has been the most popular api since it was published. with the popularity of artificial intelligence and deep learning, python is currently the most popular programming language. the programming language used by bioinformaticians began to shift to python. providing apis in python that are similar to those in r can reduce the learning cost of relearning a programming language. and compared to ggplot2 in r, drawing framework is not as easy to use in python. the appearance of plotnine (ggplot2 in python version) makes it possible to unify the programming methods of bioinformatics visualization tools between r and python.resultshere, we introduce plotnineseqsuite, a new plotnine-based python package provides a ggseqlogo-like api for programmatic drawing of sequence logos, sequence alignment diagrams and sequence histograms. to be more precise, it supports custom letters, color themes, and fonts. moreover, the class for drawing layers is based on object-oriented design so that users can easily encapsulate and extend it.conclusionsplotnineseqsuite is the first ggplot2-style package to implement visualization of sequence -related graphs in python. it enhances the uniformity of programmatic plotting between r and python. compared with tools appeared already, the categories supported by plotnineseqsuite are much more complete. the source code of plotnineseqsuite can be obtained on github (https://github.com/caotianze/plotnineseqsuite) and pypi (https://pypi.org/project/plotnineseqsuite), and the documentation homepage is freely available on github at (https://caotianze.github.io/plotnineseqsuite/).",AB_0306
"recently, the research area of hyperspectral (hs) image change detection (cd) is popular with convolutional neural networks (cnns) based methods. however, conventional cnns-based cd algorithms commonly achieve detection by comparing the deep features extracted from the bi-temporal images at decision level, which often fails to take full advantage of the features extracted by the network at different levels. moreover, there are inevitably substantial redundant features located in non-varying regions in bi-temporal images, which considerably impedes the training efficiency of cnns-based methods. to solve these two problems, we propose a temporal difference-guided hs image cd network, called tdgn specifically, the rich spectral features will be extracted from the bi-temporal images hierarchically, and then the differences between the two images at different levels of the network will be yielded by the elaborated convolutional gated recurrent unit block in the spatial dimension. furthermore, the differences from these different levels will be fused for the final detection. more significantly, to boost the efficiency of the backbone network for feature extraction, the obtained difference at each level is also leveraged to generate variation weights to guide the feature extraction at the next stage. finally, the proposed tdgn can make full use of the temporal difference obtained by the network at different levels while this information is further employed to facilitate the attention and extraction of change features by the network. extensive experiments, implemented on four well-known hs data sets, demonstrate that the proposed tdgn yields an average overall accuracy of 98.67%, 96.74%, 99.36%, and 96.81% on these data sets, respectively, acquiring promising detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. the codes of this work will be available at https://github.com/zhonghaochen/tdgn_master for the sake of reproducibility.",AB_0306
"emotion-cause pair extraction (ecpe) is a recently proposed task that aims to extract the potential clause pairs of emotions and its corresponding causes in a document. in this article, we propose a new paradigm for the ecpe task. we cast the task as a two-turn machine reading comprehension (mrc) task, i.e., the extraction of emotions and causes is transformed to the task of identifying answer clauses from the input document specific to a query. this two-turn mrc formalization brings several key advantages: first, the qa manner provides an explicit pairing way to identify causes specific to the target emotion; second, it provides a natural way of jointly modeling the emotion extraction, the cause extraction, and the pairing of emotion and cause; and third, it allows us to exploit the well-developed mrc models. based on the two-turn mrc formalization, we propose a dual-mrc framework to extract emotion-cause pairs in a dual-direction way, which enables a more comprehensive coverage of all pairing cases. furthermore, we propose a consistent training strategy for the second-turn query, so the model is able to filter the errors produced by the first turn at inference. experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. all the code and data of this work can be obtained at https://github.com/zifengcheng/cd-mrc.",AB_0306
