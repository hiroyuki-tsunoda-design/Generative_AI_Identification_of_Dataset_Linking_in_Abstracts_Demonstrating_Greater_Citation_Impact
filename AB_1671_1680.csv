"multi-elemental and multi-dimensional data are more and more important in the development of data-driven research, as is the case in modern paleontology, in which, in an examination by experts, or some day artificial intelligence, every fossil specimen plays a fundamental role. we here release a dataset of 1550 graptolite specimens representing 113 ordovician to silurian graptolite species or subspecies that are significant in global stratigraphic correlation and shale gas exploration. the dataset contains 2951 high-resolution images and a data table of each specimen's scientific information, including the taxonomic, geologic, and geographic information, comments, and references. our dataset provides images for specialists or laypeople worldwide, is supported by the tool fsidvis (fossil specimen image dataset visualizer), which we developed to facilitate the interactive exploration of the rich-attribution image dataset, and includes a nonlinear-dimension reduction technique, t-sne (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), to project image data into a two-dimensional space to visualize and explore the similarities. our dataset potentially contributes to virtual examinations of specimens, global bio-stratigraphic correlation, and improvement of the shale gas exploration efficiency. all data, images and the spreadsheet are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6688670 (xu, 2022).",AB_0168
"reconstructing visual stimulus from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) is a challenging decoding task for revealing the visual system. recent deep learning approaches commonly neglect the relationship between hierarchical image features and different regions of the visual cortex, and fail to use global and local image features in reconstructing visual stimulus. to address these issues, in this article, a novel neural decoding framework is proposed by using a dual attention (da) hierarchical latent generative network with multiscale feature fusion (da-hlgn-msff) method. specifically, the fmri data are first encoded to hierarchical features of our image encoder network, which employs a multikernel convolution block to extract the multiscale spatial information of images. in order to reconstruct the perceived images and further improve the performance of our generator network, a da block based on the channel-spatial attention mechanism is then proposed to exploit the interchannel relationships and spatial long-range dependencies of features. moreover, a multiscale feature fusion block is finally adopted to aggregate the global and local information of features at different scales and synthesize the final reconstructed images in the generator network. competitive experimental results on two public fmri data sets demonstrate that our method is able to achieve promising reconstructing performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. the codes of our proposed da-hlgn-msff method will be open access on https://github.com/ljbuaa/hldagn.",AB_0168
"unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) have been widely used in various fields. as one of the key technologies in improving the autonomous sensing ability of uav optical sensors, object detection has become a research focus in recent years. since uavs usually navigate at different vertical heights, the object scales and sensor field of view change violently, which brings a great difficulty to the optimization of the model. moreover, when a uav is flying at low level rapidly, it may cause the motion blur phenomenon on objects that are highly dense in position, leading to great challenge for distinction of these objects. to address the extremely tough problems discussed above, we propose an accurate and efficient object detection algorithm, namely, vamyolox. based on yolox, we first redesigned the classification and regression loss function of the model to better conduct classification and localization under complex motion blur and dense scenes. then, we increase another prediction head to detect lots of tiny objects to ultimately improve the detection ability of the model for multiscale objects. finally, we redesigned the neck of the network by introducing the triplet attention module (tam) to find attention regions in scenes with dense objects and in images that cover a large area, accordingly enhancing the features extracted by the backbone network. extensive experiments on the visdrone dataset widely used in the research of uav image object detection show that vamyolox has achieved the state-of-the-art (sota) performance with good interpretability in uav optical sensors captured scenes. on the visdrone-det-test-dev subset, the average precision (ap) of vamyolox is 25.31%, outperforming the previous sota model (cornernet) by 1.88%. on the visdrone-det-val subset, the ap of our method is 29.4%, achieving a highly competitive result with previous sota method (amrnet). not only that, vamyolox achieves a maximum improvement of 2.72% compared to the ap of the baseline model (yolox). in addition, compared with other methods, our method has a significant advantage in speed and can meet the needs of different scenarios. the pytorch code and trained models are available at https://github.com/yangyahu-1994/vamyolox.",AB_0168
"terahertz (thz) has been widely used in radar, remote sensing, atmospheric and environmental monitoring, real-time biological information extraction, and medical diagnosis. however, the long-wavelength property of thz leads to low imaging resolution. due to the expensive nature of experimental equipment and the difficulty of obtaining thz sources, most scientific institutions have difficulty in obtaining large amounts of the thz dataset. in addition, it is difficult for convolution neural networks (cnns) to recover low-resolution complex images because of the phase information contained in the images. in this article, we build a thz imaging system and propose a progressive multiscale augmented neural network (pmann) to address this problem. pmann integrates self-attention and channel attention for image contextual feature extraction by the proposed progressive network. compared with the complex cnn (ccnn) in private cartoon datasets, pmann improves the quantitative metrics on peak signal-to-noise ratio (psnr) by about 18.6%. it also obtains better visual quality than ccnn. moreover, we publicly synthesize the first grayscale image ministthz dataset. compared with swintransformer, pmann improves the psnr by 28.2%. the experimental results on the thz dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better performances than the state-of-the-art (sota) models. our synthetic thz dataset is open at https://github.com/szpxmu/pmann.",AB_0168
"research on affective computing by physiological signals has become a new and important research branch of artificial intelligence. however, most of the research focuses only on the improvement of emotion classification models while neglecting the correlation between subjective emotional labels and implicit electroencephalogram (eeg) feature information. in this study, we proposed an interpretable emotion classification framework based on food images as visual stimuli and a proposed eeg dataset acquired by a portable single-electrode eeg device. then, we construct a multidomain feature extraction method based on sliding time windows, which can effectively extract single-channel eeg features. finally, we chose the extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) model as our classifier in the proposed classification framework. the optimal accuracy of our single-channel eeg classification model was 94.76%, which reached the classification performance of multichannel eeg classification. based on xgboost, we interpret the global and the local emotion feature selection method by calculating shapley additive explanation (shap) values. through the analysis of interpretable methods, we can not only obtain the contribution degree of features from three types of emotional labels (positive, negative, and neutral) but also know whether features have a positive or negative effect on classification results. the source codes of this work are publicly available at: https://github.com/vcmhe/mdf-eeg.",AB_0168
"distortion of polyhedra is frequently used in the structure-property analysis of inorganic materials. the commonly used baur distortion index (bdi) loses efficacy in dealing with equi-length polyhedra. this work provides an online calculator to characterize the polyhedral distortion on the basis of the best fitted idealized polyhedron (bfip) method. this method can determine any subtle change between distorted and corresponding idealized polyhedra. it works by fitting an idealized oriented polyhedron of user-selected type to a collection of center and vertex coordinates on an orthonormal basis. the input only needs the coordinates of the center and ligand atoms. it can be accessed at http://bfip.crystalstructure.cn. the function is demonstrated using a distorted mgo6 octahedron. examples of the application and comparison with the bdi are given, including a tetrahedron, octahedron, eight-vertex triangular dodecahedron/cube and cuboctahedron.",AB_0168
"background: this study aimed to apply eight machine learning algorithms to develop the optimal model to predict amputation-free survival (afs) after first revascularization in patients with peripheral artery disease (pad).methods: among 2130 patients from 2011 to 2020, 1260 patients who underwent revascularization were randomly assigned to training set and validation set in an 8:2 ratio. 67 clinical parameters were analyzed by lasso regression analysis. logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, random forest, decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, neural network, cox regression, and random survival forest (rsf) were applied to develop prediction models. the optimal model was compared with germanvasc score in testing set comprising patients from 2010. results: the postoperative 1/3/5-year afs were 90%, 79.4%, and 74.1%. age (hr:1.035, 95%ci: 1.015-1.056), atrial fibrillation (hr:2.257, 95%ci: 1.193-4.271), cardiac ejection fraction (hr:0.064, 95%ci: 0.009-0.413), rutherford grade >= 5 (hr:1.899, 95%ci: 1.296-2.782), creatinine (hr:1.03, 95%ci: 1.02-1.04), surgery duration (hr:1.03, 95%ci: 1.01-1.05), and fibrinogen (hr:1.292, 95%ci: 1.098-1.521) were independent risk factors. the optimal model was developed by rsf algorithm, with 1/3/5-year aucs in training set of 0.866 (95% ci:0.819-0.912), 0.854 (95% ci:0.811-0.896), 0.844 (95% ci:0.793-0.894), in validation set of 0.741 (95% ci:0.580-0.902), 0.768 (95% ci:0.654-0.882), 0.836 (95% ci:0.719-0.953), and in testing set of 0.821 (95%ci: 0.711-0.931), 0.802 (95%ci: 0.684-0.919), 0.798 (95%ci: 0.657-0.939). the c-index of the model outperformed germanvasc score (0.788 vs 0.730). a dynamic nomogram was published on shinyapp (https://wyy 2023.shinyapps.io/amputation/). conclusion: the optimal prediction model for afs after first revascularization in patients with pad was developed by rsf algorithm, which exhibited outstanding prediction performance.",AB_0168
"in this study, we aimed to develop an invasion-related risk signature and prognostic model for personalized treatment and prognosis prediction in skin cutaneous melanoma (skcm), as invasion plays a crucial role in this disease. we identified 124 differentially expressed invasion-associated genes (de-iags) and selected 20 prognostic genes (ttyh3, nme1, orc1, plk1, myo10, spint1, nupr1, serpine2, hla-dqb2, mettl7b, timp1, nox4, dbi, arl15, apobec3g, arrb2, dram1, rnf213, c14orf28, and cpeb3) using cox and lasso regression to establish a risk score. gene expression was validated through single-cell sequencing, protein expression, and transcriptome analysis. negative correlations were discovered between risk score, immune score, and stromal score using estimate and cibersort algorithms. high- and low-risk groups exhibited significant differences in immune cell infiltration and checkpoint molecule expression. the 20 prognostic genes effectively differentiated between skcm and normal samples (aucs >0.7). we identified 234 drugs targeting 6 genes from the dgidb database. our study provides potential biomarkers and a risk signature for personalized treatment and prognosis prediction in skcm patients. we developed a nomogram and machine-learning prognostic model to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (os) using risk signature and clinical factors. the best model, extra trees classifier (auc = 0.88), was derived from pycaret's comparison of 15 classifiers. the pipeline and app are accessible at https://github.com/enyuy/iags-in-skcm.",AB_0168
"background: robot-assisted arm training is generally delivered in the robot-like manner of planar or mechanical 3-dimensional movements. it remains unclear whether integrating upper extremity (ue) natural coordinated patterns into a robotic exoskeleton can improve outcomes. the study aimed to compare conventional therapist-mediated training to the practice of human-like gross movements derived from 5 typical ue functional activities managed with exoskeletal assistance as needed for patients after stroke. methods: in this randomized, single-blind, noninferiority trial, patients with moderate-to-severe ue motor impairment due to subacute stroke were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 20 sessions of 45-minute exoskeleton-assisted anthropomorphic movement training or conventional therapy. treatment allocation was masked from independent assessors, but not from patients or investigators. the primary outcome was the change in the fugl-meyer assessment for upper extremity from baseline to 4 weeks against a prespecified noninferiority margin of 4 points. superiority would be tested if noninferiority was demonstrated. post hoc subgroup analyses of baseline characteristics were performed for the primary outcome. results: between june 2020 and august 2021, totally 80 inpatients (67 [83.8%] males; age, 51.9 +/- 9.9 years; days since stroke onset, 54.6 +/- 38.0) were enrolled, randomly assigned to the intervention, and included in the intention-totreat analysis. the mean fugl-meyer assessment for upper extremity change in exoskeleton-assisted anthropomorphic movement training (14.73 points; [95% ci, 11.43-18.02]) was higher than that of conventional therapy (9.90 points; [95% ci, 8.15-11.65]) at 4 weeks (adjusted difference, 4.51 points [95% ci, 1.13-7.90]). moreover, post hoc analysis favored the patient subgroup (fugl-meyer assessment for upper extremity score, 23-38 points) with moderately severe motor impairment. conclusions: exoskeleton-assisted anthropomorphic movement training appears to be effective for patients with subacute stroke through repetitive practice of human-like movements. although the results indicate a positive sign for exoskeletonassisted anthropomorphic movement training, further investigations into the long-term effects and paradigm optimization are warranted. registration: url: https://www.chictr.org.cn; unique identifier: chictr2100044078.",AB_0168
"objective mri-negative focal epilepsy is one of the most challenging cases in surgical epilepsy treatment. many epilepsy centers recommend intracranial electroencephalography (eeg) for mri-negative cases, especially neocorti-cal epilepsy. this retrospective study aimed to explore whether intracranial monitoring is mandatory in mri-negative neocortical epilepsy surgery and the factors that significantly influence the decision on whether to perform intracranial recording.methods in this study, consecutive surgical patients with focal mri-negative neocortical epilepsy were recruited. all patients underwent routine preoperative evaluation according to the dedicated protocol of the authors' epilepsy center to determine the treatment strategy. patients were divided into two groups according to the surgical strategy, i.e., a direct group and a stereo-eeg (seeg)-guided group. history of epilepsy, seizure frequency, interictal and ictal eeg data, pet data, pet/mri coregistration data, neuropathological findings, and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors influencing the decision to perform seeg monitoring.results sixty-four patients were included in this study, 19 and 45 of whom underwent direct and seeg-guided corti-cal resection, respectively. at an average follow-up of 3.9 years postoperatively, 56 patients (87.5%) had engel class i results without permanent neurological deficits. surgical outcomes were not significantly different between the direct and seeg-guided groups (94.7% vs 84.4%). pet hypometabolic abnormalities were detected in all patients. there were significant differences between the two groups in the extent of hypometabolism (focal vs nonfocal, p < 0.01) and patho- logical subtype (focal cortical dysplasia type ii vs others, p = 0.03). multivariate analysis revealed that the extent of hypo -metabolism (or 0.01, 95% ci 0.00-0.15; p = 0.001) was the only independent factor affecting the treatment strategy.conclusions careful selection of patients with mri-negative neocortical epilepsy may yield favorable outcomes after direct cortical resection without intracranial monitoring. pet/mri coregistration plays an essential role in the preop-erative evaluation and subsequent resection of these patients. intracranial monitoring is not a mandatory requirement for surgery if the focal hypometabolic areas are consistent with the findings of semiology and scalp eeg. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.8.jns22995",AB_0168
