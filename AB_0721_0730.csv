"introduction: advances in wearable sensor technology have enabled the collection of biomarkers that may correlate with levels of elevated stress. while significant research has been done in this domain, specifically in using machine learning to detect elevated levels of stress, the challenge of producing a machine learning model capable of generalizing well for use on new, unseen data remain. acute stress response has both subjective, psychological and objectively measurable, biological components that can be expressed differently from person to person, further complicating the development of a generic stress measurement model. another challenge is the lack of large, publicly available datasets labeled for stress response that can be used to develop robust machine learning models. in this paper, we first investigate the generalization ability of models built on datasets containing a small number of subjects, recorded in single study protocols. next, we propose and evaluate methods combining these datasets into a single, large dataset to study the generalization capability of machine learning models built on larger datasets. finally, we propose and evaluate the use of ensemble techniques by combining gradient boosting with an artificial neural network to measure predictive power on new, unseen data. in favor of reproducible research and to assist the community advance the field, we make all our experimental data and code publicly available through github at https://github.com/xalentis/stress. this paper's in-depth study of machine learning model generalization for stress detection provides an important foundation for the further study of stress response measurement using sensor biomarkers, recorded with wearable technologies.methods: sensor biomarker data from six public datasets were utilized in this study. exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the physiological variance between study subjects, and the complexity it introduces in building machine learning models capable of detecting elevated levels of stress on new, unseen data. to test model generalization, we developed a gradient boosting model trained on one dataset (swell), and tested its predictive power on two datasets previously used in other studies (wesad, neuro). next, we merged four small datasets, i.e. (swell, neuro, wesad, ubfc-phys), to provide a combined total of 99 subjects, and applied feature engineering to generate additional features utilizing statistical summaries, with sliding windows of 25 s. we name this large dataset, stressdata. in addition, we utilized random sampling on stressdata combined with another dataset (exam) to build a larger training dataset consisting of 200 synthesized subjects, which we name synthesizedstressdata. finally, we developed an ensemble model that combines our gradient boosting model with an artificial neural network, and tested it using leave-one-subject-out (loso) validation, and on two additional, unseen publicly available stress biomarker datasets (wesad and toadstool).results: our results show that previous models built on datasets containing a small number (<50) of subjects, recorded in single study protocols, cannot generalize well to new, unseen datasets. our presented methodology for generating a large, synthesized training dataset by utilizing random sampling to construct scenarios closely aligned with experimental conditions demonstrate significant benefits. when combined with feature-engineering and ensemble learning, our method delivers a robust stress measurement system capable of achieving 85% predictive accuracy on new, unseen validation data, achieving a 25% performance improvement over single models trained on small datasets. the resulting model can be used as both a classification or regression predictor for estimating the level of perceived stress, when applied on specific sensor biomarkers recorded using a wearable device, while further allowing researchers to construct large, varied datasets for training machine learning models that closely emulate their exact experimental conditions.conclusion: models trained on small, single study protocol datasets do not generalize well for use on new, unseen data and lack statistical power. machine learning models trained on a dataset containing a larger number of varied study subjects capture physiological variance better, resulting in more robust stress detection. feature-engineering assists in capturing these physiological variance, and this is further improved by utilizing ensemble techniques by combining the predictive power of different machine learning models, each capable of learning unique signals contained within the data. while there is a general lack of large, labeled public datasets that can be utilized for training machine learning models capable of accurately measuring levels of acute stress, random sampling techniques can successfully be applied to construct larger, varied datasets from these smaller sample datasets, for building robust machine learning models.",AB_0073
"motivation: rna n6-methyladenosine (m6a) in homo sapiens plays vital roles in a variety of biological functions. precise identification of m6a modifications is thus essential to elucidation of their biological functions and underlying molecular-level mechanisms. currently available highthroughput single-nucleotide-resolution m6a modification data considerably accelerated the identification of rna modification sites through the development of data-driven computational methods. nevertheless, existing methods have limitations in terms of the coverage of single-nucleotide-resolution cell lines and have poor capability in model interpretations, thereby having limited applicability. results: in this study, we present clsm6a, comprising a set of deep learning-based models designed for predicting single-nucleotide-resolution m6a rna modification sites across eight different cell lines and three tissues. extensive benchmarking experiments are conducted on well-curated datasets and accordingly, clsm6a achieves superior performance than current state-of-the-art methods. furthermore, clsm6a is capable of interpreting the prediction decision-making process by excavating critical motifs activated by filters and pinpointing highly concerned positions in both forward and backward propagations. clsm6a exhibits better portability on similar cross-cell line/tissue datasets, reveals a strong association between highly activated motifs and high-impactmotifs, and demonstrates complementary attributes of different interpretation strategies. availability and implementation: the webserver is available at http://csbio.njust.edu.cn/bioinf/clsm6a. the datasets and code are available at https://github.com/zhangying-njust/clsm6a/.",AB_0073
"the market for illicit drugs has been reshaped by the emergence of more than 1100 new psychoactive substances (nps) over the past decade, posing a major challenge to the forensic and toxicological laboratories tasked with detecting and identifying them. tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) is the primary method used to screen for nps within seized materials or biological samples. the most contemporary workflows necessitate labor-intensive and expensive ms/ms reference standards, which may not be available for recently emerged nps on the illicit market. here, we present nps-ms, a deep learning method capable of accurately predicting the ms/ms spectra of known and hypothesized nps from their chemical structures alone. nps-ms is trained by transfer learning from a generic ms/ms prediction model on a large data set of ms/ms spectra. we show that this approach enables a more accurate identification of nps from experimentally acquired ms/ms spectra than any existing method. we demonstrate the application of nps-ms to identify a novel derivative of phencyclidine (pcp) within an unknown powder seized in denmark without the use of any reference standards. we anticipate that nps-ms will allow forensic laboratories to identify more rapidly both known and newly emerging nps. nps-ms is available as a web server at https://nps-ms.ca/, which provides ms/ms spectra prediction capabilities for given nps compounds. additionally, it offers ms/ms spectra identification against a vast database comprising approximately 8.7 million predicted nps compounds from darknps and 24.5 million predicted esi-qtof-ms/ms spectra for these compounds.",AB_0073

"generative adversarial network (gan) is one of the state-of-the-art generative models for realistic image synthesis. while training and evaluating gan becomes increasingly important, the current gan research ecosystem does not provide reliable benchmarks for which the evaluation is conducted consistently and fairly. furthermore, because there are few validated gan implementations, researchers devote considerable time to reproducing baselines. we study the taxonomy of gan approaches and present a new open-source library named studiogan. studiogan supports 7 gan architectures, 9 conditioning methods, 4 adversarial losses, 12 regularization modules, 3 differentiable augmentations, 7 evaluation metrics, and 5 evaluation backbones. with our training and evaluation protocol, we present a large-scale benchmark using various datasets (cifar10, imagenet, afhqv2, ffhq, and baby/papa/granpa-imagenet) and 3 different evaluation backbones (inceptionv3, swav, and swin transformer). unlike other benchmarks used in the gan community, we train representative gans, including biggan and stylegan series in a unified training pipeline and quantify generation performance with 7 evaluation metrics. the benchmark evaluates other cutting-edge generative models (e.g., stylegan-xl, adm, maskgit, and rq-transformer). studiogan provides gan implementations, training, and evaluation scripts with the pre-trained weights. studiogan is available at https://github.com/postech-cvlab/pytorch-studiogan.",AB_0073
"accurately estimating the human inner-body under clothing is very important for body measurement, virtual try-on and vr/ar applications. in this article, we propose the first method to allow everyone to easily reconstruct their own 3d inner-body under daily clothing from a self-captured video with the mean reconstruction error of 0.73cm within 15s. this avoids privacy concerns arising from nudity or minimal clothing. specifically, we propose a novel two-stage framework with a semantic-guided undressing network (sunet) and an intra-inter transformer network (iitnet). sunet learns semantically related body features to alleviate the complexity and uncertainty of directly estimating 3d inner-bodies under clothing. iitnet reconstructs the 3d inner-body model by making full use of intra-frame and inter-frame information, which addresses the misalignment of inconsistent poses in different frames. experimental results on both public datasets and our collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. the code and dataset is available for research purposes at http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/inner-body",AB_0073
"background: although periconception vaccination is important for maternal and neonatal health, vaccine hesitancy could pose a chal-lenge to achieving a healthy pregnancy in infertile women. we assessed the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) booster vaccination, associated factors, adverse event after vaccination, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection among women seeking fertility treatment. methods: we used the data from participants of the pregnancy and urban environ-ment study (prune study), which is a prospective observational study designed to explore the association between pregnancy and the urban environment in infertile couples. from october 2019 to september 2021, a total of 534 patients provided informed consent and participated in the first and second rounds of a mobile survey conducted at six-month intervals. in the second and third rounds of the survey, we included questions about covid-19 vaccination and sars-cov-2 infection. adjusted risk ratios (arr) were calculated for covid-19 booster vaccination and sars-cov-2 infection. results: all the women participating in the survey had completed the pri-mary series of covid-19 vaccination. the booster vaccination rate was 38.5%, and the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection was 34.4%. the likelihood of receiving a booster vaccination was higher when women reported alcohol consumption (arr = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.03-3.51, p = 0.041). sars-cov-2 infection was inversely associated with nulliparity (arr = 0.44, 95% ci: 0.17-1.09, p = 0.077). among the women vaccinated against covid-19, 44.3% of respondents reported at least one adverse reaction after receiving the vaccine. conclusions: all the women participating in the survey had completed primary series of covid-19 vaccination. the booster vaccination rate was 38.5%, and the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection was 34.4%. among the vaccinated women, 44.3% reported experiencing at least one adverse reaction after receiving the covid-19 vaccine. fever/chilling was the most common (61.8%), followed by abnormal vaginal bleeding/menstrual irregularity (41.8%). a targeted education program by health professionals is needed to promote the benefits of periconception vaccination and reduce the resistance to the covid-19 vaccine among infertile couples. clin-ical trial registration: the study was registered at clinical research information service (https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/info/dataset.do), registration number: kct0003560.",AB_0073
"neural network quantization aims to reduce the model size, computational complexity, and memory consumption by mapping weights and activations from full-precision to low-precision. however, many existing quantization methods, either post-training with calibration or quantization-aware training with fine-tuning, require original data for better performance, which may not be available due to confidentiality or privacy constraints. this lack of data can lead to a significant decline in performance. in this paper, we propose a universal and effective method called generative data free model quantization with knowledge matching for classification(kmdfq) that removes the dependence on data for neural network quantization. to achieve this, we propose a knowledge matching generator that produces meaningful fake data based on the latent knowledge in the pre-trained model, including classification boundary knowledge and data distribution information. based on this generator, we propose a fake-data driven data free quantization method that uses the generated data to take advantage of the latent knowledge for quantization. furthermore, we introduce mean square error alignment during the fine-tuning of the quantized model to more strictly and directly learn knowledge, making it more suitable for data free quantization. extensive experiments on image classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving higher accuracy than existing data free quantization methods, particularly as the quantization bit decreases. for example, on imagenet, the 4-bit data free quantized resnet-18 has less than a 1.2% accuracy decline compared to quantization with real data. the source code is available at https://github.com/zshsh98/kmdfq.",AB_0073

"conventional knowledge graph completion (kgc) methods typically map entities and relations to a unified space through the shared mapping matrix, and then interact with entities and relations to infer the missing items in the knowledge graph. although this shared mapping matrix considers the suitability of all triplets, it neglects the specificity of each triplet. to solve this problem, we dynamically learn one information distributor for each triplet to exchange its specific information. in this paper, we propose a novel triplet distributor network (tdn) for the knowledge graph completion task. specifically, we adaptively learn one triplet distributor (td) for each triplet to assist the interaction between the entity and relation. furthermore, on the basis of td, we creatively design the information exchange layer to dynamically propagate the information of the entity and relation, thus mutually enhancing entity and relation representations. except for several commonly-used knowledge graph datasets, we still implement the link prediction task on the social-relational and medical datasets to test the proposed method. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than existing state-of-the-art kgc methods. the source codes of this paper are available at https://github.com/tdn for knowledge graph completion.git.",AB_0073
