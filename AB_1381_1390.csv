"sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item the user will interact with based on his/her historical interaction sequences. existing sequential recommendation methods mainly use self-attention to capture the preferences with individual user-item historical interaction sequences, while ignoring the group preferences that are exhibited by all user-item interaction sequences. besides, like general recommendation, data sparsity remains the main factor detrimentally affecting recommendation performance. to remedy the damage of data sparsity and improve the recommendation performance, we employ residual connections and graph neural networks based on markov chain to propose mc-rgn, which incorporates group preferences into a single user-item historical sequence. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets, movielens, sports, yelp and beauty. experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved an average improvement of 14.32% on hit@10 and 27.17% on ndcg@10 compared to the baseline models. to showcase whether the proposed method alleviates the negative impact of data sparsity on recommendation performance, we compared the recommendation performance decline of the sasrec and the proposed method under various levels of data sparsity. the results indicate that the proposed method notably reduced the damage caused by data sparsity (0.07% vs 20.94%, 2.37% vs 23.70%, 6.51% vs 27.01%, and 22.78% vs 28.42% at data usage ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%, respectively). finally, our proposed model is available via https://github.com/crx1729/mc-rgn.",AB_0139
"surface solar radiation (ssr) is an essential factor in the flow of surface energy, enabling accurate capturing of long-term climate change and understanding of the energy balance of earth's atmosphere system. however, the long-term trend estimation of ssr is subject to significant uncertainties due to the temporal inhomogeneity and the uneven spatial distribution of in situ observations. this paper develops an observational integrated and homogenized global terrestrial (except for antarctica) station ssr dataset (ssrihstation) by integrating all available ssr observations, including the existing homogenized ssr results. the series is then interpolated in order to obtain a 5(degrees) x 5(degrees) resolution gridded dataset (ssrihgrid). on this basis, we further reconstruct a long-term (1955-2018) global land (except for antarctica) ssr anomaly dataset with a 5(degrees) x 2.5(degrees) resolution (ssrih20cr) by training improved partial convolutional neural network deep-learning methods based on 20th century reanalysis version 3 (20crv3). based on this, we analysed the global land- (except for antarctica) and regional-scale ssr trends and spatiotemporal variations. the reconstruction results reflect the distribution of ssr anomalies and have high reliability in filling and reconstructing the missing values. at the global land (except for antarctica) scale, the decreasing trend of the ssrih20cr (-1.276 +/- 0.205 w m(-2) per decade) is smaller than the trend of the ssrihgrid (-1.776 +/- 0.230 w m(-2) per decade) from 1955 to 1991. the trend of the ssrih20cr (0.697 +/- 0.359 w m(-2) per decade) from 1991 to 2018 is also marginally lower than that of the ssrihgrid (0.851 +/- 0.410 w m(-2) per decade). at the regional scale, the difference between the ssrih20cr and ssrihgrid is more significant in years and areas with insufficient coverage. asia, africa, europe and north america cause the global dimming of the ssrih20cr, while europe and north america drive the global brightening of the ssrih20cr. spatial sampling inadequacies have largely contributed to a bias in the long-term variation of global and regional ssr. this paper's homogenized gridded dataset and the artificial intelligence reconstruction gridded dataset (jiao and li, 2023) are both available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21625079.v1.",AB_0139
"3d object detection is a key task in environmental awareness, which plays a vital role in autonomous driving safety. lidars and cameras are widely used sensors that provide complementary information for accurate 3d detection. however, due to the domain difference between the two modalities, it is challenging to leverage their respective strengths and fuse them perfectly. in this paper, an end-to-end detector termed bf3d is proposed, which integrates with the semantic sampling module, geometric point-image mapping module, and bi-directional attention fusion module. specifically, the semantic sampling module incorporates a novel downsampling strategy to preserve more foreground points and pixels. additionally, the geometric point-image mapping module is developed to find geometric correlation pixels of the point and take advantage of the high density of image features. we also introduce a bi-directional attention fusion module to combine useful information from the two modalities by attention mechanism. extensive experiments demonstrate that bf3d outperforms both single-and multi-modal 3d detectors. codes are available at: https://github.com/hustzyj/bf3d.",AB_0139
"contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks such as assembly are widely studied due to their close relevance with social and manufacturing industries. although the task is highly related to vision and force, current methods lack a unified mechanism to effectively fuse the two sensors. we consider coordinating multimodality from perception to control and propose a vision-force curriculum policy learning scheme to effectively fuse the features and generate policy. experiments in simulations indicate the priorities of our method, which could insert pegs with 0.1 mm clearance. furthermore, the system is generalizable to various initial configurations and unseen shapes, and it can be robustly transferred from simulation to reality without fine-tuning, showing the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method. the experiment videos and code will be available at https://sites.google.com/view/vf-assembly.",AB_0139
"purposethis paper aims to study the motion trajectory of the oil seal for shaft in eccentric state and derive equation of lip motion trajectory.design/methodology/approachthis paper analyzes the force during the motion of the eccentric lip by considering the material viscoelasticity, and a cam-plate mechanism is established as an equivalent model for the motion between the shaft and the lip; according to this, the equation of lip motion trajectory is derived.findingsthe trajectory of the lip lags that of the shaft in the eccentric state because the viscoelasticity-affected lip recovery velocity is lower than the shaft recovery speed. the lip trajectory enters the lag phase earlier and the lag phase's duration is longer with the increase of the eccentricity and rotational speed, because the deviation of the recovery velocities between the lip and the shaft will be exacerbated.originality/valueinnovatively, by considering the viscoelasticity of the material, the cam-plate mechanism is used to equivalent the motion of the shaft-lip to derive the equation for the radial motion trajectory of the eccentric lip. the regularity of lip motion is the key to determining the performance of oil seals, and the eccentric lip trajectory research method revealed in this paper provides a research basis for the performance research and optimization of eccentric oil seals.peer reviewthe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-06-2023-0161/",AB_0139
"background: modifications in the gut microbiota may be a crucial factor in the efficacy of canagliflozin (cana) in managing patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). however, the interplay between oral and ocular surface microbiota and this treatment remains poorly explored.aim :this study aimed to assess alterations in the gut, oral, and ocular surface microbiota pre- and post-cana treatment in patients with t2dm.methods :in this 30-day, controlled before-and-after study, 21 treatment-naive patients with t2dm received sole treatment with cana (100 mg/day), and were matched with 10 healthy controls based on gender and age. using 16s rrna sequencing, changes in the gut, oral, and ocular surface microbiota pre- and post-cana treatment were assessed and compared with those of healthy controls. concurrently, diabetes-related clinical parameters were recorded over the study period. the trial was registered in the chinese clinical trial registry (chictr200034878).results a noticeable shift was observed in the gut, oral, and ocular surface microbiota pre- and post-cana treatment. the post-cana treatment gut microbiota was more similar to that of the healthy controls. network correlation analysis revealed that modifications in the gut, oral, and ocular surface microbiota were related to changes in clinical parameters, especially for the ocular surface microbiota.clinical parameters :a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (8.22 +/- 2.19 vs 6.87 +/- 1.09 mmol/l), glycated serum protein [291.00 (264.00, 353.00) vs 275.00 (251.00, 342.50) mu mol/l], hemoglobin a1c (7.39 +/- 1.18 vs 7.12 +/- 1.33%), body mass index (25.32 +/- 2.99 vs 24.83 +/- 2.95 kg/m(2)), systolic blood pressure (129.05 +/- 17.51 vs 123.43 +/- 14.82 mmhg), and urinary creatinine [158.40 (74.75, 219.15) vs 79.70 (56.25, 138.10) mu mmol/kg] levels was noted after 30-day cana monotherapy (p < 0.05).gut microbiome: treatment with cana resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (scfa)-producing bacteria, particularly lachnospiraceae ucg 004, bacteroides, and lachnospiraceae nk4a136 group.oral microbiota :after cana treatment, a significant increase of prevotella and veillonella, both of which are known to be closely associated with scfas, was observed.ocular surface microbiota: post-cana administration, the ocular surface microbiota exhibited the most distinct changes in structure and composition. remarkably, the majority of the increased ocular surface microbiota could produce scfas within the gut microbiota.conclusion :cana effectively improved the dysregulated glucose metabolism in patients with t2dm. this improvement can potentially be attributed to the restoration of balance among the gut, oral, and ocular surface microbial communities.clinical trial registration :https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=56487, identifier chictr2000034878.",AB_0139
"background: the impact of surgical resection of primary (ptr) on the survival of breast cancer (bc) patients with bone metastasis (bm) has been preliminarily investigated, but it remains unclear which patients are suitable for this procedure. finally, this study aims to develop a predictive model to screen bc patients with bm who would benefit from local surgery.methods: bc patients with bm were identified using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database (2010 and 2015), and 39 patients were obtained for external validation from an asian medical center. according to the status of local surgery, patients were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. propensity score matching (psm) analysis was performed to reduce selection bias. kaplan-meier (k-m) survival and cox regression analyses were conducted before and after psm to study the survival difference between the two groups. the survival outcome and treatment modality were also investigated in patients with different metastatic patterns. the logistic regression analyses were utilized to determine significant surgery-benefit-related predictors, develop a screening nomogram and its online version, and quantify the beneficial probability of local surgery for bc patients with bm. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves, the area under the curves (auc), and calibration curves were plotted to evaluate the predictive performance and calibration of this model, whereas decision curve analysis (dca) was used to assess its clinical usefulness.results: this study included 5,625 eligible patients, of whom 2,133 (37.92%) received surgical resection of primary lesions. k-m survival analysis and cox regression analysis demonstrated that local surgery was independently associated with better survival. surgery provided significant survival benefits in most subgroups and metastatic patterns. after psm, patients who received surgery had a longer survival time (os: 46 months vs. 32 months, p < 0.001; css: 50 months vs. 34 months, p < 0.001). logistic regression analysis determined six significant surgery-benefit-related variables: t stage, radiotherapy, race, liver metastasis, brain metastasis, and breast subtype. these factors were combined to establish the nomogram and a web probability calculator (https://sunshine1.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/), with an auc of 0.673 in the training cohort and an auc of 0.640 in the validation cohort. the calibration curves exhibited excellent agreement. dca indicated that the nomogram was clinically useful. based on this model, surgery patients were assigned into two subsets: estimated sur-non-benefit and estimated sur-benefit. patients in the estimated sur-benefit subset were associated with longer survival (median os: 64 months vs. 33 months, p < 0.001). besides, there was no difference in survival between the estimated sur-non-benefit subset and the non-surgery group.conclusion: our study further confirmed the significance of local surgery in bc patients with bm and proposed a novel tool to identify optimal surgical candidates.",AB_0139
"background atopic dermatitis (ad) has increased rapidly with rapid urbanization; however, the treatment options for ad are lacking because the commonly used therapies can only alleviate symptoms. limosilactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri), fn041 is a specific strain isolated from human breast milk, and its protective potential against ad has been confirmed. this study aims to assess the efficacy of maternal consumption of l. reuteri fn041 during late pregnancy and lactation in preventing infantile ad.methods first, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study will be conducted on 340 pregnant females with babies at high risk for ad. these subjects will be randomly divided into four groups of different doses of l. reuteri fn041 (1 x 10(9), 5 x 10(9), and 1 x 10(10 )cfu/d) along with a placebo. the safety and efficacy of maternal use of l. reuteri fn041 for preventing infantile ad will be analyzed, and the most efficient dosage of l. reuteri fn041 will be determined. subsequently, a multicenter cohort study of 500 pregnant females with babies at high risk for ad will be conducted to promote the maternal application of l. reuteri fn041. these subjects will be administered l. reuteri fn041 at the optimal dose determined during the first stage of late pregnancy and lactation, and their babies will be analyzed for ad development. recruitment was initiated in october 2022.discussion the primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of ad at 24 months after maternal consumption of l. reuteri fn041 during late pregnancy and lactation, whereas the secondary outcome is the efficiency of l. reuteri fn041 transfer from the mother's gut to breast milk and then the infant's gut after oral supplementation. this study will demonstrate the efficacy of edible probiotics isolated from breast milk in preventing or treating ad in infants. accordingly, we provide population-based advice for administering specific probiotics for the primary prevention of ad in pregnant females. understanding the underlying mechanisms of probiotic strains derived from breast milk can promote their application in preventing infant diseases associated with intestinal microbiota imbalance and immune disorders.clinical trial registration https://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier [chictr2300075611].",AB_0139
"colorectal cancer (crc) holds the distinction of being the most prevalent malignant tumor affecting the digestive system. it is a formidable global health challenge, as it ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer related fatalities around the world. despite considerable advancements in comprehending and addressing colorectal cancer (crc), the likelihood of recurring tumors and metastasis remains a major cause of high morbidity and mortality rates during treatment. currently, colonoscopy is the predominant method for crc screening. artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising tool in aiding the diagnosis of polyps, which have demonstrated significant potential. unfortunately, most segmentation methods face challenges in terms of limited accuracy and generalization to different datasets, especially the slow processing and analysis speed has become a major obstacle. in this study, we propose a fast and efficient polyp segmentation framework based on the large-kernel receptive field block (lk-rfb) and global parallel partial decoder(gppd). our proposed colonnet has been extensively tested and proven effective, achieving a dice coefficient of over 0.910 and an fps of over 102 on the cvc-300 dataset. in comparison to the state-of-the-art (sota) methods, colonnet outperforms or achieves comparable performance on five publicly available datasets, establishing a new sota. compared to state-of-the-art methods, colonnet achieves the highest fps (over 102 fps) while maintaining excellent segmentation results, achieving the best or comparable performance on the five public datasets. the code will be released at: https://github.com/spectrelwf/colonnet.",AB_0139
"introduction the sars-cov-2 omicron variant has become the dominant sars-cov-2 variant and exhibits immune escape to current covid-19 vaccines, the further boosting strategies are required.methods we have conducted a non-randomized, open-label and parallel-controlled phase 4 trial to evaluate the magnitude and longevity of immune responses to booster vaccination with intramuscular adenovirus vectored vaccine (ad5-ncov), aerosolized ad5-ncov, a recombinant protein subunit vaccine (zf2001) or homologous inactivated vaccine (coronavac) in those who received two doses of inactivated covid-19 vaccines.results the aerosolized ad5-ncov induced the most robust and long-lasting neutralizing activity against omicron variant and ifng t-cell response among all the boosters, with a distinct mucosal immune response. sars-cov-2-specific mucosal iga response was substantially generated in subjects boosted with the aerosolized ad5-ncov at day 14 post-vaccination. at month 6, participants boosted with the aerosolized ad5-ncov had remarkably higher median titer and seroconversion of the omicron ba.4/5-specific neutralizing antibody than those who received other boosters.discussion our findings suggest that aerosolized ad5-ncov may provide an efficient alternative in response to the spread of the omicron ba.4/5 variant.clinical trial registration https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=152729, identifier chictr2200057278.",AB_0139
