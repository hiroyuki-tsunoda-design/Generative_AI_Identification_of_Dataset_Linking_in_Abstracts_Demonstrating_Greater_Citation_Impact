"wildfires exert strong influences on the environment, ecology, economy and public security. however, the existing hourly himawari-8 fire product produced by the japan meteorological agency (jma) presents large uncertainties and is not suitable for reliable real-time fire monitoring in china. to fill this gap, the national satellite meteorological center (nsmc) proposed an adaptive hourly himawari-8 fire product for china based on the original himawari-8 source by employing a dynamical threshold for fire extraction and a database of ground thermal sources. according to the visually extracted reference and consistency check, we found that the nsmc-himawari-8 fire product effectively removed a majority of false fire alarms included in the original himawari-8 fire product. based on a rare field-collected ground reference dataset, we evaluated the reliability of original himawari-8 and nsmc-himawari-8 fire products across china. the overall accuracy of the raw himawari-8 fire product was 54% and 59% (not considering the omission errors), respectively. as a comparison, by identifying more real fire pixels and avoiding a majority of false fire alarms, the overall accuracy of the nsmc-himawari-8 fire product was 80% and 84% (not considering the omission errors), respectively, making it an ideal source for improved real-time fire monitoring across china. this research also provides a useful reference for employing a local dataset of underlying surfaces and thermal sources to enhance the accuracy of global fire products in specific regions. the nsmc-himawari-8 fire product can be downloaded at http://figshare.com (last access: 17 april 2023) with the following doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21550248 (chen et al., 2022a).",AB_0174
"the cancer prognosis on gigapixel whole-slide images (wsis) has always been a challenging task. to further enhance wsi visual representations, existing methods have explored image pyramids, instead of single -resolution images, in wsis. despite this, they still face two major problems: high computational cost and the unnoticed semantical gap in multi-resolution feature fusion. to tackle these problems, this paper proposes to efficiently exploit wsi pyramids from a new perspective, the dual-stream network with cross-attention (dsca). our key idea is to utilize two sub-streams to process the wsi patches with two resolutions, where a square pooling is devised in a high-resolution stream to significantly reduce computational costs, and a cross-attention-based method is proposed to properly handle the fusion of dual-stream features. we validate our dsca on three publicly-available datasets with a total number of 3,101 wsis from 1,911 patients. our experiments and ablation studies verify that (i) the proposed dsca could outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in cancer prognosis, by an average c-index improvement of around 4.6%; (ii) our dsca network is more efficient in computation-it has more learnable parameters (6.31m vs. 860.18k) but less computational costs (2.51g vs. 4.94g), compared to a typical existing multi-resolution network. (iii) the key components of dsca, dual-stream and cross-attention, indeed contribute to our model's performance, gaining an average c-index rise of around 2.0% while maintaining a relatively-small computational load. our dsca could serve as an alternative and effective tool for wsi-based cancer prognosis. our source code is available at https://github.com/liupei101/dsca.",AB_0174
"real-time running deep convolutional neural networks on embedded electronics is one recent focus for distracted driving detection. in this work, we proposed frnet, which is a unique, efficient, and real-time architecture. the frnet converts spatially distributed features into depth distribution by a feature reorganization block. this block compresses the volume of backbone, reduces the memory read/write volumes along with multiply-accumulate operations, and extracts key features faster. in addition, a ultra-lightweight backbone was designed, with an atypical reshape strategy. this atypical strategy designed based on pixel-level analysis, for compensating the accuracy decline along with feature reorganization. the proposed frnet (a) over cap offered excellenta real-time performance on low power embedded platforms, and has a competitive accuracy with previous state-of-the-art models. it achieved 97.55% accuracy on the sfd+aucdd-v1, and 99.86% on 3mdad. on an automotive-grade embedded demo board, it costs 16.93 ms per frame and achieved 59 fps. as of today, this is the fastest record for end-to-end distraction detection. experiments revealed (a) over cap the real-time and accuracy are best balanced with frnet. the model is publicly available at https://github.com/congduan-hnu/frnet.",AB_0174
"mycotoxins are likely to be converted into masked forms when subjected to plant metabolism or food processing. these masked forms of mycotoxins together with their prototypes may cause mixture toxicity effects, causing adverse effects on animal welfare and productivity. the structure elucidation of masked mycotoxins is the most challenging task in mycotoxin research due to the limitations of traditional analysis methods. to assist in the rapid identification of masked mycotoxins, we developed a data-driven online prediction tool, mycotoxindb, based on reaction rules. using mycotoxindb, we identified seven masked dons from wheat samples. given its widespread applications, we expect that mycotoxindb will become an indispensable tool in future mycotoxin research. mycotoxindb is freely available at: http://www.mycotoxin-db.com/.",AB_0174
"eocene artiodactyls from asia were considered less diverse and abundant than the contemporary perissodactyls, especially in the eocene faunas from the mongolia plateau and central asia. by contrast, artiodactyls are highly diverse and endemic from the eocene deposits of europe and north america. here we report two new genera and three new species of small- to medium-sized artiodactyls preserved by fragmentary materials from the early and middle eocene of the erlian basin, inner mongolia, china. paraphenacodus gabuniai sp. nov. represents the first record of artiodactyls from arshantan asian land mammal age, and shows some more primitive characters than paraphenacodus solivagus from the middle eocene of the zaysan depression of kazakhstan. although paraphenacodus with generally bunodont teeth shows some similarities with both early eocene tsaganohyus from mongolia and early cebochoerid gervachoerus from europe, its affinities with other artiodactyls remain obscure. two new genera and species, irdinodon bicuspidata gen. et sp. nov. and aliusuellus laolii gen. et sp. nov., from the irdinmanhan alma represent new taxa of lantianiinae and tapirulidae, respectively. irdinodon is characterized by twinned metaconules and entoconids on the upper and lower molars in lantianiines. aliusuellus is characterized by a large size and a distinct ridge raised along the posterolingual side of the paracone to its apex on m2. these new artiodactyl materials from the erlian basin, as well as recently reported tapirulids and bunodont erlianhyus, increase the diversity of the eocene artiodactyls from the mongolia plateau, and provide new clues on the origin and dispersal of some early artiodactyls.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:c154b8b2-3841-4616-8d9e-56878c594b5f",AB_0174
"infrared and visible image fusion is an important branch in the field of information fusion. fused images can provide more comprehensive and objective interpretations of complex scenes with confusing or hidden infor-mation. this paper proposes a novel infrared and visible image fusion method based on domain transform filtering (dtf) and sparse representation (sr). first, infrared and visible images are decomposed using a low-pass filter into base and detail layers, respectively. an sr-based rule is designed to fuse the detail layers. to improve the feature expression ability of a redundant dictionary, we introduce a multiscale detail enhancement technique to preprocess the training data. additionally, a fast but effective rule is proposed based on salient structure extraction and dtf base layer fusion. the structure and border information of source images can be successfully transformed into the fused image. the proposed method can effectively retain the salient structure and edge information of the source images in the fused image. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both subjective visual and objective quantitative evaluations. the source code of the proposed method is released at https://github.com/ixilai/dtf-sr.",AB_0174
"multimodal medical image fusion extracts useful information from different modal medical images and in-tegrates them into one image for a comprehensive and objective lesion description. however, existing methods ignore the simultaneous retention of significant edge and energy information that reflect lesion characteristics in medical images; this affects the application value of medical image fusion in computer aided diagnosis. this paper proposes a novel medical image fusion scheme based on extended difference-of-gaussians (xdog) and edge-preserving. a simple yet effective energy-based scheme was developed to generate the fused energy layer, which helped preserve energy. moreover, the averaging filter was used to generate the detail layers of source images. the fusion of detail layers was considered the combination of significant and non-significant edge in-formation. a rule of the detail layer with a salient edge based on edge extraction operator xdog was proposed to efficiently detect the salient structure of the significant edges, and a spatial frequency energy operator was developed to detect the gradient and energy of non-significant information. the fused result could be recon-structed by synthesizing the fused energy layer and details of significant and non-significant edges. experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms some advanced fusion methods in terms of subjective and objective assessment. the code of this paper is available at https://github.com/jei981214/fgf-and-x dog-based.",AB_0174
"the geometric morphology of retinal vessels reflects the state of cardiovascular health, and fundus images are important reference materials for ophthalmologists. great progress has been made in automated vessel segmentation, but few studies have focused on thin vessel breakage and false-positives in areas with lesions or low contrast. in this work, we propose a new network, differential matched filtering guided attention unet (dmf-au), to address these issues, incorporating a differential matched filtering layer, feature anisotropic attention, and a multiscale consistency constrained backbone to perform thin vessel segmentation. the differential matched filtering is used for the early identification of locally linear vessels, and the resulting rough vessel map guides the backbone to learn vascular details. feature anisotropic attention reinforces the vessel features of spatial linearity at each stage of the model. multiscale constraints reduce the loss of vessel information while pooling within large receptive fields. in tests on multiple classical datasets, the proposed model performed well compared with other algorithms on several specially designed criteria for vessel segmentation. dmf-au is a high-performance, lightweight vessel segmentation model. the source code is at https://github.com/tyb311/dmf-au.",AB_0174
"this study proposes a swin transformer for tobacco detection (swintd) to detect foreign objects in the cut section of tobacco packets. swintd uses a swin transformer to model the relationship between foreign objects and the background. meanwhile, a local enhancement block is proposed to enhance the global modeling ability. then, the swin transformer d-block is proposed, which introduces dense connections, increases the reuse of features, and avoids overfitting. subsequently, the feature pyramid network (fpn) is adopted to fuse the multi-stage feature maps of the swin transformer. experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an ap50 of 96.4% with the backbone network swin-t in a cut-section dataset of tobacco packets. also, the robustness and feasibility of the network are verified on two public datasets, namely the neu-det dataset and the rubber lumber dataset. the proposed method achieves an ap50 of 72.2% and 88.6% with the backbone network swin-b. the datasets and program code used in this paper are available at https://github.com/qdlgarim.",AB_0174
