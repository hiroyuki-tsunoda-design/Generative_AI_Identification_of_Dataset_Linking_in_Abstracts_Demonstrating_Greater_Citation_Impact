"heterogeneous graphs, which contain nodes and edges of multiple types, are prevalent in various domains, including bibliographic networks, social media, and knowledge graphs. as a fundamental task in analyzing heterogeneous graphs, relevance measure aims to calculate the relevance between two objects of different types, which has been used in many applications such as web search, recommendation, and community detection. most of existing relevance measures focus on homogeneous networks where objects are of the same type, and a few measures are developed for heterogeneous graphs, but they often need the pre-defined meta-path. defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. recently, the graph neural network (gnn) has been widely applied in many graph mining tasks, but it has not been applied for measuring relevance yet. to address the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel gnn-based relevance measure, namely gsim. specifically, we first theoretically analyze and show that gnn is effective for measuring the relevance of nodes in the graph. we then propose a context path-based graph neural network (cp-gnn) to automatically leverage the semantics in heterogeneous graphs. moreover, we exploit cp-gnn to support relevance measures between two objects of any type. extensive experiments demonstrate that gsim outperforms existing measures.

"objective diagnosis and accurate localization of recurrent tumors in cushing's disease (cd) are challenging, especially after multiple transsphenoidal surgeries (tsss) or radiosurgery. even experts face difficulties in detecting these recurrent tumors, and a favorable surgical outcome is not guaranteed. in this report, the authors aimed to determine the usefulness of 11c-methionine positron emission tomography (met-pet) for evaluating patients with recurrent cd with inconclusive magnetic resonance imaging (mri) lesions and to develop a treatment protocol for these cases. methods in this retrospective study of patients with recurrent cd in the period between april 2018 and december 2022, the authors assessed the usefulness of met-pet in determining whether equivocal mri findings were recurrent tumors or postsurgical cavities and deciding further treatment options. all patients had undergone at least one tss, and most had undergone multiple tsss and had pathologically confirmed corticotroph tumors with hypercortisolemia.results overall, 15 patients with recurrent cd (10 females and 5 males) were included, all of whom had undergone met-pet. all patients had been subjected to multiple treatments, including tsss or radiosurgeries. their mri scans demonstrated less-enhanced lesions that were not confirmed as recurrences even with cutting-edge mri because they could not be distinguished from postsurgical changes with confidence. met uptake was positive in 8 patients (9 exami- nations) and negative in 7. following met-pet, repeat tss was performed in 5 patients. corticotroph tumors were iden-tified in all 5 patients, even though one of them had negative met uptake. the met uptake precisely identified a tumor location on the opposite side of the mri-suspected lesion in 2 patients. meanwhile, patients with negative uptake and mild hypercortisolism were only observed. nonsurgical options were also used in other patients: temozolomide (tmz) was administered in 2 patients owing to a prior history of multiple tsss and radiosurgery and the drug-resistant nature of the disease. tmz was highly effective in these patients; their cushing's symptoms ameliorated, and their adrenocortico-tropic hormone and cortisol levels continued to decline. interestingly, met uptake disappeared following tmz treatment. conclusions met-pet is extremely useful for confirming equivocal lesions on mri in patients with recurrent cd and for deciding further treatment options. the authors propose a novel protocol based on met-pet results for treating patients with relapsing cd in whom the recurrent tumors cannot be confirmed with mri. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.5.jns23179",AB_0074
"background:the renovate-complex-pci (randomized controlled trial of intravascular imaging guidance versus angiography-guidance on clinical outcomes after complex percutaneous coronary intervention) demonstrated that intravascular imaging-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) improved clinical outcome compared with angiography-guided pci for patients with complex coronary artery lesions. this study aims to assess whether the prognostic benefit of intravascular imaging-guided procedural optimization persists in patients undergoing pci for left main coronary artery disease.methods:of 1639 patients enrolled in the renovate-complex-pci, 192 patients with left main coronary artery disease were selected for the current prespecified substudy. selected patients were randomly assigned to either the intravascular imaging-guided pci group (n=138) or the angiography-guided pci group (n=54). the primary end point was target vessel failure defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization.results:at a median follow-up of 2.1 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.0 years), intravascular imaging-guided pci was associated with lower incidence of primary end point compared with angiography-guided pci (6.8% versus 25.1%; hazard ratio, 0.31 [95% ci, 0.13-0.76]; p=0.010). this significant reduction in primary end point was mainly driven by a lower risk of cardiac death or spontaneous target vessel-related myocardial infarction (1.6% versus 12.7%; hazard ratio, 0.16 [95% ci, 0.03-0.82]; p=0.028). intravascular imaging-guided pci was independently associated with a lower risk of primary end point, even after adjusting for various clinical factors (hazard ratio, 0.29 [95% ci, 0.12-0.72]; p=0.007).conclusions:intravascular imaging-guided pci showed clinical benefit over angiography-guided pci for left main coronary artery disease in reducing the risk of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03381872.",AB_0074
"skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopic images plays a vital role in early diagnoses and prognoses of various skin diseases. however, it is a challenging task due to the large variability of skin lesions and their blurry boundaries. moreover, most existing skin lesion datasets are designed for disease classification, with relatively fewer segmentation labels having been provided. to address these issues, we propose a novel automatic superpixel-based masked image modeling method, named autosmim, in a self-supervised setting for skin lesion segmentation. it explores implicit image features from abundant unlabeled dermoscopic images. autosmim begins with restoring an input image with randomly masked superpixels. the policy of generating and masking superpixels is then updated via a novel proxy task through bayesian optimization. the optimal policy is subsequently used for training a new masked image modeling model. finally, we finetune such a model on the downstream skin lesion segmentation task. extensive experiments are conducted on three skin lesion segmentation datasets, including isic 2016, isic 2017, and isic 2018. ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of superpixel-based masked image modeling and establish the adaptability of autosmim. comparisons with state-of-the-art methods show the superiority of our proposed autosmim. the source code is available at https://github.com/wzhjerry/autosmim",AB_0074
"background:there are limited data regarding the safety of deferral of percutaneous coronary intervention based on intravascular ultrasound (ivus) findings. the current study sought to compare the prognosis between deferred lesions based on ivus and fractional flow reserve (ffr)-guided treatment decision.methods:this study is a post hoc analysis of the flavour randomized trial (fractional flow reserve and intravascular ultrasound for clinical outcomes in patients with intermediate stenosis) that compared 2-year clinical outcomes between ivus- and ffr-guided treatment decision on intermediate coronary artery lesions using predefined criteria. in both ivus and ffr groups, vessels were classified into deferred or revascularized vessels, and patients were classified as those with or without deferred lesions. vessel-oriented composite outcomes (cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization) in deferred vessels and patient-oriented composite outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, or any revascularization) in patients with deferred lesions were compared between the ivus and ffr groups.results:a total of 1682 patients and 1820 vessels were analyzed, of which 922 patients and 989 vessels were deferred. at 2 years, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of vessel-oriented composite outcomes in deferred vessels between ivus (n=375) and ffr (n=614) groups (3.8% versus 4.1%; hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% ci, 0.47-1.75]; p=0.77). the risk of vessel-oriented composite outcomes was comparable between deferred and revascularized vessels following treatment decision by ivus (3.8% versus 3.5%; hazard ratio, 1.09 [95% ci, 0.54-2.19]; p=0.81) and ffr (4.1% versus 3.6%; hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% ci, 0.56-2.32]; p=0.72). in comparison of patient-oriented composite outcomes in patients with deferred lesions, there was no significant difference between the ivus (n=357) and ffr (n=565) groups (6.2% versus 5.9%; hazard ratio, 1.05 [95% ci, 0.61-1.80]; p=0.86).conclusions:in patients with intermediate coronary artery stenosis, deferral of percutaneous coronary intervention based on ivus-guided treatment decision showed comparable risk of clinical events with ffr-guided treatment decision.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct02673424.",AB_0074
"the kegg database and analysis tools (https://www.kegg.jp) have been developed mostly for understanding genes and genomes of cellular organisms. the ko (kegg orthology) dataset, which is a collection of functional orthologs, plays the role of linking genes in the genome to pathways and other molecular networks, enabling kegg mapping to uncover hidden features in the genome. although viruses were part of kegg for some time, they were not fully integrated in the kegg analysis tools, because the ko assignment rate is very low for virus genes. to supplement kos a new dataset named virus ortholog clusters (vocs) is computationally generated, covering 90% of viral proteins in kegg. vocs can be used, in place of kos, for taxonomy mapping to uncover relationships of sequence similarity groups and taxonomic groups and for identifying conserved gene orders in virus genomes. furthermore, selected vocs are used to define tentative kos for characterizing protein functions. here an overview of kegg tools is presented focusing on these extensions for viral protein analysis.",AB_0074
"background:hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke reduces the efficacy of stroke thrombolysis and thrombectomy, with worse clinical outcomes. insulin-based therapies are difficult to implement and may cause hypoglycemia. we investigated whether exenatide, a glp-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist, would improve stroke outcomes, and control poststroke hyperglycemia with minimal hypoglycemia.methods:the texais trial (treatment with exenatide in acute ischemic stroke) was an international, multicenter, phase 2 prospective randomized clinical trial (probe [prospective randomized open blinded end-point] design) enrolling adult patients with acute ischemic stroke <= 9 hours of stroke onset to receive exenatide (5 mu g bid subcutaneous injection) or standard care for 5 days, or until hospital discharge (whichever sooner). the primary outcome (intention to treat) was the proportion of patients with >= 8-point improvement in national institutes of health stroke scale score (or national institutes of health stroke scale scores 0-1) at 7 days poststroke. safety outcomes included death, episodes of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and adverse event.results:from april 2016 to june 2021, 350 patients were randomized (exenatide, n=177, standard care, n=173). median age, 71 years (interquartile range, 62-79), median national institutes of health stroke scale score, 4 (interquartile range, 2-8). planned recruitment (n=528) was stopped early due to covid-19 disruptions and funding constraints. the primary outcome was achieved in 97 of 171 (56.7%) in the standard care group versus 104 of 170 (61.2%) in the exenatide group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22 [95% ci, 0.79-1.88]; p=0.38). no differences in secondary outcomes were observed. the per-patient mean daily frequency of hyperglycemia was significantly less in the exenatide group across all quartiles. no episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded over the treatment period. adverse events of mild nausea and vomiting occurred in 6 (3.5%) exenatide patients versus 0 (0%) standard care with no withdrawal.conclusions:treatment with exenatide did not reduce neurological impairment at 7 days in patients with acute ischemic stroke. exenatide did significantly reduce the frequency of hyperglycemic events, without hypoglycemia, and was safe to use. larger acute stroke trials using glp-1 agonists such as exenatide should be considered.registration:url: www.australianclinicaltrials.gov.au; unique identifier: actrn12617000409370. url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03287076.",AB_0074
"background fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (fop) is an ultrarare genetic disorder with episodic and progressive heterotopic ossification. tissue trauma is a major risk factor for flareups, heterotopic ossification (ho), and loss of mobility in patients with fop. the international clinical council on fop generally recommends avoiding surgery in patients with fop unless the situation is life-threatening, because soft tissue injury can trigger an fop flareup. surprisingly little is known about flareups, ho formation, and loss of mobility after fractures of the normotopic (occurring in the normal place, distinct from heterotopic) skeleton when treated nonoperatively in patients with fop. questions/purposes (1) what proportion of fractures had radiographic evidence of union (defined as radiographic evidence of healing at 6 weeks) or nonunion (defined as the radiographic absence of a bridging callus at 3 years after the fracture)? (2) what proportion of patients had clinical symptoms of an fop flareup because of the fracture (defined by increased pain or swelling at the fracture site within several days after closed immobilization)? (3) what proportion of patients with fractures had radiographic evidence of ho? (4) what proportion of patients lost movement after a fracture? methods we retrospectively identified 36 patients with fop from five continents who sustained 48 fractures of the normotopic skeleton from january 2001 to february 2021, who were treated nonoperatively, and who were followed for a minimum of 18 months after the fracture and for as long as 20 years, depending on when they sustained their fracture during the study period. five patients (seven fractures) were excluded from the analysis to minimize cotreatment bias because these patients were enrolled in palovarotene clinical trials (nct02190747 and nct03312634) at the time of their fractures. thus, we analyzed 31 patients (13 male, 18 female, median age 22 years, range 5 to 57 years) who sustained 41 fractures of the normotopic skeleton that were treated nonoperatively. patients were analyzed at a median follow-up of 6 years (range 18 months to 20 years), and none was lost to follow-up. clinical records for each patient were reviewed by the referring physicianauthor and the following data for each fracture were recorded: biological sex, acvr1 gene pathogenic variant, age at the time of fracture, fracture mechanism, fracture location, initial treatment modality, prednisone use at the time of the fracture as indicated in the fop treatment guidelines for flare prevention (2 mg/kg once daily for 4 days), patient-reported flareups (episodic inflammatory lesions of muscle and deep soft connective tissue characterized variably by swelling, escalating pain, stiffness, and immobility) after the fracture, follow-up radiographs of the fracture if available, ho formation (yes or no) as a result of the fracture determined at a minimum of 6 weeks after the fracture, and patient-reported loss of motion at least 6 months after and as long as 20 years after the fracture. postfracture radiographs were available in 76% (31 of 41) of fractures in 25 patients and were independently reviewed by the referring physicianauthor and senior author for radiographic criteria of fracture healing and ho. results radiographic healing was noted in 97% (30 of 31) of fractures at 6 weeks after the incident fracture. painless nonunion was noted in one patient who sustained a displaced patellar fracture and ho. in seven percent (three of 41) of fractures, patients reported increased pain or swelling at or near the fracture site within several days after fracture immobilization that likely indicated a site-specific fop flareup. the same three patients reported a residual loss of motion 1 year after the fracture compared with their prefracture status. ho developed in 10% (three of 31) of the fractures for which follow-up radiographs were available. patient-reported loss of motion occurred in 10% (four of 41) of fractures. two of the four patients reported noticeable loss of motion and the other two patients reported that the joint was completely immobile (ankylosis). conclusion most fractures treated nonoperatively in individuals with fop healed with few flareups, little or no ho, and preservation of mobility, suggesting an uncoupling of fracture repair and ho, which are two inflammation-induced processes of endochondral ossification. these findings underscore the importance of considering nonoperative treatment for fractures in individuals with fop. physicians who treat fractures in patients with fop should consult with a member of the international clinical council listed in the fop treatment guidelines (https://www.iccfop.org).",AB_0074
"motivation the precise characterization of cell-type transcriptomes is pivotal to understanding cellular lineages, deconvolution of bulk transcriptomes, and clinical applications. single-cell rna sequencing resources like the human cell atlas have revolutionised cell-type profiling. however, challenges persist due to data heterogeneity and discrepancies across different studies. one limitation of prevailing tools such as cibersortx is their inability to address hierarchical data structures and handle nonoverlapping gene sets across samples, relying on filtering or imputation.results here, we present cellsig, a bayesian sparse multilevel model designed to improve signature estimation by adjusting data for multilevel effects and modelling for gene-set sparsity. our model is tailored to large-scale, heterogeneous pseudobulk and bulk rna sequencing data collections with nonoverlapping gene sets. we tested the performances of cellsig on a novel curated human bulk cell-type catalogue, which harmonizes 1435 samples across 58 datasets. we show that cellsig significantly enhances cell-type marker gene ranking performance. this approach is valuable for cell-type signature selection, with implications for marker gene validation, single-cell annotation, and deconvolution benchmarks.availability and implementation codes and the interactive app are available at https://github.com/stemangiola/cellsig; and the database is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7582421.",AB_0074
"background parenchymal enhancement (bpe) quantification in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dce-mri) plays a pivotal role in clinical breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. however, the emerging deep learning-based breast fibroglandular tissue segmentation, a crucial step in automated bpe quantification, often suffers from limited training samples with accurate annotations. to address this challenge, we propose a novel iterative cycle-consistent semi-supervised framework to leverage segmentation performance by using a large amount of paired pre-/post-contrast images without annotations. specifically, we design the reconstruction network, cascaded with the segmentation network, to learn a mapping from the pre-contrast images and segmentation predictions to the post-contrast images. thus, we can implicitly use the reconstruction task to explore the inter-relationship between these two-phase images, which in return guides the segmentation task. moreover, the reconstructed post-contrast images across multiple auto-context modeling-based iterations can be viewed as new augmentations, facilitating cycle-consistent constraints across each segmentation output. extensive experiments on two datasets with various data distributions show great segmentation and bpe quantification accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. importantly, our method achieves 11.80 times of quantification accuracy improvement along with 10 times faster, compared with clinical physicians, demonstrating its potential for automated bpe quantification. the code is available at https://github.com/zhangjd-ong/iterative-cycle-consistent-semi-supervised-learning-for-fibroglandular-tissue-segmentation.",AB_0074
