"zinc finger (znf) is an important class of nucleic acid and protein recognition domain, wherein, zinc ion is the inorganic co-factor that forms a tetrahedral geometry with the cysteine and/or histidine residues. znf domains take up diverse architectures with different znf motifs and have a wide range of biological functions. nonetheless, predicting the znf motif(s) from the sequence is quite challenging. to this end, 74 unique znf sequence patterns are collected from the literature and classified into 32 different classes. since the shorter length of znf sequence patterns leads to inaccurate predictions, znf domain pfam hmm profiles defined under 6 znf pfam clans (215 hmm profiles) and a few undefined pfam clans (74 hmm profiles) are used for the prediction. a web server, namely, znf-prot ( https://project.iith.ac.in/znprot/ ) is developed which can predict the presence of 31 znf domains in a protein/proteome sequence of any organism. the use of znf sequence patterns and pfam hmm profiles resulted in an accurate prediction of 610 test cases (taken randomly from 249 organisms) considered here. additionally, the application of znf-prot is demonstrated by considering arabidopsis thaliana, homo sapiens, saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans and ciona intestinalis proteomes as test cases, wherein, 87-96% of the predicted znf motifs are cross-validated.

"credit card churn prediction, insurance fraud detection, and loan default prediction are all critical analytical customer relationship management (acrm) problems. since these events occur infrequently, datasets for these problems are highly unbalanced. consequently, when trained on such unbalanced datasets, all machine learning classifiers tend to produce high false positive rates. we propose two methods for data balancing. to oversample the minority class, we proposed an innovative gan called chaoticgan, where we employed chaotic noise as input for the generator. we also employed the traditional gan (goodfellow et al. in adv neural inf process syst, 2014. ), wasserstein gan (arjovsky et al. in wasserstein gan, 2017. https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875), and ctgan (xu et al. in modeling tabular data using conditional gan. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503) independently for baseline comparison. on the data balanced by gans, we employed a host of machine learning classifiers, including random forest, decision tree, support vector machine (svm), logistic regression (lr), multi-layer perceptron (mlp) and light gradient boosting machine (lgbm) to demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches. in the second approach, we augment the oversampled synthetic minority class data obtained by gan and its variants with the undersampled majority class data obtained by one class support vector machine (ocsvm) (tax et al. in mach learn 54:45-66, 2014). we passed the entire modified dataset to build the classifiers. our proposed approaches outperform earlier studies on the same datasets in terms of the area under the roc curve (auc). further, our proposed chaoticgan and its hybrid turned out to be statistically similar to the state-of-the-art ctgan on all datasets while being significant over other methods w.r.t auc over tenfold cross-validation.",AB_0064
"image retrieval is a way to search similar images from a given query image. the method successfully applied to different fashion image retrieval over different garments and footwear. however, research over complex fashion products such as ornaments have not got much momentum due to the complex nature of similarity and unavailability of suitable datasets. in this paper we have proposed a dual shallow siamese network (dssn) for the task. the model has two identical siamese networks and takes the same images as input but in a different representation. one subnetwork takes input as rgb color images and the other as identical segmented images. first, the networks are trained using positive and negative image pairs. next, the trained model is used to find the difference between gallery and query images. the similarity score of the siamese networks are then fused using weighted averaging. the method is applied on two public datasets, namely, ringfir (earring dataset) and ut-zap50k (footwear dataset). we have compared the retrieval accuracy of our method with other state-of-the-art image retrieval methods. the result shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. the source code and dataset is available publicly (https://github.com/skarifahmed/dssn).",AB_0064
"there has been an exponential increase in the design of synthetic antimicrobial peptides (amps) for its use as novel antibiotics. synthetic amps are substantially enriched in residues with physicochemical properties known to be critical for antimicrobial activity; such as positive charge, hydrophobicity, and higher alpha helical propensity. the current prediction algorithms for amps have been developed using amp sequences from natural sources and hence do not perform well for synthetic peptides. in this version of camp database, along with updating sequence information of amps, we have created separate prediction algorithms for natural and synthetic amps. camp(r4) holds 24243 amp sequences, 933 structures, 2143 patents and 263 amp family signatures. in addition to the data on sequences, source organisms, target organisms, minimum inhibitory and hemolytic concentrations, camp(r4) provides information on n and c terminal modifications and presence of unusual amino acids, as applicable. the database is integrated with tools for amp prediction and rational design (natural and synthetic amps), sequence (blast and clustal omega), structure (vast) and family analysis (pratt, scanprosite, campsign). the data along with the algorithms of camp(r4) will aid to enhance amp research. camp(r4) is accessible at http://camp.bicnirrh.res.in/.",AB_0064
"residual network (resnet) achieves deeper and wider networks with high-performance gains, representing a powerful convolutional neural network architecture. in this paper, we propose architectural refinements to resnet that address the information flow through several layers of the network, including the input stem, downsampling block, projection shortcut, and identity blocks. we will show that our collective refinements facilitate stable backpropagation by preserving the norm of the error gradient within the residual blocks, which can reduce the optimization difficulties of training very deep networks. our proposed modifications enhance the learning dynamics, resulting in high accuracy and inference performance by enforcing norm-preservation throughout the network training. the effectiveness of our method is verified by extensive experimental results on five computer vision tasks, including image classification (imagenet and cifar-100), video classification (kinetics-400), multi-label image recognition (ms-coco), object detection and semantic segmentation (pascal voc). we also empirically show consistent improvements in generalization performance when applying our modifications over different networks to provide new insights and inspire new architectures. the source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/bharatmahaur/leno.

"germline and somatic variants within an individual or cohort are interpreted with information from large cohorts. annotation with this information becomes a computational bottleneck as population sets grow to terabytes of data. here, we introduce echtvar, which efficiently encodes population variants and annotation fields into a compressed archive that can be used for rapid variant annotation and filtering. most variants, represented by chromosome, position and alleles are encoded into 32-bits-half the size of previous encoding schemes and at least 4 times smaller than a naive encoding. the annotations, stored separately within the same archive, are also encoded and compressed. we show that echtvar is faster and uses less space than existing tools and that it can effectively reduce the number of candidate variants. we give examples on germ-line and somatic variants to document how echtvar can facilitate exploratory data analysis on genetic variants. echtvar is available at https://github.com/brentp/echtvar under an mit license.",AB_0064
"air is the basis for the existence of life on earth; but in the present age of modernization the degrading quality of air year by year, due to the growth of industrialization, urbanization, automobiles, coal-fired thermal power plants, and various other factories is the matter of real concern. to predict the future growth of air pollutants numerous prediction models have been developed by researchers. time-series arima model although quite useful for forecasting but fails to handle non-stationary problems. among all the existing forecasting models, wavelets along with the machine learning models have proved to be very successful and have been widely used in various fields like mathematical modeling, signal recognition, image recognition, classification, function approximation, data processing, filtering, clustering, compression, robotics, and decision making. it is also used in the field of mathematical forecasting for developing efficient prediction models. this paper aims to develop a wavelet-anfis conjugation model and a wavelet-arima coupled model along with the time-series arima model for the prediction of black carbon concentration over the raniganj, jharia, and bokaro coal mines of india, by considering a long term data obtained by nasa (http://nasa.gov/) and compare the results obtained by these models for determining the best prediction model. the validity of the results is tested with the help of error measures like rmse, mse, mape, mae, and relative error. results over the three sample sites conclude that the wavelet-anfis conjugation approach outperforms the wavelet-arima coupled approach and the simple time-series arima model.",AB_0064
"developing an optical character recognition (ocr) system for handwtexts is a challenging research problem. handwritten text can be largely different even for the same piece of text since the writing style differs from person to person. on the other hand, for many regional languages, unavailability of datasets having a large quantity of varied images is a hindrance for the research advancements. this is especially true for bangla, which is the most widely spoken language of bangladesh and the second most widely spoken language of india. only a few works have been proposed for the generation of handwritten bangla basic characters and almost none related to the generation of handwritten bangla compound characters. to this end, in this work, a method for the generation of synthetic handwritten bangla compound characters is proposed to alleviate this data scarcity. a generative adversarial network (gan) based model is developed for this purpose taking inspiration from the recent auxiliary classifier gan (ac-gan) model. a novel dataset partitioning scheme is also developed for handwritten character related tasks to improve the performance of the model. the quality of generated samples is evaluated in terms of the frechet inception distance (fid) metric. it is observed that the present model performs better in comparison to the basic ac-gan architecture and also in comparison with some present gan architectures. the sample dataset generated as a part of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/hachiro-2001/bengah_compound_characters.",AB_0064
"cervical cancer affects more than 500,000 women in the world annually accounting for about 6-9% of all cancer cases, but, its tedious detection procedure makes population-wide screening impossible. classification of cervical pre-cancerous cells using computer-aided diagnosis tools is a challenging task and is posed an open problem for several decades. the most concerning issue is that only a small amount of data is available publicly. in this study, deep learning along with an evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm called the genetic algorithm is incorporated for cervical cell classification. pre-trained convolutional neural networks, namely googlenet and resnet-18 have been utilized to account for the fewer data available, for extracting deep features from the images. the extracted features are optimized by employing a genetic algorithm for feature selection which is coupled with the support vector machines classifier for the final classification. the proposed method has been validated on two publicly available datasets which obtained promising results on 5-fold cross-validation justifying the framework to be reliable. the relevant source codes for the proposed framework has been provided in https://github.com/rohit-kundu/ cervical-cancer-cnn-gagithub.",AB_0064
"image inpainting is now-a-days sought after due to its wide variety of applications in the reconstruction of the corrupted image, occlusion removal, reflection removal, etc. existing image inpainting approaches utilize different types of attention mechanisms to inpaint the image and produce visibly admirable re-sults. these methods are more concerned at weighing the feature maps of the hole region with some weight from the non-hole region. but, due to the lack of spatial contextual correlation in the atten-tion maps, the inpainted image may suffer from the inconsistencies among hole and non-hole regions. transformer-based inpainting methods give significant results by capturing the relationship between the patches with a compromise of high computational complexity. in this context, we propose a novel spa-tial projection layer (spl) without any attention mechanism to project the spatial contextual information in the hole region from non-hole regions for producing a spatially plausible inpainted image. the spl is proposed mainly to focus on the non-hole spatial information in the high-level feature maps for fill-ing the hole regions efficiently. also, while training the network, we propose the use of edge loss with a canny edge operator for image inpainting to focus on the relevant edges instead of noise contents. analysis with the extensive experiments, ablation, and user study on the proposed architecture demon-strates the superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods for image inpainting. the code is available at: https://github.com/shrutiphutke/spatial _ projection _ inpainting .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0064
