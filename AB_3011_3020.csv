"generative adversarial networks (gans) have successfully generated functional protein sequences. however, traditional gans often suffer from inherent randomness, resulting in a lower probability of obtaining desirable sequences. due to the high cost of wet-lab experiments, the main goal of computer-aided antibody optimization is to identify high-quality candidate antibodies from a large range of possibilities, yet improving the ability of gans to generate these desired antibodies is a challenge. in this study, we propose and evaluate a new gan called the language model guided antibody generative adversarial network (abgan-lmg). this gan uses a language model as an input, harnessing such models' powerful representational capabilities to improve the gan's generation of high-quality antibodies. we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the antibody libraries and sequences generated by abgan-lmg for covid-19 (sars-cov-2) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov). results indicate that abgan-lmg has learned the fundamental characteristics of antibodies and that it improved the diversity of the generated libraries. additionally, when generating sequences using azd8895 as the target antibody for optimization, over 50% of the generated sequences exhibited better developability than azd-8895 itself. through molecular docking, we identified 70 antibodies that demonstrated higher affinity for the wild-type receptor-binding domain (rbd) of sars-cov-2 compared to azd-8895. in conclusion, abgan-lmg demonstrates that language models used in conjunction with gans can enable the generation of higher-quality libraries and candidate sequences, thereby improving the efficiency of antibody optimization. abgan-lmg is available at http://39.102.71.224:88/.",AB_0302
"traditional chinese medicine (tcm) databases play a vital role in bridging the gap between tcm and modern medicine, as well as in promoting the popularity of tcm. elucidating the bioactive ingredients of chinese medicinal materials is key to tcm modernization and new drug discovery. however, one drawback of current tcm databases is the lack of quantitative data on the constituents of chinese medicinal materials. herein, we present cctcm, a web-based platform designed to provide a component and compound-content-based resource on tcm and analysis services for medical experts. in terms of design features, cctcm combines resource distribution, similarity analysis, and molecular-mechanism analysis to accelerate the discovery of bioactive ingredients in tcm. cctcm contains 273 chinese medicinal materials commonly used in clinical settings, covering 29 functional classifications. by searching and comparing, we finally adopted 2043 studies, from which we collected the compounds contained in each tcm with content greater than 0.001 %, and a total of 1449 were extracted. subsequently, we collected 40,767 compound-target pairs by integrating multiple databases. taken together, cctcm is a versatile platform that can be used by tcm scientists to perform scientific and clinical tcm studies based on quantified ingredients of chinese medicinal materials. cctcm is freely accessible at http://www.cctcm. org.cn.",AB_0302
"the systemhc atlas v1.0 was the first public repository dedicated to mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics. here we introduce a newly released version of the systemhc atlas v2.0 (https://systemhc.sjtu.edu.cn), a comprehensive collection of 7190 ms files from 303 allotypes. we extended and optimized a computational pipeline that allows the identification of mhc-bound peptides carrying on unexpected post-translational modifications (ptms), thereby resulting in 471k modified peptides identified over 60 distinct ptm types. in total, we identified approximately 1.0 million and 1.1 million unique peptides for mhc class i and class ii immunopeptidomes, respectively, indicating a 6.8-fold increase and a 28-fold increase to those in v1.0. the systemhc atlas v2.0 introduces several new features, including the inclusion of non-uniprot peptides, and the incorporation of several novel computational tools for fdr estimation, binding affinity prediction and motif deconvolution. additionally, we enhanced the user interface, upgraded website framework, and provided external links to other resources related. finally, we built and provided various spectral libraries as community resources for data mining and future immunopeptidomic and proteomic analysis. we believe that the systemhc atlas v2.0 is a unique resource to provide key insights to the immunology and proteomics community and will accelerate the development of vaccines and immunotherapies. graphical abstract",AB_0302
"background: ciprofol, a novel sedative-hypnotic drug, has been approved for its use in inducing and maintaining general anesthesia, as well as for providing sedation.methods: in this phase i, single-center, parallel, controlled, open-label clinical trial, our objective was to analyze the pharmacokinetics (pk), pharmacodynamics (pd), and safety of ciprofol emulsion in 24 participants with mild and moderate renal impairment (n = 8 per group) and matched healthy participants (n = 8). an initial loading infusion of ciprofol was administered at 0.4 mg/kg for 1 min, followed by a maintenance infusion at a rate of 0.4 mg/kg/h for 30 min. we collected plasma and urine samples from the participants to assess the pk of ciprofol and its metabolite m4. the evaluation of pd involved using a modified observer's alertness/sedation scale (moaa/s) in combination with bispectral index (bis) monitoring. safety assessments were conducted throughout the trial process.results: the plasma concentration-time curve of ciprofol in participants with renal impairment was similar to that in participants with normal kidney function. the area under the curve (auc) and maximum concentration (cmax) of total and unbound ciprofol in plasma for participants with renal impairment were only slightly higher (0.7-1.2-fold) than those in participants with normal renal function. in contrast, for the metabolite m4, auc values were 1.3- and 2.1-fold greater in participants with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively, than in healthy controls. however, renal impairment had no significant impact on the pd parameters. the study found that ciprofol was well-tolerated, with all adverse events (aes) reported being mild or moderate in severity.conclusion: based on these findings, we can conclude that no dosage adjustment of ciprofol is necessary for patients with mild-moderate renal impairment who receive the injection.clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov, identifier nct04142970.",AB_0302
"human leukocyte antigen (hla) is closely involved in regulating the human immune system. despite great advance in detecting classical hla class i binders, there are few methods or toolkits for recognizing non-classical hla class i binders. to fill in this gap, we have developed a deep learning-based tool called deephlapred. the deephlapred used electron-ion interaction pseudo potential, integer numerical mapping and accumulated amino acid frequency as initial representation of non-classical hla binder sequence. the deep learning module was used to further refine high-level representations. the deep learning module comprised two parallel convolutional neural networks, each followed by maximum pooling layer, dropout layer, and bi-directional long short-term memory network. the experimental results showed that the deephlapred reached the state-of-the-art performanceson the cross-validation test and the independent test. the extensive test demonstrated the rationality of the deephlapred. we further analyzed sequence pattern of non-classical hla class i binders by information entropy. the information entropy of non-classical hla binder sequence implied sequence pattern to a certain extent. in addition, we have developed a user-friendly webserver for convenient use, which is available at http://www.biolscience.cn/deephlapred/. the tool and the analysis is helpful to detect non-classical hla class i binder. the source code and data is available at https://github.com/tangxingyu0/deephlapred.",AB_0302
"drug resistance poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment. despite the initial effectiveness of therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, many patients eventually develop resistance. to gain deep insights into the underlying mechanisms, single-cell profiling has been performed to interrogate drug resistance at cell level. herein, we have built the drmref database (https://ccsm.uth.edu/drmref/) to provide comprehensive characterization of drug resistance using single-cell data from drug treatment settings. the current version of drmref includes 42 single-cell datasets from 30 studies, covering 382 samples, 13 major cancer types, 26 cancer subtypes, 35 treatment regimens and 42 drugs. all datasets in drmref are browsable and searchable, with detailed annotations provided. meanwhile, drmref includes analyses of cellular composition, intratumoral heterogeneity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell-cell interaction and differentially expressed genes in resistant cells. notably, drmref investigates the drug resistance mechanisms (e.g. aberration of drug's therapeutic target, drug inactivation by structure modification, etc.) in resistant cells. additional enrichment analysis of hallmark/kegg (kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes)/go (gene ontology) pathways, as well as the identification of microrna, motif and transcription factors involved in resistant cells, is provided in drmref for user's exploration. overall, drmref serves as a unique single-cell-based resource for studying drug resistance, drug combination therapy and discovering novel drug targets. graphical abstract",AB_0302
"long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) possess a wide range of biological functions, and research has demonstrated their significance in regulating major biological processes such as development, differentiation, and immune response. the accelerating accumulation of lncrna research has greatly expanded our understanding of lncrna functions. here, we introduce lncsea 2.0 (http://bio.liclab.net/lncsea/index.php), aiming to provide a more comprehensive set of functional lncrnas and enhanced enrichment analysis capabilities. compared with lncsea 1.0, we have made the following improvements: (i) we updated the lncrna sets for 11 categories and extremely expanded the lncrna scopes for each set. (ii) we newly introduced 15 functional lncrna categories from multiple resources. this update not only included a significant amount of downstream regulatory data for lncrnas, but also covered numerous epigenetic regulatory data sets, including lncrna-related transcription co-factor binding, chromatin regulator binding, and chromatin interaction data. (iii) we incorporated two new lncrna set enrichment analysis functions based on gsea and gsva. (iv) we adopted the snakemake analysis pipeline to track data processing and analysis. in summary, lncsea 2.0 offers a more comprehensive collection of lncrna sets and a greater variety of enrichment analysis modules, assisting researchers in a more comprehensive study of the functional mechanisms of lncrnas. graphical abstract",AB_0302
"recently, there has been a growing interest in the hyperspectral image (hsi) classification methods that employ deep learning techniques in small sample cases. to address issues with network degradation and enhance the extraction of discriminative hsi features, this article proposes a tbta-d2net network utilizing a triple-branch ternary-attention mechanism and dense2net. furthermore, a new deep model optimizer named adan is introduced to improve the training speed of the network model. this article takes spatial information as a two-dimensional vector, extracting spectral features as well as spatial-x and spatial-y features separately in three branches. each branch includes a dense2net bottleneck module and an attention module. classification is achieved by fusing the features extracted from the three branches. experimental results on four public datasets indicate that tbta-d2net can achieve competitive results over state-of-the-art methods. the code is available at https://github.com/teresating/tbta-d2net.",AB_0302
"background: captisol (r)-enabled-fosphenytoin sodium (ce-fosphenytoin sodium) injection is a modified formulation of fosphenytoin sodium.objective: we aim to compare the intravenous and intramuscular bioavailability and safety between ce-fosphenytoin sodium, fosphenytoin sodium (cerebyx (r)), and phenytoin sodium (intravenous injection only).methods: in pivotal study 1, 54 subjects were divided into three sequence groups that receive intravenous injection of 250 mg of phenytoin sodium equivalent (pe), ce-fosphenytoin sodium (t), or fosphenytoin sodium (r1) and 250 mg of phenytoin sodium (r2) in period 1. after a 14-day washout period, 36 subjects were randomized to two treatment sequence groups (t-r1 or r1-t, n = 18 per group) in period 2, in which the subjects who received r2 in period 1 were removed, those who received t in period 1 used r1 (t-r1), while those who previously received r1 used t (r1-t). in pivotal study 2, a single intramuscular dose of t (400 mg pe) or r1 (400 mg pe) was administered according to the individual sequential treatment assignment in each period. there was a washout (14 days) period before receiving the next period study drug.results: t and r1 have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics regarding total and free phenytoin, showing bioequivalence of both drugs in the intravenous and intramuscular administration. the geometric mean ratio was close to 1 (0.98-1.06). the auc of total and free phenytoin in subjects who intravenously received t and r1 was very similar to those who received r2, although their cmax was lower than that of the subjects who received r2. overall, treatment with t and r1 was safe and well-tolerated, without serious adverse events (saes) or grade iii adverse events (aes). with intravenous (i.v.) or intramuscular (i.m.) treatment, the incidence of drug-related aes using t was similar to that using r1. treatment with t and r1 had clearly superior tolerability than that with r2.conclusion: ce-fosphenytoin sodium is a promising substitute for fosphenytoin sodium.clinical trial registration: http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/, ctr20202154 (11 november 2020).",AB_0302
"introduction: randomized, controlled trials of molnupiravir in real-world use during the omicron wave are scarce. the frequency of hospitalization and death is low, so further research is needed to confirm the virological efficacy of molnupiravir.methods: a single-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted, and 111 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1. fifty-three patients in the molnupiravir group were administered 800 mg of molnupiravir twice daily for 5 days in addition to the standard therapy, and 58 patients in the control group only received the standard therapy in accordance with local guidelines. the antiviral effect and adverse events were evaluated during the follow-up.results: the median viral clearance time in the molnupiravir group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (p = 0.003). furthermore, patients who started molnupiravir therapy within 3 days had significantly shorter viral clearance time than the controls (p = 0.003). in the vaccinated subgroup, molnupiravir therapy was also associated with a shorter viral clearance time (p = 0.003). a total of three adverse events, which were minor, were reported in the molnupiravir group. one of the patients had mild liver function abnormalities, and all of them were resolved without intervention. however, the remission time was similar between the two tested groups.conclusion: molnupiravir exhibited good viral replication inhibitor efficacy in patients with omicron variant vaccine breakthrough covid-19 infection.clinical trial registration: [https://www.chictr.org.cn/], identifier [chictr2200059796].",AB_0302
