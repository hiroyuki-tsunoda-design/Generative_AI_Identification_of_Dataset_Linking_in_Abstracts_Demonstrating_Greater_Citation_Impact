"numerous contour-based corner detection (cbcd) algorithms have been proposed recently, necessitating effective and practical evaluation. most existing methods evaluate corner detection accuracy through metrics between the testing image and its attacked versions or rely on image-specific ground truth for corner evaluation. these methods use images as input, failing to solely evaluate the corner detection performance but combining it with contour extraction evaluation. since contour extraction is another important research topic and existing cbcd algorithms almost have no contribution to contour extraction, this intertwining may negatively impact the evaluation results, hindering corner detection development. furthermore, most evaluation methods directly provide simple statistical scores of evaluation metrics, such as the mean value, which are inadequate to reflect the overall performance distribution. this study presents a novel benchmark that is specifically designed for assessing cbcd methods, which includes two major contributions. firstly, we design two dedicated datasets, one with the ground-truth corner and the other without them. the dedicated contours instead of images are employed as input to evaluate numerous cbcd methods, eliminating the impact of the extracted contour quality. when the ground-truth corners are unavailable, we employ additional contour attacks, including gaussian noise, projective, and combined geometry on contours, to simulate real-world complex image processes compared with the attacks in existing evaluation methods. secondly, we evaluate the performance of twelve cbcd methods using six distinct metrics based on the constructed contour datasets. to gain a deep insight into the overall performance distribution, the sign test method for hypothesis testing is utilized alongside some simple statistical measures for evaluation metric analysis. experimental results demonstrated that no individual method performs the best across all six evaluation metrics, while different cbcd algorithms have their positive scenarios. the evaluation code will be publicly available at https://github.com/roylin1229/cbcd_eva.& copy; 2023 published by elsevier b.v.",AB_0166
"cross-spectrum depth estimation aims to provide a reliable depth map under variant-illumination conditions with a pair of dual-spectrum images. it is valuable for autonomous driving applications when vehicles are equipped with two cameras of different modalities. however, images captured by different-modality cameras can be photometrically quite different, which makes cross-spectrum depth estimation a very challenging problem. moreover, the shortage of large-scale open-source datasets also retards further research in this field. in this paper, we propose an unsupervised visible light(vis)-image-guided cross-spectrum (i.e., thermal and visible-light, tir-vis in short) depth-estimation framework. the input of the framework consists of a cross-spectrum stereo pair (one vis image and one thermal image). first, we train a depth-estimation base network using vis-image stereo pairs. to adapt the trained depth-estimation network to the cross-spectrum images, we propose a multi-scale feature-transfer network to transfer features from the tir domain to the vis domain at the feature level. furthermore, we introduce a mechanism of cross-spectrum depth cycle-consistency to improve the depth estimation result of dual-spectrum image pairs. meanwhile, we release to society a large cross-spectrum dataset with visible-light and thermal stereo images captured in different scenes. the experiment result shows that our method achieves better depth-estimation results than the compared existing methods. our code and dataset are available on https://github.com/whitecrow1027/crosssp_depth.",AB_0166
"skin lesion segmentation is a computer-aided diagnosis method for quantitative analysis of melanoma that can improve efficiency and accuracy. although many methods based on u-net have achieved tremendous success, they still cannot handle challenging tasks well due to weak feature extraction. in response to skin lesion segmentation, a novel method called eiu-net is proposed to tackle the challenging task. to capture the local and global contextual information, we employ inverted residual blocks and an efficient pyramid squeeze attention (epsa) block as the main encoders at different stages, while atrous spatial pyramid pooling (aspp) is utilized after the last encoder and the soft-pool method is introduced for downsampling. also, we propose a novel method named multi-layer fusion (mlf) module to effectively fuse the feature distributions and capture significant boundary information of skin lesions in different encoders to improve the performance of the network. furthermore, a reshaped decoders fusion module is used to obtain multi-scale information by fusing feature maps of different decoders to improve the final results of skin lesion segmentation. to validate the performance of our proposed network, we compare it with other methods on four public datasets, including the isic 2016, isic 2017, isic 2018, and ph2 datasets. and the main metric dice scores achieved by our proposed eiu-net are 0.919, 0.855, 0.902, and 0.916 on the four datasets, respectively, outperforming other methods. ablation experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of the main modules in our proposed network. our code is available at https://github.com/awebnoob/eiu-net.",AB_0166
"the western mongolian lake zone was a neoproterozoic to early paleozoic volcanic arc where tuffs, lavas, fossiliferous siliciclastics, and carbonates accumulated during the early cambrian. an uppermost cambrian series 2 (upper stage 4) trilobite assemblage is described here from the burgasutay formation representing a continuous lower cambrian succession at the seer ridge of the great lake depression. the new assemblage is dominated by dorypygids and consists of 13 trilobite genera belonging to nine families including catinouyia heyunensis new species. these fossils comprise the youngest and richest lower cambrian trilobite assemblage in mongolia. the composition of the lake zone fauna suggests its biogeographic affinity with the siberian platform and altay-sayan foldbelt, but the presence of inouyiids also implies a connection of this region with east gondwana.uuid: http://zoobank.org/fb0ebe23-144f-46ed-9543-7df9eea85fbc",AB_0166

"protein phosphorylation, catalyzed by kinases, is an important biochemical process, which plays an essential role in multiple cell signaling pathways. meanwhile, protein-protein interactions (ppi) constitute the signaling pathways. abnormal phosphorylation status on protein can regulate protein functions through ppi to evoke severe diseases, such as cancer and alzheimer's disease. due to the limited experimental evidence and high costs to experimentally identify novel evidence of phosphorylation regulation on ppi, it is necessary to develop a high -accuracy and user-friendly artificial intelligence method to predict phosphorylation effect on ppi. here, we proposed a novel sequence-based machine learning method named phosppi, which achieved better identification performance (accuracy and auc) than other competing predictive methods of betts, hawkdock and foldx. phosppi is now freely available in web server (https://phosppi.sjtu.edu.cn/). this tool can help the user to identify functional phosphorylation sites affecting ppi and explore phosphorylation-associated disease mecha-nism and drug development.",AB_0166
"accurate identification and segmentation of moving ships to ensure maritime traffic safety has become an important task in maritime intelligent transportation system. with the development of artificial intelligence, maritime surveillance system based on computer vision has been widely studied. however, there are still some problems when applied to the actual maritime scene. for example, the degradation of visible image quality caused by rain, haze, and low illumination leads to a significant reduction in segmentation performance. to improve the performance of ship identification and segmentation under adverse weather conditions, we propose swinseg, a hybrid network combining swin transformer and lightweight multi-layer perceptron (mlp). to address the lack of suitable open-source datasets in the community, we have collected and labeled a semantic segmentation dataset of marine ships, named seashipsseg. it consists of 1200 visible marine ship images and covers six common ship types (bulk cargo carrier, container ship, fishing boat, general cargo ship, ore carrier, and passenger ship). in addition, synthetic degraded images are added to the dataset to increase its diversity and improve the generalization ability of the network. the experimental results show that the performance of our method is significantly better than the state-of-the-art (sota) methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, robustness, and efficiency under different weather conditions. the dataset is available at https://github.com/grimreaperz-creator/seashipsseg.",AB_0166
