"background the development of the brain requires precise coordination of molecular processes across many cell-types. underpinning these events are gene expression programs which require intricate regulation by non coding regulatory sequences known as enhancers. in the context of the developing brain, transcribed enhancers (tes) regulate temporally-specific expression of genes critical for cell identity and differentiation. transcription of non-coding rnas at active enhancer sequences, known as enhancer rnas (ernas), is tightly associated with enhancer activity and has been correlated with target gene expression. tes have been characterized in a multitude of developing tissues, however their regulatory role has yet to be described in the context of embryonic and early postnatal brain development. in this study, erna transcription was analyzed to identify tes active during cerebellar development, as a proxy for the developing brain. cap analysis of gene expression followed by sequencing (cageseq) was conducted at 12 stages throughout embryonic and early postnatal cerebellar development.results temporal analysis of erna transcription identified clusters of tes that peak in activity during either embryonic or postnatal times, highlighting their importance for temporally specific developmental events. functional analysis of putative target genes identified molecular mechanisms under te regulation revealing that tes regulate genes involved in biological processes specific to neurons. we validate enhancer activity using in situ hybridization of erna expression from tes predicted to regulate nfib, a gene critical for cerebellar granule cell differentiation.conclusions the results of this analysis provide a valuable dataset for the identification of cerebellar enhancers and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms critical for brain development under te regulation. this dataset is shared with the community through an online resource (https://goldowitzlab.shinyapps.io/trans-enh-app/).",AB_0098
"current object detectors typically have a feature pyramid (fp) module for multi-level feature fusion (mff) which aims to mitigate the gap between features from different levels and form a comprehensive object representation to achieve better detection performance. however, they usually require heavy cross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better mff result, making them complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. to address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that can help existing fps deliver better mff results while reducing the computational costs effectively. in particular, we introduce a novel insight that comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of representations for higher efficiency. the two representations include a locally concentrated representation and a globally summarized representation, where the former focuses on extracting context cues from nearby areas while the latter extracts general contextual representations of the whole image scene as global context cues. by collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a transformer decoder to investigate the relations between them and each local feature from the fp and then refine the mff results accordingly. as a result, we obtain a simple and light-weight transformer-based context condensation (tcc) module, which can boost various fps and lower their computational costs simultaneously. extensive experimental results on the challenging ms coco dataset show that tcc is compatible to four representative fps and consistently improves their detection accuracy by up to 7.8% in terms of average precision and reduce their complexities by up to around 20% in terms of gflops, helping them achieve state-of-the-art performance more efficiently. code will be released at https://github.com/zhechen/tcc.",AB_0098
"ribonucleic acids (rnas) are involved in a multitude of crucial cellular functions by acting as a central conduit for information transfer. due to their essential and versatile functional roles in the cell, rnas have also been implicated in multiple disease conditions of therapeutic relevance including cancers, bacterial and viral infections and neurodegenerative disorders. recently, several approaches have emerged to tap into the potentially unexplored regions of the druggable genome, which refers to the genes and gene products that are focused during drug development. for example, considering rnas as viable alternative therapeutic targets for drug development can potentially expand the range of therapeutic targets. consequently, the availability of adequate binding affinity measurements for rna-small molecule interactions is essential to understand target selectivity and design more potent rna-targeting drug-like molecules. to facilitate this growing need, we have curated a database of experimentally validated rna-small molecule interactions, called rna-small molecule interaction miner (r-sim). each entry in r-sim provides comprehensive information on sequence, structure and classification of the rna target, various physicochemical properties of the small molecule, binding affinity value and corresponding experimental conditions, threedimensional structure (experimental or modelled) of the rna-small molecule complex, and the literature source for the data. it also provides a user-friendly web interface with several options for search, display, sorting, visualization, download and upload of the data. r-sim is freely available at: https://web.iitm.ac.in/ bioinfo2/r_sim/index.html. we envisage that r-sim has several potential applications in understanding and accelerating the development of novel rna-targeted small molecule therapeutics.& copy; 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0098
"dimensionality reduction is a hot topic in machine learning that can help researchers find key features from complex medical or biological data, which is crucial for biological sequence research, drug develop-ment, etc. however, when applied to specific datasets, different dimensionality reduction methods gener-ate different results, which produces instability and makes tuning the parameters a time-consuming task. exploring high quality features, genes, or attributes from complex data is an important task and challenge. to ensure the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of experiments, in this work, we developed a dimen-sionality reduction tool mrmd3.0 based on the ensemble strategy of link analysis. it is mainly divided into two steps: first, the ensemble method is used to integrate different feature ranking algorithms to calculate feature importance, and then the forward feature search strategy combined with cross-validation is used to explore the proper feature combination. compared with the previously developed version, mrmd3.0 has added more link-based ensemble algorithms, including pagerank, hits, leaderrank, and trus-trank. at the same time, more feature ranking algorithms have been added, and their effect and calcu-lation speed have been greatly improved. in addition, the newest version provides an interface used by each feature ranking method and five kinds of charts to help users analyze features. finally, we also pro -vide an online webserver to help researchers analyze the data. availability and implementation web-server: http://lab.malab.cn/soft/mrmdv3/home.html. github: https://github.com/heshida01/mrmd3.0.& copy; 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0098
"combining multiple binding profiles, such as transcription factors and histone modifications, is a crucial step in revealing the functions of complex biological systems. although a massive amount of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (chip-seq) data is available, existing chip-seq databases or repositories focus on individual experiments, and it is difficult to elucidate orchestrated regulation by dna-binding elements. we developed the comprehensive collection and comparison for chip-seq database (c4s db) to provide researchers with insights into the combination of dna binding elements based on quality-assessed public chip-seq data. the c4s db is based on > 16,000 human chip-seq experiments and provides two main web interfaces to discover the relationships between chip-seq data. gene browser illustrates the landscape of distributions of binding elements around a specified gene, and global similarity, a hierarchical clustering heatmap based on a similarity between two chip-seq experiments, gives an overview of genome-wide relations of regulatory elements. these functions promote the identification or evaluation of both gene-specific and genome-wide colocalization or mutually exclusive localization. modern web technologies allow users to search for and aggregate large-scale experimental data through interactive web interfaces with quick responses. the c4s db is available at https://c4s.site.

"the genome of mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a relatively high percentage (10%) of genes that are poorly characterised because of their highly repetitive nature and high gc content. some of these genes encode proteins of the pe/ppe family, which are thought to be involved in host-pathogen interactions, virulence, and disease pathogenicity. members of this family are genetically divergent and challenging to both identify and classify using conventional computational tools. thus, advanced in silico methods are needed to identify proteins of this family for subsequent functional annotation efficiently. in this study, we developed the first deep learning-based approach, termed digerati, for the rapid and accurate identification of pe and ppe family proteins. digerati was built upon a multipath parallel hybrid deep learning framework, which equips multi-layer convolutional neural networks with bidirectional, long short-term memory, equipped with a self-attention module to effectively learn the higher-order feature representations of pe/ppe proteins. empirical studies demonstrated that digerati ach-ieved a significantly better performance (-18-20%) than alignment-based approaches, including blastp, phmmer, and hhsuite, in both prediction accuracy and speed. digerati is anticipated to facilitate community -wide efforts to conduct high-throughput identification and analysis of pe/ppe family members. the webserver and source codes of digerati are publicly available at http://web.unimelb-bioinfortools.cloud.edu.au/digerati/.",AB_0098
"background weight changes after gastrectomy affect not only quality of life but also prognosis and survival. however, it remains challenging to predict the weight changes of individual patients. using clinicopathological variables, we built a user-friendly tool to predict weight change after curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer. methods the clinical data of 984 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify variables predictive of postoperative weight change. a nomogram was developed and verified via bootstrap resampling. results age, sex, performance status, body mass index, extent of resection, pathological stage, and postoperative weight change significantly influenced postoperative weight recovery. postoperative levels of hemoglobin, albumin, ferritin and total iron-binding capacity were significant covariates. the nomogram performed well (concordance index = 0.637); calibration curves indicated appropriate levels of agreement. we developed an online weight prediction calculator based on the nomogram (http://gc-.weightchange.com/en/front/). conclusions the novel, web-calculator based on the predictive model allows surgeons to explore patient weight patterns quickly. the model identifies patients at high risk for weight loss after gastrectomy; such patients require multidisciplinary medical support.",AB_0098
"seeds are a vital source of calories for humans and a unique stage in the life cycle of flowering plants. during seed germination, the embryo undergoes major developmental transitions to become a seedling. studying gene expression in individual seed cell types has been challenging due to the lack of spatial information or low throughput of existing methods. to overcome these limitations, a spatial transcriptomics workflow was developed for germinating barley grain. this approach enabled high-throughput analysis of spatial gene expression, revealing specific spatial expression patterns of various functional gene categories at a sub-tissue level. this study revealed over 14 000 genes differentially regulated during the first 24 h after imbibition. individual genes, such as the aquaporin gene family, starch degradation, cell wall modification, transport processes, ribosomal proteins and transcription factors, were found to have specific spatial expression patterns over time. using spatial autocorrelation algorithms, we identified auxin transport genes that had increasingly focused expression within subdomains of the embryo over time, suggesting their role in establishing the embryo axis. overall, our study provides an unprecedented spatially resolved cellular map for barley germination and identifies specific functional genomics targets to better understand cellular restricted processes during germination. the data can be viewed at https://spatial.latrobe.edu.au/.",AB_0098
"background patients without human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are increasingly recognized as being at risk for cryptococcosis. knowledge of characteristics of cryptococcosis in these patients remains incomplete.methods we conducted a retrospective study of cryptococcosis in 46 australian and new zealand hospitals to compare its frequency in patients with and without hiv and describe its characteristics in patients without hiv. patients with cryptococcosis between january 2015 and december 2019 were included.results of 475 patients with cryptococcosis, 90% were without hiv (426 of 475) with marked predominance in both cryptococcus neoformans (88.7%) and cryptococcus gattii cases (94.3%). most patients without hiv (60.8%) had a known immunocompromising condition: cancer (n = 91), organ transplantation (n = 81), or other immunocompromising condition (n = 97). cryptococcosis presented as incidental imaging findings in 16.4% of patients (70 of 426). the serum cryptococcal antigen test was positive in 85.1% of tested patients (319 of 375); high titers independently predicted risk of central nervous system involvement. lumbar puncture was performed in 167 patients to screen for asymptomatic meningitis, with a positivity rate of 13.2% where meningitis could have been predicted by a high serum cryptococcal antigen titer and/or fungemia in 95% of evaluable cases. one-year all-cause mortality was 20.9% in patients without hiv and 21.7% in patients with hiv (p = .89).conclusions ninety percent of cryptococcosis cases occurred in patients without hiv (89% and 94% for c. neoformans and c. gattii, respectively). emerging patient risk groups were evident. a high level of awareness is warranted to diagnose cryptococcosis in patients without hiv. we report 475 cryptococcosis cases from australasia. patients without human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) comprised 90% of cases. of these, only 61% had known immunocompromise. cryptococcosis was an incidental finding in 16%. increased awareness of cryptococcosis is warranted in patients without hiv. graphical abstract this graphical abstract is also available at tidbit: https://tidbitapp.io/tidbits/currentepidemiology-and-clinical-features-of-cryptococcus-infection-in-patients-without-hiv-infection-a-multicentre-study-in-46-hospitalsfrom-australia-and-new-zealand",AB_0098
"code summarization attempts to summarize the semantics of source code by automatically producing brief natural-language descriptions. most existing work proposes to learn from the abstract syntax tree (ast) and plain text of source code for summary generation. however, little attention has been paid to the structural heterogeneity and layout features of source code. in this paper, we present a novel framework titled hetsum to address these issues. specifically, a heterogeneous syntax graph (hsg) is first built by designing six types of augmented edges in ast, which indicates the heterogeneous structure of source code. meanwhile, a dual position is designed for each token in the source code by considering the layout information. moreover, we develop a heterogeneous graph neural network in hetsum to encode the hsg while extracting the code layout features with the transformer encoder. by assimilating the learned code token vectors into the hsg encoder, hetsum can capture the relations between its two encoders for improved code representation. to facilitate the generation of high-quality summaries, we integrate a copying mechanism into the decoding procedure while expanding the transformer decoding sublayer. extensive experiments on the java and python datasets prove that hetsum is superior to seventeen state-of-the-art baselines. to promote reproducibility studies, we make the implementation of hetsum available at https://github.com/gjcexp/hetsum.",AB_0098
