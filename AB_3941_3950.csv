"introduction a double-lumen tube (dlt) is a traditional one-lung ventilation tool that needs to be positioned under the guidance of a fibreoptic bronchoscope or auscultation. the placement is complex, and poor positioning often causes hypoxaemia. in recent years, vivasight double-lumen tubes (v-dlts) have been widely used in thoracic surgery. because the tubes can be continuously observed during intubation and the operation, malposition can be corrected at any time. however, the effect of v-dlt on perioperative hypoxaemia has been rarely reported. the aim of this study was to observe the incidence of hypoxaemia during one-lung ventilation with v-dlt and to compare the perioperative complications between v-dlt and conventional double-lumen tube (c-dlt). methods and analysis one hundred patients planning to undergo thoracoscopic surgery will be randomised into the c-dlt group and the v-dlt group. during one-lung ventilation, both groups of patients will receive low tidal volume for volume control ventilation. when the blood oxygen saturation falls below 95%, the dlt will be repositioned and the oxygen concentration will be increased to improve the respiratory parameters (5 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure (peep) on the ventilation side and 5 cm h2o cpap (continuous airway positive pressure) on the operation side), and double lung ventilation measures will be taken in sequence to prevent a further decline in blood oxygen saturation. the primary outcomes are the incidence and duration of hypoxaemia and the number of intraoperative hypoxaemia treatments, and the secondary outcomes will be postoperative complications and total hospitalisation expenses. ethics and dissemination the study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital, sun yat-sen university (2020-418) and registered at the chinese clinical trial registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn). the results of the study will be analysed and reported.",AB_0395
"removing optical and atmospheric blur from galaxy images significantly improves galaxy shape measurements for weak gravitational lensing and galaxy evolution studies. this ill-posed linear inverse problem is usually solved with deconvolution algorithms enhanced by regularisation priors or deep learning. we introduce a so-called 'physics-informed deep learning' approach to the point spread function (psf) deconvolution problem in galaxy surveys. we apply algorithm unrolling and the plug-and-play technique to the alternating direction method of multipliers (admm), in which a neural network learns appropriate hyperparameters and denoising priors from simulated galaxy images. we characterize the time-performance trade-off of several methods for galaxies of differing brightness levels, as well as our method's robustness to systematic psf errors and network ablations. we show an improvement in reduced shear ellipticity error of 38.6 percent (snr=20)/45.0 percent (snr=200) compared to classic methods and 7.4 percent (snr=20)/33.2 percent (snr = 200) compared to modern methods (https://github.com/lukeli0425/galaxy-deconv).",AB_0395
"background: the mechanism of nafld progression remains incompletely understood. current gene-centric analysis methods lack reproducibility in transcriptomic studies. methods: a compendium of nafld tissue transcriptome datasets was analyzed. gene co-expression modules were identified in the rna-seq dataset gse135251. module genes were analyzed in the r gprofiler package for functional annotation. module stability was assessed by sampling. module reproducibility was analyzed by the module preservation function in the wgcna package. analysis of variance (anova) and student ' s t-test was used to identify differential modules. the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve was used to illustrate the classification performance of modules. connectivity map was used to mine potential drugs for nafld treatment. results: sixteen gene co-expression modules were identified in nafld. these modules were associated with multiple functions such as nucleus, translation, transcription factors, vesicle, immune response, mitochondrion, collagen, and sterol biosynthesis. these modules were stable and reproducible in the other 10 datasets. two modules were positively associated with steatosis and fibrosis and were differentially expressed between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) and non-alcoholic fatty liver (nafl). three modules can efficiently separate control and nafl. four modules can separate nafl and nash. two endoplasmic reticulum related modules were both upregulated in nafl and nash compared to normal control. proportions of fibroblasts and m1 macrophages are positively correlated with fibrosis. two hub genes aebp1 and fdft1 may play important roles in fibrosis and steatosis. m6a genes were strongly correlated with the expression of modules. eight candidate drugs for nafld treatment were proposed. finally, an easy-to-use nafld gene co-expression database was developed (available at https://nafld.shinyapps.io/ shiny/). conclusion: two gene modules show good performance in stratifying nafld patients. the modules and hub genes may provide targets for disease treatment.",AB_0395
"oscillatory processes at all spatial scales and on all frequencies underpin brain function. electrophysiological source imaging (esi) is the data-driven brain imaging modality that provides the inverse solutions to the source processes of the eeg, meg, or ecog data. this study aimed to carry out an esi of the source cross-spectrum while controlling common distortions of the estimates. as with all esi-related problems under realistic settings, the main obstacle we faced is a severely ill-conditioned and high-dimensional inverse problem. therefore, we opted for bayesian inverse solutions that posited a priori probabilities on the source process. indeed, rigorously specifying both the likelihoods and a priori probabilities of the problem leads to the proper bayesian inverse problem of cross-spectral matrices. these inverse solutions are our formal definition for cross-spectral esi (cesi), which requires a priori of the source cross-spectrum to counter the severe ill-condition and high-dimensionality of matrices. however, inverse solutions for this problem were np-hard to tackle or approximated within iterations with bad-conditioned matrices in the standard esi setup. we introduce cesi with a joint a priori probability upon the source cross-spectrum to avoid these problems. cesi inverse solutions are low-dimensional ones for the set of random vector instances and not random matrices. we achieved cesi inverse solutions through the variational approximations via our spectral structured sparse bayesian learning (sssbl) algorithmhttps://github.com/ccc-members/spectralstructured- sparse- bayesian-learning. we compared low-density eeg (10-20 system) sssbl inverse solutions with reference cesis for two experiments: (a) high-density meg that were used to simulate eeg and (b) high-density macaque ecog that were recorded simultaneously with eeg. the sssbl resulted in two orders of magnitude with less distortion than the state-of-the-art esi methods.our cesi toolbox, including the sssbl method, is available at https://github.com/ ccc- members/bc-vareta_toolbox.",AB_0395
"the heart is a relatively complex non-rigid motion organ in the human body. quantitative motion analysis of the heart takes on a critical significance to help doctors with accurate diagnosis and treatment. moreover, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (cmri) can be used to perform a more detailed quantitative analysis evaluation for cardiac diagnosis. deformable image registration (dir) has become a vital task in biomedical image analysis since tissue structures have variability in medical images. recently, the model based on masked autoencoder (mae) has recently been shown to be e ective in computer vision tasks. vision transformer has the context aggregation ability to restore the semantic information in the original image regions by using a low proportion of visible image patches to predict the masked image patches. a novel transformer-convnet architecture is proposed in this study based on mae for medical image registration. the core of the transformer is designed as a masked autoencoder (mae) and a lightweight decoder structure, and feature extraction before the downstream registration task is transformed into the self-supervised learning task. this study also rethinks the calculation method of the multihead self-attention mechanism in the transformer encoder. we improve the query-key-value-based dot product attention by introducing both depthwise separable convolution (dwsc) and squeeze and excitation (se) modules into the self-attention module to reduce the amount of parameter computation to highlight image details and maintain high spatial resolution image features. in addition, concurrent spatial and channel squeeze and excitation (scse) module is embedded into the cnn structure, which also proves to be e ective for extracting robust feature representations. the proposed method, called mae-transrnet, has better generalization. the proposed model is evaluated on the cardiac short-axis public dataset (with images and labels) at the 2017 automated cardiac diagnosis challenge (acdc). the relevant qualitative and quantitative results (e.g., dice performance and hausdor distance) suggest that the proposed model can achieve superior results over those achieved by the state-of-the-artmethods, thus proving thatmae and improved self-attention aremore e ective and promising for medical image registration tasks. codes andmodels are available at https://github. com/xinxiao101/mae-transrnet.",AB_0395
