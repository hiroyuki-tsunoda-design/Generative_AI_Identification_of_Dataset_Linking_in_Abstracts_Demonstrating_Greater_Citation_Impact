"various unsupervised anomaly detection methods using deep learning have recently been proposed, and the accuracy of the anomaly detection technique for local anomalies has been improved. however, no anomaly detection dataset includes co-occurrence-related anomalies, which are combination-related. thus, the accuracy of anomaly detection for co-occurrence-related anomalies has not progressed. therefore, we propose sa-patchcore, which introduces self-attention to the state-of-the-art local anomaly detection model, patchcore. it detects anomalies in co-occurrence relationships and anomalies in local areas with the benefit of the self-attention module, which can consider contexts between separated words introduced first in the natural language processing field. as no anomaly detection dataset includes anomalies in co-occurrence relation, we prepared a new dataset called the co-occurrence anomaly detection screw dataset (cad-sd). furthermore, we performed experiments on anomaly detection using the new dataset. sa-patchcore achieves high anomaly detection performance compared with patchcore in the cad-sd. moreover, our proposed model shows almost the same anomaly detection performance as patchcore in an mvtec anomaly detection dataset, which is composed of anomalies in a local area. as a contribution to the anomaly detection task, we have released the cad-sd to the public. the code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/ishidakengo/sa-patchcore",AB_0126
"robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (rmis) has been shown to be effective in improving surgeon capabilities, providing magnified 3d vision, highly dexterous surgical tools, and intuitive human-robot interfaces for high-precision tool motion control. robotic surgical tools (rst) are a critical component that defines the performance of an rmis system. current rsts still represent a high cost, with few commercially available options, which limits general access and research on rmis. we aim to take advantage of recent progress in biocompatible 3d printing and contribute to the development of rmis technologies, presenting an open platform for low-cost, biocompatible, and customizable rsts. the proposed design concept consists of a 3-dof end-effector with a decoupled wrist mechanism, a tool interface module, and a tool drive unit. we validated our end-effector design using finite element analysis (fea) to confirm that stress generated by high grip forces is maintained below the material yield stress. validation experiments showed that the proposed rst could provide up to 10n grip forces and up to 3n pulling forces. the proposed control framework exhibited a mean absolute positioning tracking error of approximately 0.1 rad. finally, we also demonstrated the use of the proposed rst in two surgical training tasks: pick-and-place and stitching. the designs and software control framework are open-access and freely available for customization and fast development at https://github.com/jcolan/openrst.",AB_0126
"as a new attempt to design a precise mathematical model for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (pemfc), in this paper, three recently-proposed well-established optimizers: horse herding optimization algorithm (hoa), seagull optimization algorithm (soa) and gradient-based optimizer (gbo) integrated with two newly-proposed effective strategies, namely self-adaptive strategy, and ranking-based updating strategy, have been extensively investigated to accurately estimate the unknown parameters of this model for accomplishing a better output voltage of the simulated pemfc stacks. those hybridized algorithms were briefly named hhoa, hsoa, and hgbo. to assess the performance of those proposed algorithms, six common pemfc stacks were used and their outcomes were extensively compared with the standard algorithms and some of the state-of-the-arts under various performance metrics and the wilcoxon rank-sum test. the experimental findings show the effectiveness of both hgbo and hsoa in terms of convergence speed and final accuracy; however, hsoa could be more stable. the source code of this study is publicly available at https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/d9263036-9f80-4a40-bad9-ad476ed19c69.",AB_0126
"the joint use of multisource remote-sensing (rs) data for earth observation missions has drawn much attention. although the fusion of several data sources can improve the accuracy of land-cover identification, many technical obstacles, such as disparate data structures, irrelevant physical characteristics, and a lack of training data, exist. in this article, a novel dual-branch method, consisting of a hierarchical convolutional neural network (cnn) and a transformer network, is proposed for fusing multisource heterogeneous information and improving joint classification performance. first, by combining the cnn with a transformer, the proposed dual-branch network can significantly capture and learn spectral-spatial features from hyperspectral image (hsi) data and elevation features from light detection and ranging (lidar) data. then, to fuse these two sets of data features, a cross-token attention (cta) fusion encoder is designed in a specialty. the well-designed deep hierarchical architecture takes full advantage of the powerful spatial context information extraction ability of the cnn and the strong long-range dependency modeling ability of the transformer network based on the self-attention (sa) mechanism. four standard datasets are used in experiments to verify the effectiveness of the approach. the experimental results reveal that the proposed framework can perform noticeably better than state-of-the-art methods. the source code of the proposed method will be available publicly at https://github.com/zgr6010/fusion_hct.git.",AB_0126
"background: physician burnout is a common problem, with onset frequently occurring during undergraduate education. early intervention strategies that train medical students in psychological flexibility skills could support well-being and mitigate burnout risks associated with unmodifiable career stressors. there is a need for randomized controlled trials to assess effectiveness. as psychological flexibility varies contextually and among individuals, tailoring interventions may improve outcomes. smartphone apps can facilitate individualization and accessibility, and the evaluation of this approach is an identified research priority.objective: this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a stand-alone app-delivered acceptance and commitment training intervention for improving medical students' self-reported burnout, well-being, psychological flexibility, and psychological distress outcomes. we aimed to explore whether an individualized app would demonstrate benefits over a nonindividualized version.methods: this parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted with a sample of medical students from 2 australian universities (n=143). participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 intervention arms (individualized, nonindividualized, and waitlist) using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. individualized and nonindividualized participants were blinded to group allocation. the 5-week intervention included an introductory module (stage 1) and on-demand access to short skill training activities (stage 2), which students accessed at their own pace. stage 2 was either nonindividualized or individualized to meet students' identified psychological flexibility training needs. results: the mean differences in change from baseline between the intervention groups and the waitlist group were not statistically significant for burnout outcomes: exhaustion (primary; individualized: -0.52, 95% ci -3.70 to 2.65, p=.75; nonindividualized: 1.60, 95% ci -1.84 to 5.03, p=.37), cynicism (individualized: -1.26, 95% ci -4.46 to 1.94, p=.44; nonindividualized: 1.00, 95% ci -2.45 to 4.46, p=.57), and academic efficacy (individualized: 0.94, 95% ci -0.90 to 2.79, p=.32; nonindividualized: 2.02, 95% ci 0.02-4.03, p=.05). following the intervention, the individualized group demonstrated improved psychological flexibility (0.50, 95% ci 0.12-0.89; p=.01), reduced inflexibility (0.48, 95% ci -0.92 to -0.04; p=.04), and reduced stress (-6.89, 95% ci -12.01 to 5.99; p=.01), and the nonindividualized group demonstrated improved well-being (6.46, 95% ci 0.49-12.42; p=.04) and stress (-6.36, 95% ci -11.90 to -0.83; p=.03) compared with waitlist participants. between-group differences for the individualized and nonindividualized arms were not statistically significant. high attrition (75/143, 52.4%) was observed. conclusions: this trial provides early support for the potential benefits of acceptance and commitment training for medical student well-being and psychological outcomes and demonstrates that psychological flexibility and inflexibility can be trained using a smartphone app. although postintervention burnout outcomes were not statistically significant, improvements in secondary outcomes could indicate early risk mitigation. replication studies with larger samples and longer-term follow-up are required, and future research should focus on improving implementation frameworks to increase engagement and optimize individualization methods. trial registration: australian new zealand clinical trials registry 12621000911897; https://tinyurl.com/2p92cwrw",AB_0126
"unsupervised domain adaptive (uda) object re-identification (re-id) aims at adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. state-of-the-art object re-id approaches adopt clustering algorithms to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled target domain. however, the inevitable label noise caused by the clustering procedure significantly degrades the discriminative power of re-id model. to address this problem, we propose an uncertainty-aware clustering framework (ucf) for uda tasks. first, a novel hierarchical clustering scheme is proposed to promote clustering quality. second, an uncertainty-aware collaborative instance selection method is introduced to select images with reliable labels for model training. combining both techniques effectively reduces the impact of noisy labels. in addition, we introduce a strong baseline that features a compact contrastive loss. our ucf method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple uda tasks for object re-id, and significantly reduces the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised re-id. in particular, the performance of our unsupervised ucf method in the msmt17$\to$market1501 task is better than that of the fully supervised setting on market1501. the code of ucf is available at https://github.com/wang-pengfei/ucf.",AB_0126
"low-rank tensor representation philosophy has enjoyed a reputation in many hyperspectral image (hsi) low-level vision applications, but previous studies often failed to comprehensively exploit the low-rank nature of hsi along different modes in low-dimensional subspace, and unsurprisingly handled only one specific task. to address these challenges, in this paper, we figured out that in addition to the spatial correlation, the spectral dependency of hsi also implicitly exists in the coefficient tensor of its subspace, this crucial dependency that was not fully utilized by previous studies yet can be effectively exploited in a cascaded manner. this led us to propose a unified subspace low-rank learning regime with a new tensor cascaded rank minimization, named stcr, to fully couple the low-rankness of hsi in different domains for various low-level vision tasks. technically, the high-dimensional hsi was first projected into a low-dimensional tensor subspace, then a novel tensor low-cascaded-rank decomposition was designed to collapse the constructed tensor into three core tensors in succession to more thoroughly exploit the correlations in spatial, nonlocal, and spectral modes of the coefficient tensor. next, difference continuity-regularization was introduced to learn a basis that more closely approximates the hsi's endmembers. the proposed regime realizes a comprehensive delineation of the self-portrait of hsi tensor. extensive evaluations conducted with dozens of state-of-the-art (sota) baselines on eight datasets verified that the proposed regime is highly effective and robust to typical hsi low-level vision tasks, including denoising, compressive sensing reconstruction, inpainting, and destriping. the source code of our method is released at https://github.com/cx-he/stcr.git.",AB_0126
"background: men who have sex with men (msm) who practice chemsex have a higher likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behaviors and higher rates of hiv infection and other sexually transmitted infections (stis) than those who do not.objective: this trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based intervention in reducing the sexual harms of chemsex among msm.methods: the study was a 2-arm, assessor-blinded, randomized, parallel-group trial with a 3-month follow-up period. the study was conducted in the year 2021 in hong kong. underpinned by the theory of planned behaviors and a harm reduction approach, the intervention consisted of interactive components and knowledge-based information about chemsex. participants in the control group received brief information and content about sexual violence. the primary outcome was self-efficacy in refusing risky sexual behaviors and chemsex, as measured by the condom self-efficacy scale (cses), self-efficacy for sexual safety (sess) instrument, and drug avoidance self-efficacy scale (dases). the secondary outcomes included intentions to have chemsex, actual engagement in chemsex, hiv and other sti testing, and condom use in the last 3 months. all outcomes were self-reported. an online structured questionnaire was used to collect data.results: in total, 316 msm enrolled in the study. the intervention group demonstrated a significantly larger improvement in condom-use self-efficacy (as measured by cses scores; time-by-group interaction: 0=4.52, 95% ci 2.03-7.02; p<.001), self-efficacy for sexual safety (as measured by sess scores; time-by-group interaction: 0=2.11, 95% ci 0.66-3.56; p=.004), and drug avoidance self-efficacy (as measured by dases scores; time-by-group interaction: 0=6.98, 95% ci 1.75-12.22; p=.009). regarding the secondary outcomes, participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly larger reduction in the likelihood of having engaged in chemsex in the last 3 months (time-by-group interaction: odds ratio [or]=0.23, 95% ci 0.10-0.53; p=.001) and likelihood of having had the intention to engage in chemsex in the last 3 months (time-by-group interaction: or=0.37, 95% ci 0.18-0.78; p=.009). participants in the intervention group also showed a significantly larger increase in the likelihood of having undergone hiv testing in the last 3 months (time-by-group interaction: or=3.08, 95% ci 1.72-5.54; p<.001). conclusions: this study suggests that a web-based intervention with a harm reduction approach can enhance the self-efficacy of msm in refusing risky sexual behaviors and chemsex and improve the uptake of hiv testing. we also provide initial evidence that such interventions can reduce both the intention of msm to engage in chemsex and their actual engagement in chemsex.trial registration: isrctn registry isrctn20134522; https://www.isrctn.com/isrctn20134522.",AB_0126
"study objectives: recent findings indicate that noradrenergic and muscarinic processes are crucial for pharyngeal muscle control during sleep. however, to date, reductions in obstructive sleep apnea (osa) severity have only been detected when noradrenergic agents are combined with an antimuscarinic. accordingly, this study aimed to determine if reboxetine alone and combined with oxybutynin reduces osa severity. the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning the effects of these agents were also investigated via endotyping analysis.methods: sixteen people (6 women) with osa completed 3 polysomnograms (-1-week washout) according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design across 2 sites. single doses of 4 mg reboxetine, placebo, or 4 mg reboxetine + 5 mg oxybutynin were administered before sleep (order randomized).results: reboxetine reduced the apnea-hypopnea index (primary outcome) by 5.4 (95% confidence interval -10.4 to -0.3) events/h, p = .03 (-24 & plusmn; 27% in men; -0.7 & plusmn; 32% in women). oxybutynin did not cause additional reductions in apnea-hypopnea index. reboxetine alone reduced the 4% oxygen desaturation index by (mean & plusmn; standard deviation) 5.2 & plusmn; 7.2 events/h and reboxetine+oxybutynin by 5.1 & plusmn; 10.6 events/h vs placebo, p = .02. nadir oxygen saturation also increased by 7 & plusmn; 11% with reboxetine and 5 & plusmn; 9% with reboxetine+oxybutynin vs placebo, p = .01. mechanistically, reboxetine and reboxetine+oxybutynin improved pharyngeal collapsibility and respiratory control (loop gain). larger reductions in apnea-hypopnea index with reboxetine in men were associated with higher baseline loop gain.conclusions: these findings show the first evidence that reboxetine alone reduces osa severity. the data provide novel insight into the role of norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors on upper airway stability during sleep and are important to inform future pharmacotherapy development for osa.clinical trial registration: registry: australian new zealand clinical trials registry; name: reboxetine and combination therapy with ad128 in sleep apnoea trial: a double-blind, 3-way cross-over study; url: https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=374614 & isreview=true; identifier: actrn12620000662965.",AB_0126
"motion cue is pivotal inmoving object analysis, which is the root formotion segmentation and detection. these preprocessing tasks are building blocks for several applications such as recognition, matching and estimation. to devise a robust algorithm for motion analysis, it is imperative to have a comprehensive dataset to evaluate an algorithm's performance. the main limitation in making these kind of datasets is the creation of ground-truth annotation of motion, as each moving object might span over multiple frames with changes in size, illumination and angle of view. besides the optical changes, the object can undergo occlusion by static or moving occluders. the challenge increases when the video is captured by a moving camera. in this paper, we tackle the task of providing ground-truth annotation on motion regions in videos captured from a moving camera. with minimal manual annotation of an object mask, we are able to propagate the label mask in all the frames. object label correction based on static and moving occluder is also performed by applying occluder mask tracking for a given depth ordering. a motion annotation dataset is also proposed to evaluate algorithm performance. the results show that our cascaded-naive approach provides successful results. all the resources of the annotation tool are publicly available at http://dixie.udg.edu/anntool/.",AB_0126
