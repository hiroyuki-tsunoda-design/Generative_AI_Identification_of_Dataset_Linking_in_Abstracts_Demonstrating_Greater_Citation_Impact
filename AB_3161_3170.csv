"identifying the exact epitope positions for a monoclonal antibody (mab) is of critical importance yet highly challenging to the ab design of biomedical research. based on previous versions of seppa 3.0, we present seppa-mab for the above purpose with high accuracy and low false positive rate (fpr), suitable for both experimental and modelled structures. in practice, seppa-mab appended a fingerprints-based patch model to seppa 3.0, considering the structural and physic-chemical complementarity between a possible epitope patch and the complementarity-determining region of mab and trained on 860 representative antigen-antibody complexes. on independent testing of 193 antigen-antibody pairs, seppa-mab achieved an accuracy of 0.873 with an fpr of 0.097 in classifying epitope and non-epitope residues under the default threshold, while docking-based methods gave the best auc of 0.691, and the top epitope prediction tool gave auc of 0.730 with balanced accuracy of 0.635. a study on 36 independent hiv glycoproteins displayed a high accuracy of 0.918 and a low fpr of 0.058. further testing illustrated outstanding robustness on new antigens and modelled antibodies. being the first online tool predicting mab-specific epitopes, seppa-mab may help to discover newepitopes and design better mabs for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. seppa-mab can be accessed at http://www.badd-cao.net/seppa-mab/.",AB_0317
"three-dimensional (3d) object detection utilizes numerous onboard sensors to determine the position, size, and motion information of surrounding objects. recently, some researchers have utilized hd maps in 3d object detection for lidar point clouds. however, existing lidar-map fusion detection methods simply take the hd map as an additional input and more prior information in the map is underexplored. to address this limitation, we employ the hd map in data augmentation for lidar 3d detection to eliminate the bias of distributions between the augmented training and test sets. furthermore, we propose a map-enhanced 3d object detection network, called menet, for lidar point clouds. compared with the standard lidar-only detector in bird's eye view (bev), menet extends lidar-based baselines by using a map encoder to encode the input rasterized hd map into a bev feature. in addition, it uses a multimodal fuser to aggregate the map bev feature with the lidar bev feature extracted in the lidar stream. menet achieved a mean average precision (map) of 56.90% and nuscenes detection score (nds) of 63.43%, improving the map and nds of its lidar-only backbone by 4.18% and 2.22%, respectively. although the hd map is necessary at training time, the map-enhanced 3d detector can work robustly and perform better than the original baseline when there was no map input at test time. experimental results further indicate that the proposed map plugins can improve the performance of both anchor-based and anchor-free models on different datasets. the code will be open-source at https://github.com/whu-usi3dv/menet.",AB_0317
"feature selection, widely used in data preprocessing, is a challenging problem as it involves hard combinatorial optimization. so far some meta-heuristic algorithms have shown effectiveness in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. as the arithmetic optimization algorithm only performs well in dealing with continuous optimization problems, multiple binary arithmetic optimization algorithms (baoas) utilizing different strategies are proposed to perform feature selection. first, six algorithms are formed based on six different transfer functions by converting the continuous search space to the discrete search space. second, in order to enhance the speed of searching and the ability of escaping from the local optima, six other algorithms are further developed by integrating the transfer functions and le'vy flight. based on 20 common university of california irvine (uci) datasets, the performance of our proposed algorithms in feature selection is evaluated, and the results demonstrate that baoa_s1lf is the most superior among all the proposed algorithms. moreover, the performance of baoa_s1lf is compared with other meta-heuristic algorithms on 26 uci datasets, and the corresponding results show the superiority of baoa_s1lf in feature selection. source codes of baoa_s1lf are publicly available at: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/124545-binary-arith metic-optimization-algorithm",AB_0317
"super-enhancers (ses) play an essential regulatory role in various biological processes and diseases through their specific interaction with transcription factors (tfs). here, we present the release of seanal-ysis 2.0 (http://licpathway.net/seanalysis), an up-dated version of the seanalysis web server for the comprehensive analyses of transcriptional regula-tory networks formed by ses, pathways, tfs, and genes. the current version added mouse ses and further expanded the scale of human ses, docu-menting 1 167 518 human ses from 1739 samples and 550 226 mouse ses from 931 samples. the se-related samples in seanalysis 2.0 were more than five times that in version 1.0, which significantly im-proved the ability of original se-related network anal-yses (pathway downstream analysis', upstream reg-ulatory analysis' and genomic region annotation') for understanding context-specific gene regulation. furthermore, we designed two novel analysis mod-els, tf regulatory analysis' and sample compara-tive analysis' for supporting more comprehensive analyses of se regulatory networks driven by tfs. further, the risk snps were annotated to the se re-gions to provide potential se-related disease/trait in-formation. hence, we believe that seanalysis 2.0 has significantly expanded the data and analytical capa-bilities of ses, which helps researchers in an in-depth understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ses.

"the rapid emergence of sars-cov-2 variants with multi-sites mutations is considered as a major obstacle for the development of drugs and vaccines. although most of the functional proteins essential for sars-cov-2 have been determined, the understanding of the covid-19 target-ligand interactions remains a key challenge. the old version of this covid-19 docking server was built in 2020, and free and open to all users. here, we present ncovdock2, a new docking server to predict the binding modes for targets from sars-cov-2. first, the new server supports more targets. we replaced the modeled structures with newly resolved structures and added more potential targets of covid-19, especially for the variants. second, for small molecule docking, autodock vina was upgraded to the latest version 1.2.0, and a new scoring function was added for peptide or antibody docking. third, the input interface and molecular visualization were updated for a better user experience. the web server, together with an extensive help and tutorial, are freely available at: https://ncovdock2.schanglab.org.cn.",AB_0317
"due to its importance regarding the integration, economic dispatch, and operation of pv smart grid systems, infrastructure planning, and budgeting, the accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (pv) power generation has drawn increasing research and industry attention. however, the instability, intermittence, and randomness of solar irradiance impose difficulties on the short-term economic dispatch of a smart integrated power, grid and significantly increase the risks arising from pv generation in a power system, exposing pv generators to potential additional costs. a deep convolutional neural network (cnn)-based method can effectively improve the performance of pv generation point prediction and probabilistic interval prediction by efficiently extracting nonlinear features at each frequency. nevertheless, existing deep learning (dl) studies have mostly focused on more complex network topologies and data decomposition algorithms, ignoring the importance of simultaneously forecasting the pv power produced over multiple temporal periods. to solve the described challenge, we propose a novel two-stage dl approach for pv generation prediction. the end-to-end trained model used in the proposed pv generation forecasting method is an effort to combine the existing methods and avoid the separation of entire task, such as single time-scale pv generation forecasting, independent point forecasting, and probabilistic interval forecasting. a temporal signal decomposition technique called variational mode decomposition (vmd) is employed in the first stage to construct association mappings from fine-grained features to images. in the second stage, an innovative capsule cnn (accnet) is proposed to obtain very short-term multihorizon ahead output power predictions for seven different pv systems based on polycrystalline, monocrystalline, cadmium telluride (cdte) thin-film, amorphous, copper indium gallium diselenide (cigs) thin-film, heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (hit) hybrid, and concentrated photovoltaic (cpv) technologies. the input parameters for each system include solar radiation (diffuse/global horizontal radiation (dhr/ghr) and radiation diffuse/global tilted (rdt/rgt)) and ambient temperature, while the output parameter is the power output of each pv system. the proposed model is validated with the historical datasets of a pv system downloaded from the desert knowledge precinct in central australia (dkasc) homepage. the performance of the developed method is proven in detail based on seven different pv systems over multiple data periods, and the experimental results reveal that the proposed approach displays significant improvements and robustness in point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting tasks. we will release the source code to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future work. our model is open-sourced at https://github.com/yunduanfei/accnet.",AB_0317
"click-through rate (ctr) prediction is a critical task in recommender systems and online advertising systems. the extensive collection of behavior data has become popular for building prediction models by capturing user interests from behavior sequences. there are two types of entities involved in behavior sequences, users and items, which form three kinds of relationships: user-to-user, user-to-item, and item-to-item. most related work focuses on only one or two of these relationships, often ignoring the association between users, which also helps discover potential user interests. in this paper, we consider all three relationships useful and propose a multi-dimensional interest network (min) to focus on their impact on ctr prediction simultaneously. it consists of three sub-networks that capture users' preferences regarding group interests and individual interests. specifically, the u-u sub-network models the relationship between the target user and those who have clicked on the target item. it takes user representations learned from behavior sequences via transformer as input. two other sub-networks capture the individual interest of the target user. the u-i sub-network models the relationship between the target user and the target item. the i-i sub-network models the relationship between the target item and the items the target user has interacted with in the past time. extensive evaluations on the real datasets show that our min model outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in prediction accuracy (+ 5.0% in auc and - 17.2% in logloss, averagely). the ablation experiments also validate that each sub-network in min helps with improving the ctr prediction performance by using the u-u sub-network playing a more critical role. the source code is available at https://github.com/cocolixiao/min.",AB_0317
"ribonucleic acids (rnas) involve in various physiological/pathological processes by interacting with proteins, compounds, and other rnas. a variety of powerful computational methods have been developed to predict such valuable interactions. however, all these methods rely heavily on the `digitalization' (also known as encoding') of rna-associated interacting pairs into a computer-recognizable descriptor. in other words, it is urgently needed to have a powerful tool that can not only represent each interacting partner but also integrate both partners into a computer-recognizable interaction. herein, rnaincoder (deep learning-based encoder for rna-associated interactions) was therefore proposed to (a) provide a comprehensive collection of rna encoding features, (b) realize the representation of any rna-associated interaction based on a well-established deep learning-based embedding strategy and (c) enable large-scale scanning of all possible feature combinations to identify the one of optimal performance in rna-associated interaction prediction. the effectiveness of rnaincoder was extensively validated by case studies on benchmark datasets. all in all, rnaincoder is distinguished for its capability in providing a more accurate representation of rna-associated interactions, which makes it an indispensable complement to other available tools. rnaincoder can be accessed at https://naincoder/ [graphics] .",AB_0317
"cross-modality visible-infrared person re-identification (vi-reid) aims to recognize images with the same identity between visible modality and infrared modality, which is a very challenging task because it not only includes the troubles of variations between cross-cameras in traditional person reid, but also suffers from the huge differences between two modalities. some existing vi-reid methods extract the modality-shared information from global features through single-stream or double-stream networks, while ignoring the complementarity between fine-grained and coarse-grained information. to solve this problem, our paper designs a multi-granularity feature utilization network (mfun) to make up for the lack of shared features between different modalities by promoting the complementarity between coarse-grained features and fine-grained features. firstly, in order to learn fine-grained shared features better, we design a local feature constraint module, which uses both hard-mining triplet loss and heterogeneous center loss to constrain local features in the common subspace, so as to better promote intra-class compactness and inter-class differences at the level of sample and class center. then, our method uses a multi-modality feature aggregationmodule for global features to fuse the information of two modalities to narrowthe modality gap. through the combination of these two modules, visible and infrared image features can be better fused, thus alleviating the problem of modality discrepancy and supplementing the lack of modality-shared information. extensive experimental results on regdb and sysu-mm01 datasets fully prove that our proposed mfun outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. our code is available at https://github.com/zhangyinyinzzz/mfun.",AB_0317
"flux balance analysis (fba) is an important method for calculating optimal pathways to produce industrially important chemicals in genome-scale metabolic models (gems). however, for biologists, the requirement of coding skills poses a significant obstacle to using fba for pathway analysis and engineering target identification. additionally, a time-consuming manual drawing process is often needed to illustrate the mass flow in an fba-calculated pathway, making it challenging to detect errors or discover interesting metabolic features. to solve this problem, we developed cave, a cloud-based platform for the integrated calculation, visualization, examination and correction of metabolic pathways. cave can analyze and visualize pathways for over 100 published gems or user-uploaded gems, allowing for quicker examination and identification of special metabolic features in a particular gem. additionally, cave offers model modification functions, such as gene/reaction removal or addition, making it easy for users to correct errors found in pathway analysis and obtain more reliable pathways. with a focus on the design and analysis of optimal pathways for biochemicals, cave complements existing visualization tools based on manually drawn global maps and can be applied to a broader range of organisms for rational metabolic engineering. cave is available at https://cave.biodesign.ac.cn/.",AB_0317
