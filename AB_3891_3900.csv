"ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides. regulation of ferroptosis might be beneficial to cancer treatment. non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are a class of rna transcripts that generally cannot encode proteins and have been demonstrated to play critical roles in regulating ferroptosis. herein, we developed ncfo, the ncrna-ferroptosis association database, to document the manually curated and predicted ncrnas that are associated with ferroptosis. collectively, ncfo contains 90 experimentally verified entries, including 46 micrornas (mirnas), 21 long non-coding rnas (lncrnas), and 17 circular rnas (circrnas). in addition, ncfo also incorporates two online prediction tools based on the regulation and co-expression of ncrna and ferroptosis genes. using default parameters, we obtained 3260 predicted entries, including 598 mirnas and 178 lncrnas, by regulation, as well as 2,592,661 predicted entries, including 967 mirnas and 9632 lncrnas, by ncrna-ferroptosis gene co-expression in more than 8000 samples across 20 cancer types. the detailed information of each entry includes ncrna name, disease, species, tissue, target, regulation, publication time, and pubmed identifier. ncfo also provides survival analysis and differential expression analysis for ncrnas. in summary, ncfo offers a user-friendly platform to search and predict ferroptosisassociated ncrnas, which might facilitate research on ferroptosis and discover potential targets for cancer treatment. ncfo can be accessed at http://www.jianglab.cn/ncfo/.",AB_0390
"integration of oncogenic dna viruses into the human genome is a key step in most virus induced carcinogenesis. here, we constructed a virus integration site (vis) atlas database, an extensive collection of integration breakpoints for three most prevalent oncoviruses, human papillomavirus, hepatitis b virus, and epstein-barr virus based on the next-generation sequencing (ngs) data, literature, and experimental data. there are 63,179 breakpoints and 47,411 junctional sequences with full annotations deposited in the vis atlas database, comprising 47 virus genotypes and 17 disease types. the vis atlas database provides (1) a genome browser for ngs breakpoint quality check, visualization of viss, and the local genomic context; (2) a novel platform to discover integration patterns; and (3) a statistics interface for a comprehensive investigation of genotype specific integration features. data collected in the vis atlas aid to provide insights into virus pathogenic mechanisms and the development of novel antitumor drugs. the vis atlas database is available at https://www.vis-atlas.tech/.",AB_0390
"organs-on-a-chip is a microfluidic microphysiological system that uses microfluidic technology to analyze the structure and function of living human cells at the tissue and organ levels in vitro. organs-on-a-chip technology, as opposed to traditional two-dimensional cell culture and animal models, can more closely simulate pathologic and toxicologic interactions between different organs or tissues and reflect the collaborative response of multiple organs to drugs. despite the fact that many organs-on-a-chip-related data have been published, none of the current databases have all of the following functions: searching, downloading, as well as analyzing data and results from the literature on organs-on-a-chip. therefore, we created an organs-on-a-chip database (oocdb) as a platform to integrate information about organs-on-a-chip from various sources, including literature, patents, raw data from microarray and transcriptome sequencing, several open-access datasets of organs-on-a-chip and organoids, and data generated in our laboratory. oocdb contains dozens of sub-databases and analysis tools, and each sub-database contains various data associated with organs-on-a-chip, with the goal of providing researchers with a comprehensive, systematic, and convenient search engine. furthermore, it offers a variety of other functions, such as mathematical modeling, three-dimensional modeling, and citation mapping, to meet the needs of researchers and promote the development of organs-on-a-chip. the oocdb is available at http:// www.organchip.cn.",AB_0390
"cancer therapy resistance and recurrence (ctrr) are the dominant causes of death in cancer patients. recent studies have indicated that non-coding rnas (ncrnas) can not only reverse the resistance to cancer therapy but also are crucial biomarkers for the evaluation and prediction of ctrr. herein, we developed ctrr-ncrna, a knowledgebase of ctrr-associated ncrnas, aim-ing to provide an accurate and comprehensive resource for research involving the association between ctrr and ncrnas. compared to most of the existing cancer databases, ctrr-ncrna is focused on the clinical characterization of cancers, including cancer subtypes, as well as survival outcomes and responses to personalized therapy of cancer patients. information pertain-ing to biomarker ncrnas has also been documented for the development of personalized ctrr prediction. a user-friendly interface and several functional modules have been incorporated into the database. based on the preliminary analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships, universal ncrnas have been found to be potential biomarkers for ctrr. the ctrr-ncrna is a translation-oriented knowledgebase and it provides a valuable resource for mechanistic investiga-tions and explainable artificial intelligence-based modeling. ctrr-ncrna is freely available to the public at http://ctrr.bioinf.org.cn/.",AB_0390
"identifying genetic risk factors for alzheimer's disease (ad) is an important research topic. to date, different endophenotypes, such as imaging-derived endophenotypes and proteomic expression-derived endophenotypes, have shown the great value in uncovering risk genes compared to case-control studies. biologically, a co-varying pattern of different omics-derived endophenotypes could result from the shared genetic basis. however, existing methods mainly focus on the effect of endophenotypes alone; the effect of cross-endophenotype (cep) associations remains largely unexploited. in this study, we used both endophenotypes and their cep associations of multi-omic data to identify genetic risk factors, and proposed two integrated multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis (inmtscca) methods, i.e., pairwise endophenotype correlation-guided mtscca (pcmtscca) and high-order endophenotype correlation-guided mtscca (hocmtscca). pcmtscca employed pairwise correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (mri)-derived, plasma-derived, and cerebrospinal fluid (csf)-derived endophenotypes as an additional penalty. hocmtscca used high-order correlations among these multi-omic data for regularization. to figure out genetic risk factors at individual and group levels, as well as altered endophenotypic markers, we introduced sparsity-inducing penalties for both models. we compared pcmtscca and hocmtscca with three related methods on both simulation and real (consisting of neuroimaging data, proteomic analytes, and genetic data) datasets. the results showed that our methods obtained better or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (cccs) and better feature subsets than benchmarks. most importantly, the identified genetic loci and heterogeneous endophenotypic markers showed high relevance. therefore, jointly using multi-omic endophenotypes and their cep associations is promising to reveal genetic risk factors. the source code and manual of inmtscca are available at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/bt007330.",AB_0390
"as one of the state-of-the-art automated function prediction (afp) methods, netgo 2.0 integrates multi-source information to improve the performance. however, it mainly utilizes the proteins with experimentally supported functional annotations without leveraging valuable information from a vast number of unannotated proteins. recently, protein language models have been proposed to learn informative representations [e.g., evolutionary scale modeling (esm)-1b embedding] from protein sequences based on self-supervision. here, we represented each protein by esm-1b and used logistic regression (lr) to train a new model, lr-esm, for afp. the experimental results showed that lr-esm achieved comparable performance with the best-performing component of netgo 2.0. therefore, by incorporating lr-esm into netgo 2.0, we developed netgo 3.0 to improve the performance of afp extensively. netgo 3.0 is freely accessible at https://dmiip.sjtu.edu.cn/ng3.0.",AB_0390
"mammals have evolved mechanisms to sense hypoxia and induce hypoxic responses. recently, high-throughput techniques have greatly promoted global studies of protein expression changes during hypoxia and the identification of candidate genes associated with hypoxia-adaptive evolution, which have contributed to the understanding of the complex regulatory net-works of hypoxia. in this study, we developed an integrated resource for the expression dynamics of proteins in response to hypoxia (ihypoxia), and this database contains 2589 expression events of 1944 proteins identified by low-throughput experiments (ltes) and 422,553 quantitative expres-sion events of 33,559 proteins identified by high-throughput experiments from five mammals that exhibit a response to hypoxia. various experimental details, such as the hypoxic experimental con-ditions, expression patterns, and sample types, were carefully collected and integrated. further-more, 8788 candidate genes from diverse species inhabiting low-oxygen environments were also integrated. in addition, we conducted an orthologous search and computationally identified 394,141 proteins that may respond to hypoxia among 48 animals. an enrichment analysis of human proteins identified from ltes shows that these proteins are enriched in certain drug targets and cancer genes. annotation of known posttranslational modification (ptm) sites in the proteins iden-tified by ltes reveals that these proteins undergo extensive ptms, particularly phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation. ihypoxia provides a convenient and user-friendly method for users to obtain hypoxia-related information of interest. we anticipate that ihypoxia, which is freely accessible at https://ihypoxia.omicsbio.info, will advance the understanding of hypoxia and serve as a valuable data resource.",AB_0390
"chromatin accessibility landscapes are essential for detecting regulatory elements, illustrating the corresponding regulatory networks, and, ultimately, understanding the molecular basis underlying key biological processes. with the advancement of sequencing technologies, a large volume of chromatin accessibility data has been accumulated and integrated for humans and other mammals. these data have greatly advanced the study of disease pathogenesis, cancer survival prognosis, and tissue development. to advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms regu-lating plant key traits and biological processes, we developed a comprehensive plant chromatin accessibility database (plantcadb) from 649 samples of 37 species. these samples are abiotic stress-related (such as heat, cold, drought, and salt; 159 samples), development-related (232 samples), and/or tissue-specific (376 samples). overall, 18,339,426 accessible chromatin regions (acrs) were compiled. these acrs were annotated with genomic information, associated genes, transcription factor footprint, motif, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). additionally, plantcadb provides various tools to visualize acrs and corresponding annotations. it thus forms an integrated, annotated, and analyzed plant-related chromatin accessibility resource, which can aid in better understanding genetic regulatory networks underlying development, important traits, stress adaptations, and evolution. plantcadb is freely available at https://bioinfor.nefu.edu.cn/plant-cadb/.",AB_0390
"disordered flexible linkers (dfls) are the functional disordered regions in proteins, which are the sub-regions of intrinsically disordered regions (idrs) and play important roles in connecting domains and maintaining inter-domain interactions. trained with the limited available dfls, the existing dfl predictors based on the machine learning techniques tend to predict the ordered residues as dfls, leading to a high false positive rate (fpr) and low prediction accuracy. previous studies have shown that dfls are extremely flexible disordered regions, which are usually predicted as disordered residues with high confidence [p(d) > 0.9] by an idr predictor. therefore, transferring an idr predictor to an accurate dfl predictor is of great significance for understanding the functions of idrs. in this study, we proposed a new predictor called transdfl for identifying dfls by transferring the rfpr-idp predictor for idr identification to the dfl prediction. the rfpr-idp was pre-trained with idr sequences to learn the general features between idrs and dfls, which is helpful to reduce the false positives in the ordered regions. rfpr-idp was fine-tuned with the dfl sequences to capture the specific features of dfls so as to be transferred into the transdfl. experimental results of two application scenarios (prediction of dfls only in idrs or prediction of dfls in entire proteins) showed that transdfl consistently outperformed other existing dfl predictors with higher accuracy. the corresponding web server of transdfl can be freely accessed at http://bliulab.net/transdfl/.",AB_0390
"in recent years, neoantigens have been recognized as ideal targets for tumor immunotherapy. with the development of neoantigen-based tumor immunotherapy, comprehensive neoantigen databases are urgently needed to meet the growing demand for clinical studies. we have built the tumor-specific neoantigen database (tsnadb) previously, which has attracted much attention. in this study, we provide tsnadb v2.0, an updated version of the tsnadb. tsnadb v2.0 offers several new features, including (1) adopting more stringent criteria for neoantigen identification, (2) providing predicted neoantigens derived from three types of somatic mutations, and (3) collecting experimentally validated neoantigens and dividing them according to the experimental level. tsnadb v2.0 is freely available at https://pgx.zju.edu.cn/tsnadb/.",AB_0390
