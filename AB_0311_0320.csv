"over the last decade, rna-seq has produced a massive amount of plant transcriptomic sequencing data deposited in public databases. reanalysis of these public datasets can generate additional novel hypotheses not included in original studies. however, the large data volume and the requirement for specialized computational resources and expertise present a barrier for experimental biologists to explore public repositories. here, we introduce plantexp (https://biotec.njau.edu.cn/plantexp), a database platform for exploration of plant gene expression and alternative splicing profiles based on 131 423 uniformly processed publicly available rna-seq samples from 85 species in 24 plant orders.in addition to two common retrieval accesses to gene expression and alternative splicing profiles by functional terms and sequence similarity, plantexp is equipped with four online analysis tools, including differential expression analysis, specific expression analysis, co-expression network analysis and cross-species expression conservation analysis. with these online analysis tools,users can flexibly customize sample groups to reanalyze public rna-seq datasets and obtain new insights. furthermore, it offers a wide range of visualization tools to help users intuitively understand analysis results. in conclusion, plantexp provides a valuable data resource and analysis platform for plant biologists to utilize public rna-seq. datasets.",AB_0032
"the cucurbitaceae (cucurbit) family consists of about 1,000 species in 95 genera, including many economically important and popular fruit and vegetable crops. during the past several years, reference genomes have been generated for >20 cucurbit species, and variome and transcriptome profiling data have been rapidly accumulated for cucurbits. to efficiently mine, analyze and disseminate these large-scale datasets, we have developed an updated version of cucurbit genomics database. the updated database, cugendbv2 (http://cucurbitgenomics.org/v2), currently hosts 34 reference genomes from 27 cucurbit species/subspecies belonging to 10 different genera. protein-coding genes from these genomes have been comprehensively annotated by comparing their protein sequences to various public protein and domain databases. a novel 'genotype' module has been implemented to facilitate mining and analysis of the functionally annotated variome data including snps and small indels from large-scale genome sequencing projects. an updated 'expression' module has been developed to provide a comprehensive gene expression atlas for cucurbits. furthermore, synteny blocks between any two and within each of the 34 genomes, representing a total of 595 pair-wise genome comparisons, have been identified and can be explored and visualized in the database.",AB_0032
"single-cell transcriptome has enabled the transcriptional profiling of thousands of immune cells in complex tissues and cancers. however, subtle transcriptomic differences in immune cell subpopulations and the high dimensionality of transcriptomic data make the clustering and annotation of immune cells challenging. herein, we introduce immcluster (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/immcluster) for immunology cell type clustering and annotation. we manually curated 346 well-known marker genes from 1163 studies. immcluster integrates over 420 000 immune cells from nine healthy tissues and over 648 000 cells from different tumour samples of 17 cancer types to generate stable marker-gene sets and develop context-specific immunology references. in addition, immcluster provides cell clustering using seven reference-based and four marker gene-based computational methods, and the ensemble method was developed to provide consistent cell clustering than individual methods. five major analytic modules were provided for interactively exploring the annotations of immune cells, including clustering and annotating immune cell clusters, gene expression of markers, functional assignment in cancer hallmarks, cell states and immune pathways, cell-cell communications and the corresponding ligand-receptor interactions, as well as online tools. immcluster generates diverse plots and tables, enabling users to identify significant associations in immune cell clusters simultaneously. immcluster is a valuable resource for analysing cellular heterogeneity in cancer microenvironments.",AB_0032
"fungal taxonomy is a complex and rapidly changing subject, which makes proper naming of fungi challenging for taxonomists. a registration platform with a standardized and information-integrated database is a powerful tool for efficient research on fungal taxonomy. fungal names (fn, https://nmdc.cn/fungalnames/; launched in 2011) is one of the three official fungal nomenclatural repositories authorized by the international nomenclature committee for fungi (ncf). currently, fn includes >567 000 taxon names from >10 000 related journals and books published since 1596 and covers >147 000 collection records of type specimens/illustrations from >5000 preserving agencies. fn is also a knowledge base that integrates nomenclature information with specimens, culture collections and herbaria/fungaria, publications and taxonomists, and represents a summary of the history and recent advances in fungal taxonomy. published fungal names are categorized based on well-accepted nomenclature rules and can be readily searched with different keywords and strategies. in combination with a standardized name checking tool and a sequence alignment-based identification package, fn makes the registration and typification of nomenclatural novelties of fungi convenient and accurate.",AB_0032
"organoids, three-dimensional in vitro tissue cultures derived from pluripotent (embryonic or induced) or adult stem cells, are promising models for the study of human processes and structures, disease onset and preclinical drug development. an increasing amount of omics data has been generated for organoid studies. here, we introduce organoiddb (http://www.inbirg.com/organoid_db/), a comprehensive resource for the multi-perspective exploration of the transcriptomes of organoids. the current release of organoiddb includes curated bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiles of 16 218 organoid samples from both human and mouse. other types of samples, such as primary tissue and cell line samples, are also integrated to enable comparisons with organoids. organoiddb enables queries of gene expression under different modes, e.g. across different organoid types, between different organoids from different sources or protocols, between organoids and other sample types, across different development stages, and via correlation analysis. datasets and organoid samples can also be browsed for detailed information, including organoid information, differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways and single-cell clustering. organoiddb will facilitate a better understanding of organoids and help improve organoid culture protocols to yield organoids that are highly similar to living organs in terms of composition, architecture and function.",AB_0032
"transcription factors (tfs) are proteins that interact with specific dna sequences to regulate gene expression and play crucial roles in all kinds of biological processes. to keep up with new data and provide a more comprehensive resource for tf research, we updated the animal transcription factor database (animaltfdb) to version 4.0 (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/animaltfdb4/) with up-to-date data and functions. we refined the tf family rules and prediction pipeline to predict tfs in genome-wide protein sequences from ensembl. as a result, we predicted 274 633 tf genes and 150 726 transcription cofactor genes in animaltfdb 4.0 in 183 animal genomes, which are 86 more species than animaitfdb 3.0. besides double data volume, we also added the following new annotations and functions to the database: (i) variations (including mutations ) on tf genes in various human cancers and other diseases; (ii) predicted post-translational modification sites (including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination sites) on tfs in 8 species; (iii) tf regulation in autophagy; (iv) comprehensive tf expression annotation for 38 species; (v) exact and batch search functions allow users to search animaltfdb flexibly. animaltfdb 4.0 is a useful resource for studying tf and transcription regulation, which contains comprehensive annotation and classification of tfs and transcription cofactors.",AB_0032

"genetically modified organisms (gmos) can be generated to model human genetic disease or plant disease resistance, and they have contributed to the exploration and understanding of gene function, physiology, disease onset and drug target discovery. here, pertorg (http://www.inbirg.com/pertorg/) was introduced to provide multilevel alterations in gmos. raw data of 58 707 transcriptome profiles and associated information, such as phenotypic alterations, were collected and curated from studies involving in vivo genetic perturbation (e.g. knockdown, knockout and overexpression) in eight model organisms, including mouse, rat and zebrafish. the transcriptome profiles from before and after perturbation were organized into 10 116 comparison datasets, including 122 single-cell rna-seq datasets. the raw data were checked and analysed using widely accepted and standardized pipelines to identify differentially expressed genes (degs) in perturbed organisms. as a result, 8 644 148 degs were identified and deposited as signatures of gene perturbations. downstream functional enrichment analysis, cell type analysis and phenotypic alterations were also provided when available. multiple search methods and analytical tools were created and implemented. furthermore, case studies were presented to demonstrate how users can utilize the database. pertorg 1.0 will be a valuable resource aiding in the exploration of gene functions, biological processes and disease models.",AB_0032
"in recent years, the explosive growth of spatial technologies has enabled the characterization of spatial heterogeneity of tissue architectures. compared to traditional sequencing, spatial transcriptomics reserves the spatial information of each captured location and provides novel insights into diverse spatially related biological contexts. even though two spatial transcriptomics databases exist, they provide limited analytical information. information such as spatial heterogeneity of genes and cells, cell-cell communication activities in space, and the cell type compositions in the microenvironment are critical clues to unveil the mechanism of tumorigenesis and embryo differentiation. therefore, we constructed a new spatial transcriptomics database, named spascer (https://ccsm.uth.edu/spascer), designed to help understand the heterogeneity of tissue organizations, region-specific microenvironment, and intercellular interactions across tissue architectures at multiple levels. spascer contains datasets from 43 studies, including 1082 sub-datasets from 16 organ types across four species. scrna-seq was integrated to deconvolve/map spatial transcriptomics, and processed with spatial cell-cell interaction, gene pattern and pathway enrichment analysis. cell-cell interactions and gene regulation network of scrna-seq from matched spatial transcriptomics were performed as well. the application of spascer will provide new insights into tissue architecture and a solid foundation for the mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in healthy and diseased tissues.",AB_0032
"during the complex process of tumour development, the unique destiny of cells is driven by the fine-tuning of multilevel features such as gene expression, network regulation and pathway activation. the dynamic formation of the tumour microenvironment influences the therapeutic response and clinical outcome. thus, characterizing the developmental landscape and identifying driver features at multiple levels will help us understand the pathological development of disease in individual cell populations and further contribute to precision medicine. here, we describe a database, celltracer (http://bio-bigdata. hrbmu.edu.cn/celltracer), which aims to dissect the causative multilevel interplay contributing to cell development trajectories. celltracer consists of the gene expression profiles of 1 941 552 cells from 222 single-cell datasets and provides the development trajectories of different cell populations exhibiting diverse behaviours. by using celltracer, users can explore the significant alterations in molecular events and causative multilevel crosstalk among genes, biological contexts, cell characteristics and clinical treatments along distinct cell development trajectories. celltracer also provides 12 flexible tools to retrieve and analyse gene expression, cell cluster distribution, cell development trajectories, cell-state variations and their relationship under different conditions. collectively, celltracer will provide comprehensive insights for investigating the causative multilevel interplay contributing to cell development trajectories and serve as a foundational resource for biomarker discovery and therapeutic exploration within the tumour microenvironment.",AB_0032
