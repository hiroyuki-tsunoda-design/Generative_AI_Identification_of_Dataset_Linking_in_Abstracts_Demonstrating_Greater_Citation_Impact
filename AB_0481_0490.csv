"purpose a wide therapeutic repertoire has become available to oncologists including radio-and chemotherapy, small molecules and monoclonal antibodies. however, drug efficacy can be limited by genetic heterogeneity. here, we designed a webtool that facilitates the data analysis of the in vitro drug sensitivity data on 265 approved compounds from the gdsc database in association with a plethora of genetic changes documented for 1001 cell lines in the ccle data. methods the webtool computes odds ratios of drug resistance for a queried set of genetic alterations. it provides results on the efficacy of single compounds or groups of compounds assigned to cellular signaling pathways. webtool availability: https://tools.hornlab.org/gdsc/. results we first replicated established associations of genetic driver mutations in braf, ras genes and egfr with drug response. we then tested the brcaness' hypothesis and did not find increased sensitivity to the assayed parp inhibitors. analyzing specific pik3ca mutations related to cancer and mendelian overgrowth, we found support for the described sensitivity of h1047 mutants to gsk690693 targeting the akt pathway. testing a co-mutated gene pair, gata3 activation abolished pten-related sensitivity to pi3k/mtor inhibition. finally, the pharmacogenomic modifier abcb1 was associated with olaparib resistance. conclusions this tool could identify potential drug candidates in the presence of custom sets of genetic changes and moreover, improve the understanding of signaling pathways. the underlying computer code can be adapted to larger drug response datasets to help structure and accommodate the increasingly large biomedical knowledge base.",AB_0049
"r and matlab are two high-level scientific programming languages which are frequently applied in natural sciences like physics, mathematics and computational biology. new methods and applications are often implemented solely in r or solely in matlab. here, we present the rcall interface which provides users with access to the wide variety of methods programmed in r and in matlab. rcall runs in matlab and provides direct access to methods and software packages implemented in r, accessible for example from bioconductor or cran. the easy combination of matlab and r methods greatly extends the functionality of the matlab programming environment and makes rcall wellsuited for benchmarking implementations of the two programming languages. the matlab source code is available at https://github.com/kreutz-lab/rcall. rcall is supported on linux, unix-like, ms windows and mac os x systems.

"we introduce binpo, an open-source python code to compute electronic properties of two-dimensional electron systems. a bulk tight binding hamiltonian is constructed from relativistic density functional theory calculations represented in the basis of maximally localized wannier functions. binpo has a schrodinger-poisson solver, integrating an electric field-dependent relative permittivity to obtain self -consistently the confining electrostatic potential energy term in the derived tight binding slab system. the band structure, energy slices, and other properties, along with different projections and orientations can be computed. high resolution and publishable figures of the simulations can be generated. in binpo, priority has been given to ease-of-use, efficiency, readability and modularity, therefore becoming suitable to produce reliable electronic structures simulations at low computational cost. along with the code itself, we provide files from first-principles calculations for some materials, instructions of use, and detailed examples of its wide range of capabilities. the code was developed with a focus on the abo(3) perovskite structure-based systems, such as srtio3 and ktao3, because of their increasing impact in the materials community. some features, such as the projection onto orbital states, are restricted to calculations using the relevant t(2g) orbitals for this family of materials, yet it is possible to include more elements in the basis for the band structure determination of other systems. the use of a relativistic approach allows for the inspection of the role of spin-orbit coupling and the resulting rashba effect on the systems. we detail the approaches used in the code, so that it can be further exploited and adapted to other problems, such as adding new materials and functionalities which can strength the initial code scopes.program summaryprogram title: binpocpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /zk4xy7vfy4 .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /emanuelm33 /binpocode ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /0987578licensing provisions: gplv3programming language: pythonexternal routines/libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ase.nature of problem: compute the band structure and other electronic properties in two-dimensional electron systems.solution method: construction of a slab hamiltonian from one built using a basis of maximally localized wannier functions. solve the schrodinger-poisson scheme to get the self-consistent potential energy along the slab. use this potential to compute the band structure and additional properties by solving the schrodinger equation. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: other features included are the visualization of the self-consistent process and final solutions, band structure and energy slices with different projections. high resolution and customizable figures can be obtained in all cases.(c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0049
"background and objective: connectivity studies make it possible to identify alterations in brain connec-tions and to associate these pathologies with different neurological disorders. however, a clinical test is necessary to obtain information about the state of the brain. electroencephalograms (eegs) provide this information in addition to being tests with other benefits for the patient (non-invasive, low-cost, high reproducibility). graph theory can be used to represent both the anatomical and functional connec-tions of the brain by means of connectivity measures. the procedure of transforming an eeg into a graph can be slightly tedious for researchers, especially when implementing different connectivity measures. methods: the open-source python library eegraph automatically performs the modeling of an eeg through a graph, providing its matrix and visual representation. it recognizes various eeg input formats, identifying the number of electrodes and the location of each electrode in the brain. moreover, it allows the user to choose from 12 connectivity measures to produce the graph from the eeg, with great flexi-bility to define specific parameters to adapt them to each study, including eeg time-windows segmen-tation and separation in frequency bands. results: the eegraph library is developed as a tool, for researchers and clinical specialists in the field of neuroscience, that provides direct information on the connectivity of the brain from electroencephalog-raphy signals. its documentation and source code are available at https://github.com/ufvceiec/eegraph. it can be installed from the python package index using pip install eegraph. conclusions: the eegraph library was built aiming to facilitate the development of connectivity studies based on the modeling of electroencephalography tests through graphs. it includes a wide range of con-nectivity measures, which, together with the multiple output options, make eegraph an easy to use and powerful tool with direct applications in both the clinical and neuroscience research fields.

"in this paper, we present our approach for the helsinki deblur challenge (hdc2021). the task of this challenge is to deblur images of char-acters without knowing the point spread function (psf). the organizers pro-vided a dataset of pairs of sharp and blurred images. our method consists of three steps: first, we estimate a warping transformation of the images to align the sharp images with the blurred ones. next, we estimate the psf using a quasi-newton method. the estimated psf allows to generate addi-tional pairs of sharp and blurred images. finally, we train a deep convolu-tional neural network to reconstruct the sharp images from the blurred im-ages. our method is able to successfully reconstruct images from the first 10 stages of the hdc 2021 dataset. our code is available at https://github. com/hhu-machine-learning/hdc2021-psfnn.",AB_0049
"maintaining the identity of multiple objects in real-time video is a challenging task, as it is not always feasible to run a detector on every frame. thus, motion estimation systems are often employed, which ei-ther do not scale well with the number of targets or produce features with limited semantic information. to solve the aforementioned problems and allow the tracking of dozens of arbitrary objects in real-time, we propose siammotion. siammotion includes a novel proposal engine that produces quality features through an attention mechanism and a region-of-interest extractor fed by an inertia module and pow-ered by a feature pyramid network. finally, the extracted tensors enter a comparison head that efficiently matches pairs of exemplars and search areas, generating quality predictions via a pairwise depthwise re-gion proposal network and a multi-object penalization module. siammotion has been validated on five public benchmarks, achieving leading performance against current state-of-the-art trackers. code avail-able at: https://www.github.com/lorenzovaquero/siammotion (c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license (  )",AB_0049
"the industrial application of deep reinforcement learning (drl) is frequently slowed down due to an inability to generate the experience required to train the models. collecting data often involves considerable time and financial outlays that can make it unaffordable. fortunately, devices like robots can be trained with synthetic experience through virtual environments. with this approach, the problems of sample efficiency with artificial agents are mitigated, but another issue arises: the need to efficiently transfer the synthetic experience into the real world (sim-to-real). this paper analyzes the robustness of a state-of-the-art sim-to-real technique known as progressive neural networks (pnns) and studies how adding diversity to the synthetic experience can complement it. to better understand the drivers that lead to a lack of robustness, the robotic agent is still tested in a virtual environment to ensure total control on the divergence between the simulated and real models. the results show that a pnn-like agent exhibits a substantial decrease in its robustness at the beginning of the real training phase. randomizing specific variables during simulation-based training significantly mitigates this issue. the average increase in the model's accuracy is around 25% when diversity is introduced in the training process. this improvement can translate into a decrease in the number of real experiences required for the same final robust performance. notwithstanding, adding real experience to agents should still be beneficial, regardless of the quality of the virtual experience fed to the agent. the source code is available at: https://gitlab.com/comillas-cic/sim-to-real/pnn-dr.git.",AB_0049
"depth estimation is a challenging task of 3d reconstruction to enhance the accuracy sensing of environ-ment awareness. this work brings a new solution with improvements, which increases the quantitative and qualitative understanding of depth maps compared to existing methods. recently, convolutional neural networks (cnn) have demonstrated their extraordinary ability to estimate depth maps from monocular videos. however, traditional cnn does not support a topological structure, and they can work only on regular image regions with determined sizes and weights. on the other hand, graph convolu-tional networks (gcn) can handle the convolution of non-euclidean data, and they can be applied to irregular image regions within a topological structure. therefore, to preserve object geometric appear-ances and objects locations in the scene, in this work, we aim to exploit gcn for a self-supervised monoc-ular depth estimation model. our model consists of two parallel auto-encoder networks: the first is an auto-encoder that will depend on resnet-50 and extract the feature from the input image and on multi-scale gcn to estimate the depth map. in turn, the second network will be used to estimate the ego-motion vector (i.e., 3d pose) between two consecutive frames based on resnet-18. the estimated 3d pose and depth map will be used to construct the target image. a combination of loss functions related to photometric, reprojection, and smoothness is used to cope with bad depth prediction and pre-serve the discontinuities of the objects. our method and performance are improved quantitatively and qualitatively. in particular, our method provided comparable and promising results with a high predic-tion accuracy of 89% on the publicly available kitti dataset. our method also offers 40% reduction in the number of trainable parameters compared to the state of the art solutions.in addition, we tested our trained model with make3d dataset to evaluate the trained model on a new dataset with low reso-lution images. the source code is publicly available at (https://github.com/arminmasoumian/gcndepth. git)(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0049
"motivation: drug discovery practitioners in industry and academia use semantic tools to extract information from online scientific literature to generate new insights into targets, therapeutics and diseases. however, due to complexities in access and analysis, patent-based literature is often overlooked as a source of information. as drug discovery is a highly competitive field, naturally, tools that tap into patent literature can provide any actor in the field an advantage in terms of better informed decision-making. hence, we aim to facilitate access to patent literature through the creation of an automatic tool for extracting information from patents described in existing public resources. results: here, we present pemt, a novel patent enrichment tool, that takes advantage of public databases like chembl and surechembl to extract relevant patent information linked to chemical structures and/or gene names described through fair principles and metadata annotations. pemt aims at supporting drug discovery and research by establishing a patent landscape around genes of interest. the pharmaceutical focus of the tool is mainly due to the subselection of international patent classification codes, but in principle, it can be used for other patent fields, provided that a link between a concept and chemical structure is investigated. finally, we demonstrate a use-case in rare diseases by generating a gene-patent list based on the epidemiological prevalence of these diseases and exploring their underlying patent landscapes. availability and implementation: pemt is an open-source python tool and its source code and pypi package are available at https://github.com/fraunhofer-itmp/pemt and https://pypi.org/project/pemt/, respectively. contact: yojana.gadiya@itmp.fraunhofer.de supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0049
"ai-driven protein structure prediction, most notably alphafold2 (af2) opens new frontiers for almost all fields of structural biology. as traditional structure prediction methods for transmembrane proteins were both complicated and error prone, af2 is a great help to the community. complementing the relatively meager number of experimental structures, af2 provides 3d predictions for thousands of new alpha-helical membrane proteins. however, the lack of reliable structural templates and the fact that af2 was not trained to handle phase boundaries also necessitates a delicate assessment of structural correctness. in our new database, transmembrane alphafold database (tmalphafold database), we apply tmdet, a simple geometry-based method to visualize the likeliest position of the membrane plane. in addition, we calculate several parameters to evaluate the location of the protein into the membrane. this also allows tmalphafold database to show whether the predicted 3d structure is realistic or not. the tmalphafold database is available at https://tmalphafold.ttk.hu/..",AB_0049
