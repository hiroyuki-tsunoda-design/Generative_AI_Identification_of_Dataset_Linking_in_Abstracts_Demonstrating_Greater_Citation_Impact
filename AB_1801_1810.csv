"change detection (cd) in remote sensing images is one of the most important technical options to identify changes in observations in an efficient manner. cd has a wide range of applications, such as land use investigation, urban planning, environmental monitoring and disaster mapping. however, the frequently occurring class imbalance problem brings huge challenges to the change detection applications. to address this issue, we develop a novel global-aware siamese network (gas-net), aiming to generate global-aware features for efficient change detection by incorporating the relationships between scenes and foregrounds. the proposed gas-net, consisting of the global-attention module (gam) and foreground-awareness module (fam) that both learns contextual relationships and enhances symbiotic relation learning between scene and foreground. the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed gas-net, achieving up to 91.21% and 95.84% f1 score on two widely used public datasets, i.e., levir-cd and lebedev-cd dataset. the source code is available at https://github.com/xiaoxiangaq/gas-net.",AB_0181

"objective: risk stratification of patients with congestive heart failure (hf) is vital in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to construct a machine learning model to predict the in-hospital all-cause mortality for intensive care unit (icu) patients with hf.methods: extreme gradient boosting algorithm (xgboost) was used to construct a new prediction model (xgboost model) from the medical information mart for intensive care iv database (mimic-iv) (training set). the eicu collaborative research database dataset (eicu-crd) was used for the external validation (test set). the xgboost model performance was compared with a logistic regression model and an existing model (get with the guideline-heart failure model) for mortality in the test set. area under the receiver operating characteristic cure and brier score were employed to evaluate the discrimination and the calibration of the three models. the shapley additive explanations (shap) value was applied to explain xgboost model and calculate the importance of its features.results: the total of 11,156 and 9,837 patients with congestive hf from the training set and test set, respectively, were included in the study. in-hospital all-cause mortality occurred in 13.3% (1,484/11,156) and 13.4% (1,319/9,837) of patients, respectively. in the training set, of 17 features with the highest predictive value were selected into the models with lasso regression. acute physiology score iii (aps iii), age and sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) were strongest predictors in shap. in the external validation, the xgboost model performance was superior to that of conventional risk predictive methods, with an area under the curve of 0.771 (95% confidence interval, 0.757-0.784) and a brier score of 0.100. in the evaluation of clinical effectiveness, the machine learning model brought a positive net benefit in the threshold probability of 0%-90%, prompting evident competitiveness compare to the other two models. this model has been translated into an online calculator which is accessible freely to the public (https://nkuwangkai-app-for-mortality-prediction-app-a8mhkf.streamlit.app).conclusion: this study developed a valuable machine learning risk stratification tool to accurately assess and stratify the risk of in-hospital all-cause mortality in icu patients with congestive hf. this model was translated into a web-based calculator which access freely.",AB_0181
"structural variations (svs) represent genomic rearrangements (such as deletions, insertions, and inversions) whose sizes are larger than 50bp. they play important roles in genetic diseases and evolution mechanism. due to the advance of long-read sequencing (i.e. pacbio long-read sequencing and oxford nanopore (ont) long-read sequencing), we can call svs accurately. however, for ont long reads, we observe that existing long read sv callers miss a lot of true svs and call a lot of false svs in repetitive regions and in regions with multi-allelic svs. those errors are caused by messy alignments of ont reads due to their high error rate. hence, we propose a novel method, svsearcher, to solve these issues. we run svsearcher and other callers in three real datasets and find that svsearcher improves the f1 score by approximately 10% for high coverage (50x) datasets and more than 25% for low coverage (10x) datasets. more importantly, svsearcher can identify 81.7%-91.8% multi-allelic svs while existing methods only identify 13.2% (sniffles)-54.0% (nanosv) of them. svsearcher is available at https://github.com/kensung-lab/svsearcher.",AB_0181
"cis-regulatory elements regulate gene expression and play an essential role in the development and physiology of organisms. many conserved non-coding sequences (cnss) function as cis-regulatory elements. they control the development of various lineages. however, predicting clade-wide cis-regulatory elements across several closely related species remains challenging. based on the relationship between cnss and cis-regulatory elements, we present a computational approach that predicts the clade-wide putative cis-regulatory elements in 12 cucurbitaceae genomes. using 12-way whole-genome alignment, we first obtained 632112 cnss in cucurbitaceae. next, we identified 16552 cucurbitaceae-wide cis-regulatory elements based on collinearity among all 12 cucurbitaceae plants. furthermore, we predicted 3 271 potential regulatory pairs in the cucumber genome, of which 98 were verified using integrative rna sequencing and chip sequencing datasets from samples collected during various fruit development stages. the cnss, cucurbitaceae-wide cis-regulatory elements, and their target genes are accessible at http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/cisrcnes_cucurbit/. these elements are valuable resources for functionally annotating cnss and their regulatory roles in cucurbitaceae genomes.",AB_0181

"objective: drug resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug adriamycin (adr) is a key clinical impediment to successful breast cancer treatment (brca). however, the molecular mechanism and targets that mediate adr resistance remain unclear. therefore, the identification of adr response biomarkers to improve the treatment of patients with brca is an urgent issue. methods: the gse24460 dataset on gene expression omnibus (geo) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) was employed in this investigation, which covers gene expression profiles of parental and adr-resistant cell lines of mcf-7 (cell lines in the human breast cancer). differentially expressed genes (degs) in parental and adr-resistant cells, gene ontology (go) enrichment analysis, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathway studies, and the interactions of protein-protein were used to identify the overall biological alterations (ppis). the most prevalent degs in the ppi, go, and kegg pathways were discovered and using gse34138 dataset from the geo database were validated, and their ability to forecast overall survival (os) and relapse-free survival (rfs) was clinically validated. the link between the degs and os/rfs was studied after further verification of the most common degs in those pathways. the most significant crucial gene, collagen type-iv alpha 1 (col4a1), was discovered in the mcf-7 and mcf-7/adr cells using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr, western blot, and cell counting kit-8 assays to further highlight the distinctions. results: 207 degs in total were discovered, with 111 upregulated and 96 downregulated. after mapping the gos, pathways, and ppi networks, six genes-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (cdkn2a), retinoblastoma 1 (rb1), c-x-c motif ligand 12 (cxcl12), col4a1, intercellular cell molecule-1 of adhesion (icam1), and cadherin 1 (cdh1)-were found to be frequently enriched. col4a1 was found to be favorably associated with adr resistance and poor os, as well as strongly associated with rfs. the correlation between cdh1 and adr resistance was negative, which was substantial in terms of poor rfs. in mcf7/adr cells, col4a1 also expression was noted to have increased, and col4a1 knockdown significantly reduced the inhibitory concentration 50% value of adr in those cells. conclusions: our data identified the significant pathways and genes for predicting the emergence of adr resistance and revealed that col4a1 regulated the proliferation of mcf-7/adr and played a crucial role in adr resistance. therefore, col4a1 shows that it can be novel target for improving patients' prognosis with adr-resistant brca.",AB_0181
"with the proliferation of a wide variety of sensors, accurate multi-source image registration is crucial for many remote sensing image processing tasks. however, the registration of multi-source images faces the challenges of rotations, scales, and domain transformations caused by significant differences in shooting time, viewing angle, and sensor imaging modes. to cope with this problem, we propose a deep learning-based registration method named trfeat, which aims to comprehensively improve the rotation, scale, and cross-domain robustness of local features. first, we introduce a special circular sampling convolutional layer to replace the standard square convolutional layer, in order to enhance the rotational robustness of local features. second, we design a scale pyramid backbone network architecture to improve the robustness of the network to scale transformations. third, we promote the use of hypercolumn domain alignment loss to extract cross-domain robust local descriptors for images from different sources. in addition, we develop a novel keypoint detection training framework based on iterative refinement supervision to obtain repeatable and reliable keypoints localization in multi-source images. finally, we conduct thorough experiments on five multi-source datasets. extensive experimental results validate that our trfeat outperforms other state-of-the-art hand-crafted (e.g. rift) and deep learning-based methods (e.g. aslfeat). specifically, our trfeat achieves an mma@3 of 76.08% on the hpatches dataset and an rmse of 3.38 on the xiang dataset. the code is available at https://github.com/vignywang/trfeat.",AB_0181
"x-ray image plays an important role in manufacturing industry for quality assurance, because it can reflect the internal condition of weld region. however, the shape and scale of different defect types vary greatly, which makes it challenging for model to detect weld defects. in this article, we propose a weld defect detection method based on convolution neural network (cnn), namely, lighter and faster yolo (lf-yolo). in particular, a reinforced multiscale feature (rmf) module is designed to implement both parameterbased and parameter-free multiscale information extracting operations. rmf enables the extracted feature map to represent more plentiful information, which is achieved by a superior hierarchical fusion structure. to improve the performance of detection network, we propose an efficient feature extraction (efe) module. efe processes input data with extremely low consumption and improves the practicability of whole network in actual industry. experimental results show that our weld defect detection network achieves satisfactory balance between performance and consumption and reaches 92.9 mean average precision (map50) with 61.5 frames/s. to further prove the ability of our method, we test it on the public dataset ms coco, and the results show that our lf-yolo has an outstanding versatility detection performance. the code is available at https://github.com/lmomoy/lf-yolo.",AB_0181
"since both visible and infrared images have their own advantages and disadvantages, rgbt tracking plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. the key points of rgbt tracking lie in feature extraction and fusion of visible and infrared images. current rgbt tracking methods mostly pay attention to both individual features (features extracted from images of a single camera) and common features (features extracted and fused from an rgb camera and a thermal camera). still, they pay less attention to different and dynamic contributions of the individual and common features for different sequences of registered image pairs. this paper proposes a novel rgbt tracking method, called dynamic fusion network (dfnet), which adopts a two-stream structure, in which two non-shared convolution kernels are employed in each layer to extract individual features. besides, dfnet has shared convolution kernels for each layer to extract common features. since non-shared and shared convolution kernels are adaptively weighted and summed according to different image pairs, dfnet can deal with different contributions for different sequences. dfnet has a fast speed, which is 28.658 fps. the experimental results show that when dfnet only increases the mult-adds by 0.02% compared with the non-shared-convolution-kernel-based fusion method, precision rate (pr) and success rate (sr) reach 88.1% and 71.9%, respectively. the model and dataset are available at https://github.com/pengjingchao/dfnet.",AB_0181
