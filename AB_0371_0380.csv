"molecular property prediction is an essential but challenging task in drug discovery. the recurrent neural network (rnn) and transformer are the mainstream methods for sequence modeling, and both have been successfully applied independently for molecular property prediction. as the local information and global information of molecules are very important for molecular properties, we aim to integrate the bi-directional gated recurrent unit (bigru) into the original transformer encoder, together with self-attention to better capture local and global molecular information simultaneously. to this end, we propose the trangru approach, which encodes the local and global information of molecules by using the bigru and self-attention, respectively. then, we use a gate mechanism to reasonably fuse the two molecular representations. in this way, we enhance the ability of the proposed model to encode both local and global molecular information. compared to the baselines and state-of-the-art methods when treating each task as a single-task classification on tox21, the proposed approach outperforms the baselines on 9 out of 12 tasks and state-of-the-art methods on 5 out of 12 tasks. trangru also obtains the best roc-auc scores on bbbp, fda, logp, and tox21 (multitask classification) and has a comparable performance on toxcast, bace, and ecoli. on the whole, trangru achieves better performance for molecular property prediction. the source code is available in github: https://github.com/jiangjing0122/trangru.",AB_0038
"imperceptible adversarial examples are capable of deceiving the deep neural networks with high confi-dence. recent studies show that it is particularly effective to control the attack space to low-frequency components of the image on the basis of adversarial training. however, those methods face the problem of losing valuable knowledge, especially shape information, which is vital for classification and robust-ness. to alleviate this issue, we propose a new method based on edge detection, named edge enhancement (ee), which can explicitly make up for the missing shape information in frequency con-straints and further enhance the adversarial robustness. specifically, we first employ a traditional edge detection algorithm called canny to obtain shape information due to its simplicity and intrinsic robust-ness. then, we augment the low-frequency space via obtained shape features, with the weighting oper-ation carried on. this operation can be regarded as an emphasis on shape information, which could mitigate the texture bias of deep neural networks, thereby further serving the robustness. finally, we feed the augmented features into the deep neural network. it is worth noting that these modules are opti-mized along with the deep neural network, which enables an end-to-end training fashion. experimental results show that our proposed model can significantly improve adversarial robustness over the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, including mnist, tiny imagenet, and particularly imagenet. for example, our method achieves 51.66% accuracy on imagenet under 10 -iteration targeted pgd white-box attack where the prior art has 36.94% accuracy. code is available at https://github.com/aiqz/edge-enhancement.

"classification of long sequential data is an important machine learning task and appears in many application scenarios. recurrent neural networks, transformers, and convolutional neural networks are three major techniques for learning from sequential data. among these methods, temporal convolutional networks (tcns) which are scalable to very long sequences have achieved remarkable progress in time series regression. however, the performance of tcns for sequence classification is not satisfactory because they use a skewed connection protocol and output classes at the last position. such asymmetry restricts their performance for classification which depends on the whole sequence. in this work, we propose a symmetric multi-scale architecture called circular dilated convolutional neural network (cdilcnn), where every position has an equal chance to receive information from other positions at the previous layers. our model gives classification logits in all positions, and we can apply a simple ensemble learning to achieve a better decision. we have tested cdil-cnn on various long sequential datasets. the experimental results show that our method has superior performance over many state-of-the-art approaches. the model and experiments are available at (https://github.com/leicheng-no/cdil-cnn).

"in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of underwater object detection (uod). uod has evolved into an attractive research field in the computer vision community in recent years. however, existing uod datasets collected from specific underwater scenes are limited in the number of images, categories, resolution, and environmental challenges. these limitations can lead to the settings and effec-tiveness of models trained on existing datasets being impaired in general underwater situations. these limitations also constrain the comprehensive exploration of uod. to alleviate these issues, we first present a new real-world uod dataset called ruod that places uod in the context of general scene under-standing. the dataset contains 14,000 high-resolution images, 74,903 labeled objects, and 10 common aquatic categories. the dataset also has various marine objects and rich environmental challenges includ-ing haze-like effects, color casts, and light interference. second, we conduct extensive and systematic experiments on ruod to evaluate the development of general underwater scene detection from the per-spective of algorithms, complex marine objects, and environmental challenges. the findings from these explorations highlight the challenges of uod and suggest promising solutions and new directions for uod. finally, uod in practice typically uses underwater image enhancement during preprocessing to improve image quality. we thus characterize object detection performance on enhanced images and find an effective auxiliary framework of image enhancement for uod. our dataset is available at https://git hub.com/dlut-dimt/ruod.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0038
"visual mapless navigation (vmn), modeling a direct mapping between sensory inputs and agent actions, aims to navigate from a stochastic origin location to a prescribed goal in an unseen scene. a fundamental yet challenging issue in visual mapless navigation is generalizing to a new scene. furthermore, it is of pivotal concern to design a method to make effective policy learning. to address these issues, we introduce a novel visual mapless navigation model, which integrates hierarchical semantic information represented by context vector with meta-learning to improve the generalization performance gap between known and unknown environments. extensive experimental results on ai2-thor benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model by >15.79% for the spl and by >23.83% for the success rate. in addition, the exploration rate experiment shows that our model can effectively improve the invalid exploration behavior of the agent and accelerate the convergence speed of the model. our implementation code and data can be viewed on https://github.com/zhiyu-tech/whu-cvvmn.",AB_0038
"the designed method aims to perform image classification tasks efficiently and accurately. different from the traditional cnn-based image classification methods, which are greatly affected by the number of labels and the depth of the network. although the deep network can improve the accuracy of the model, the training process is usually time-consuming and laborious. we explained how to use only a few of labels, design a more flexible network architecture and combine feature distillation method to improve model efficiency while ensuring high accuracy. specifically, we integrate different network structures into independent individuals to make the use of network structures more flexible. based on knowledge distillation, we extract the channel features and establish a feature distillation connection from the teacher network to the student network. by comparing the experimental results with other related popular methods on commonly used data sets, the effectiveness of the method is proved. the code can be found at https://github.com/zhangxinba/semi_fd.",AB_0038
"in this paper, we propose a new non-convex regularization term named half-quadratic function to achieve robustness and sparseness for robust principal component analysis, and derive its proximity operator, in-dicating that the resultant optimization problem can be solved in computationally attractive manner. in addition, the low-rank matrix component is expressed as the factorization form and proximal block co-ordinate descent is leveraged to seek its solution, whose convergence is rigorously analyzed. we prove that any limit point of the iterations is a critical point of the objective function. furthermore, the param-eter that controls the robustness and sparseness in our algorithm, is automatically adjusted according to the statistical residual error. experimental results based on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the devised algorithm can effectively extract the low-rank and sparse components. matlab code is available at https://github.com/bestzywang .(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0038
"there is a significant challenge to discover porous materials that can effectively capture and separate co2 from natural gas, refining gas, and flue gas, which has attracted attention in dealing with climate warming and energy purification. recently, hybrid microporous materials with narrow pores and containing fluorine have been rapidly used in gas separation based on physisorption. in this contribution, molecular simulations combined with high-throughput calculations were performed to calculate structural parameters and performance evaluation metrics of 1015 promising adsorbents to rank and screen out the top candidates for co2/ch4, co2/h2 and co2/ n2 separation. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to unlock this kind of fluorinated material database in co2 separation, in which statistical information indicates that a large number of interpenetrating structures lead to 64% of ultra-microporous materials and the number of particles per unit volume of fluorine we defined also has a positive effect on the heat of adsorption of co2. the structural performance relationship re-veals a clear picture of strong co2 capture but poor energy gas (ch4 and h2) storage. the mathematical model established from the geometry and energy descriptors has a strong correlation with the mixture adsorption selectivity in co2/n2 separation, and the ideal selectivity can be applied to save computing resources in co2/h2 separation. cadmium and vanadium with high frequency may represent the new characteristics of the next generation adsorbent for capturing co2, among the 18 high-performance materials selected according to the adsorption performance score and mixture adsorption selectivity. the centroid density distribution and radial distribution function manifest that co2 is preferentially close to fluorine atoms and metal atoms. here, we established an online high-throughput calculation code (https://github.com/oddthinker/htcs) for adsorption and separation. all of this will provide guidelines for experimental synthesis and large-scale screening of target materials.",AB_0038
"most message passing neural networks (mpnns) are widely used for assortative network representation learning under the assumption of homophily between connected nodes. however, this fundamental assumption is inconsistent with the heterophily of disassortative networks (dns) in many real-world applications. therefore, we propose a novel mpnn called neda based on neighborhood expansion for disassortative network representation learning (dnrl). specifically, our neda first performs neighborhood expansion to seek more informative nodes for aggregation and then performs data augmentation to speed up the optimization process of a set of parameter matrices at the maximum available training data with minimal computational cost. to evaluate the performance of neda comprehensively, we perform several experiments on benchmark disassortative network datasets with variable sizes, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our neda model. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/xueyanfeng/neda.",AB_0038
