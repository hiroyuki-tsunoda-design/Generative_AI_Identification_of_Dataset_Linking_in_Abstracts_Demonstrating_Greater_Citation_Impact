"the doping of functionalized graphene oxide (go) in the membranes becomes a promising method for improving the performance of high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (ht-pemfc). phosphonated graphene oxide (pgo) with a p/o ratio of 8.5% was quickly synthesised by one-step elec-trochemical exfoliation based on a three-dimensiaonal (3d) printed reactor and natural graphite flakes. compared with the go prepared by the two-step electrochemical exfoliation method, the pgo synthe-sized by the one-step electrochemical exfoliation can better improve the performance of the membrane-electrode-assembly (mea) based on the polybenzimidazole (pbi) membrane in the ht-pemfc. the doping of 1.5 wt% go synthesised by electrochemical exfoliation with the 2-step method or reactor method in pbi increased the peak power density by 17.4% or 35.4% compared to mea based on pure pbi membrane at 150 degrees c, respectively. in addition, the doping of pgo in pbi improves its dura-bility under accelerated stress test (ast).(c) 2022 science press and dalian institute of chemical physics, chinese academy of sciences. published by elsevier b.v. and science press. this is an open access article under the cc by license (http://creati-vecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",AB_0047
"the evolution of any complex dynamical system is described by its state derivative operators. however, the extraction of the exact n-order state derivative operators is often inaccurate and requires approximations. the open-source cfd (computational fluid dynamics) code called broadcast discretises the compressible navier-stokes equations and then extracts the linearised n-derivative operators through algorithmic differentiation (ad) providing a toolbox for laminar flow dynamics. furthermore, the gradients through adjoint derivation are extracted either by transposition of the linearised operator or through the backward mode of the ad tool. the software includes base-flow computation and linear global stability analysis via eigen-decomposition of the linearised operator or via singular value decomposition of the resolvent operator. sensitivity tools as well as weakly nonlinear analysis complete the package. the numerical method for the spatial discretisation of the equations consists of a finite-difference high-order shock-capturing scheme applied within a finite volume framework on 2d curvilinear structured grids. the stability and sensitivity tools are demonstrated on two cases: a cylinder flow at low mach number and a hypersonic boundary layer.program summaryprogram title: broadcastcpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /hcf893cr2n .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /onerahub /broadcastlicensing provisions: mozilla public license 2.0programming language: python, fortrannature of problem: the extraction of the exact n-order state derivative operators useful to study complex dynamical systems is often inaccurate and requires approximations from the user. solution method: this program discretises the compressible navier-stokes equations and then extracts the linearised state derivative operators through algorithmic differentiation providing a toolbox for laminar flow dynamics.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0047
"information about the impact of interactions between amyloid proteins on their fibrillization propensity is scattered among many experimental articles and presented in unstructured form. we manually curated information located in almost 200 publications (selected out of 562 initially considered), obtaining details of 883 experimentally studied interactions between 46 amyloid proteins or peptides. we also proposed a novel standardized terminology for the description of amyloid-amyloid interactions, which is included in our database, covering all currently known types of such a cross-talk, including inhibition of fibrillization, cross-seeding and other phenomena. the new approach allows for more specific studies on amyloids and their interactions, by providing very well-defined data. amylograph, an online database presenting information on amyloid-amyloid interactions, is available at (http://amylograph.com/). its functionalities are also accessible as the r package (https://github.com/kotulskalab/amylograph). amylograph is the only publicly available repository for experimentally determined amyloid-amyloid interactions.",AB_0047
"spatial anxiety (i.e., feelings of apprehension and fear about navigating everyday environments) can adversely impact people's ability to reach desired locations and explore unfamiliar places. prior research has either assessed spatial anxiety as an individual-difference variable or measured it as an outcome, but there are currently no experimental inductions to investigate its causal effects. to address this lacuna, we developed a novel protocol for inducing spatial anxiety within a virtual environment. participants first learnt a route using directional arrows. next, we removed the directional arrows and randomly assigned participants to navigate either the same route (n = 22; control condition) or a variation of this route in which we surreptitiously introduced unfamiliar paths and landmarks (n = 22; spatial-anxiety condition). the manipulation successfully induced transient (i.e., state-level) spatial anxiety and task stress but did not significantly reduce task enjoyment. our findings lay the foundation for an experimental paradigm that will facilitate future work on the causal effects of spatial anxiety in navigational contexts. the experimental task is freely available via the open science framework (https://osf.io/uq4v7/).",AB_0047
"as free online encyclopedias with massive volumes of content, wikipedia and wikidata are key to many natural language processing (nlp) tasks, such as information retrieval, knowledge base building, machine translation, text classification, and text summarization. in this paper, we introduce wikides, a novel dataset to generate short descriptions of wikipedia articles for the problem of text summarization. the dataset consists of over 80k english samples on 6987 topics. we set up a two-phase summarization method - description generation (phase i) and candidate ranking (phase ii) - as a strong approach that relies on transfer and contrastive learning. for description generation, t5 and bart show their superiority compared to other small-scale pre-trained models. by applying contrastive learning with the diverse input from beam search, the metric fusion-based ranking models outperform the direct description generation models significantly up to approximate to 22 rouge in topic-exclusive split and topic-independent split. furthermore, the outcome descriptions in phase ii are supported by human evaluation in over 45.33% chosen compared to 23.66% in phase i against the gold descriptions. in the aspect of sentiment analysis, the generated descriptions cannot effectively capture all sentiment polarities from paragraphs while doing this task better from the gold descriptions. the automatic generation of new descriptions reduces the human efforts in creating them and enriches wikidata-based knowledge graphs. our paper shows a practical impact on wikipedia and wikidata since there are thousands of missing descriptions. finally, we expect wikides to be a useful dataset for related works in capturing salient information from short paragraphs. the curated dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/wikides.",AB_0047
"in recent years, it has become increasingly common for high performance computers (hpc) to possess some level of heterogeneous architecture -typically in the form of gpu accelerators. in some machines these are isolated within a dedicated partition, whilst in others they are integral to all compute nodes -often with multiple gpus per node -and provide the majority of a machine's compute performance. in light of this trend, it is becoming essential that codes deployed on hpc are updated to execute on accelerator hardware. in this paper we introduce a gpu implementation of the 3d blood flow simulation code hemelb that has been developed using cuda c++. we demonstrate how taking advantage of nvidia gpu hardware can achieve significant performance improvements compared to the equivalent cpu only code on which it has been built whilst retaining the excellent strong scaling characteristics that have been repeatedly demonstrated by the cpu version. with hpc positioned on the brink of the exascale era, we use hemelb as a motivation to provide a discussion on some of the challenges that many users will face when deploying their own applications on upcoming exascale machines.program summary program title: hemelb (hemepure_gpu)cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /jhdv4drxbx .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /ucl-ccs /hemepure -gpulicensing provisions: lgplv3programming language: cuda c++nature of problem: the geometric characteristics of arteries and veins throughout the human body can vary considerably between individuals. this is particularly true for patients with cardiovascular disease. accurately resolving the dynamics of blood flow within such domains requires a three-dimensional technique that can replicate such variations at high fidelity. the study of full human-scale domains for physiologically relevant timeframes further demands a tool that can be executed efficiently on the advancing technological frameworks available on modern high performance computers.solution method: hemelb uses the lattice boltzmann method [1,2,3,4] to simulate blood flow in complex, three-dimensional sparse vasculatures. a single relaxation time approximation is used [5]. solid boundaries are modelled using simple bounce-back boundary conditions [6]. blood flow is driven by applying either velocity or pressure boundary conditions [7]. the localised solution kernels of the algorithm allow for efficient parallelisation of the method to very high core counts. this version of hemelb outlines the conversion of the code to allow execution on nvidia gpus, currently the most widely used architecture in ultra high performance computers, whilst retaining its capacity for strong scaling to very large core counts.references[1] s. succi, the lattice boltzmann equation: for fluid dynamics and beyond, oxford university press, 2001.[2] a.a. mohamad, lattice boltzmann method: fundamentals and engineering applications with computer codes, springer london, 2011.

"experimental design and computational modelling across the cognitive sciences often rely on measures of semantic similarity between concepts. traditional measures of semantic similarity are typically derived from distance in taxonomic databases (e.g. wordnet), databases of participant-produced semantic features, or corpus-derived linguistic distributional similarity (e.g. cbow), all of which are theoretically problematic in their lack of grounding in sensorimotor experience. we present a new measure of sensorimotor distance between concepts, based on multidimensional comparisons of their experiential strength across 11 perceptual and action-effector dimensions in the lancaster sensorimotor norms. we demonstrate that, in modelling human similarity judgements, sensorimotor distance has comparable explanatory power to other measures of semantic similarity, explains variance in human judgements which is missed by other measures, and does so with the advantages of remaining both grounded and computationally efficient. moreover, sensorimotor distance is equally effective for both concrete and abstract concepts. we further introduce a web-based tool (https://lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/smdistance) for easily calculating and visualising sensorimotor distance between words, featuring coverage of nearly 800 million word pairs. supplementary materials are available at https://osf.io/d42q6/.",AB_0047

"testing that an experiment works as intended is critical for identifying design problems and catching technical errors that could invalidate the results. testing is also time-consuming because of the need to manually run the experiment. this makes testing the experiment costly for researchers, and therefore testing is less comprehensive than in other kinds of software development where tools to automate and speed up the testing process are widely used. in this paper, we describe an approach that substantially reduces the time required to test behavioral experiments: automated simulation of participant behavior. we describe how software that is used to build experiments can use information contained in the experiment's code to automatically generate plausible participant behavior. we demonstrate this through an implementation using jspsych. we then describe four potential scenarios where automated simulation of participant behavior can improve the way researchers build experiments. each scenario includes a demo and accompanying code. the full set of examples can be found at https://jspsych.github.io/simulation-examples/.",AB_0047
"we present a database of category production (aka semantic fluency) norms collected in the uk for 117 categories (67 concrete and 50 abstract). participants verbally named as many category members as possible within 60 seconds, resulting in a large variety of over 2000 generated member concepts. the norms feature common measures of category production (production frequency, mean ordinal rank, first-rank frequency), as well as response times for all first-named category members, and typicality ratings collected from a separate participant sample. we provide two versions of the dataset: a referential version that groups together responses that relate to the same referent (e.g., hippo, hippopotamus) and a full version that retains all original responses to enable future lexical analysis. correlational analyses with previous norms from the usa and uk demonstrate both consistencies and differences in english-language norms over time and between geographical regions. further exploration of the norms reveals a number of structural and psycholinguistic differences between abstract and concrete categories. the data and analyses will be of use in the fields of cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, psycholinguistics, and cognitive modelling, and to any researchers interested in semantic category structure. all data, including original participant recordings, are available at https://osf.io/jgcu6/.",AB_0047
