"seeking feature correspondences among two or more images is an important problem in computer vision and image processing. the putative matches constructed by the similarity of feature descriptors are often contaminated by many false matches. typically, the local neighborhood points of a true match point have a rank order, which will be maintained in the corresponding image, and we call it rank consistency. in this paper, we design a number of sorting plans to obtain the neighborhood rank lists by taking full advantage of the local neighborhood geometry structure. in order to measure the differences between rank lists, we adopt the statistically famous kendall rank correlation coefficient and generalize its definition for matching problem. we design a neighborhood common element guidance strategy and a multi-neighborhood strategy to improve the universality and robustness of our method. our method has linear complexity and it has superiority over state-of-the-art methods on several challenging data sets. it also performs well in image registration and loop-closure detection tasks. the source code of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/mnyangs/mgkrcc.",AB_0301
"increasing evidence has shown that the expression of circular rnas (circrnas) can affect the drug sensitivity of cells and significantly influence drug efficacy. therefore, research into the relationships between circrnas and drugs can be of great significance in increasing the comprehension of circrnas function, as well as contributing to the discovery of new drugs and the repurposing of existing drugs. however, it is time-consuming and costly to validate the function of circrna with traditional medical research methods. therefore, the development of efficient and accurate computational models that can assist in discovering the potential interactions between circrnas and drugs is urgently needed. in this study, a novel method is proposed, called dhanmkf , that aims to predict potential circrna-drug sensitivity interactions for further biomedical screening and validation. firstly, multimodal networks were constructed by dhanmkf using multiple sources of information on circrnas and drugs. secondly, comprehensive intra-type and inter-type node representations were learned using bi-typed multi-relational heterogeneous graphs, which are attention-based encoders utilizing a hierarchical process. thirdly, the multi-kernel fusion method was used to fuse intra-type embedding and inter-type embedding. finally, the dual laplacian regularized least squares method (dlaprls) was used to predict the potential circrna-drug sensitivity associations using the combined kernel in circrna and drug spaces. compared with the other methods, dhanmkf obtained the highest auc value on two datasets. code is available at https://github.com/cuntjx/dhanmkf.",AB_0301
"background: clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc) stands as the prevailing variant kidney cancer in humans. unfortunately, patients with disseminated rcc at diagnosis often have a diminished prognosis. rapid tumor growth necessitates efficient blood supply for oxygen and nutrients, involving the circulation of blood from vessels to tumor tissues, facilitating tumor cell entry into the extracellular matrix. vasculogenic mimicry (vm) significantly contributes to tumor growth and metastasis. within this investigation, we identified vasculogenic mimicry-related genes (vmrgs) by analyzing data from 607 cases of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (kirc) in the cancer genome atlas (tcga) and the gene expression omnibus (geo) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). these findings offer insights into ccrcc progression and metastasis.method: we identified vmrgs-related subtypes using consistent clustering methods. the signature of the vmrgs was created using univariate cox regression and lasso cox regression analyses. to evaluate differences in immune cell infiltration, we employed ssgsea. afterwards, we created an innovative risk assessment model, known as the vm index, along with a nomogram to forecast the prognosis of ccrcc. additionally, we verified the expression of an important gene related to vm, peroxiredoxin 2 (prdx2), in tissue samples. furthermore, we assessed the sensitivity to drugs in various groups by utilizing the prrophetic r package.results: significant predictors of survival rates in both high- and low-risk groups of kirc patients were identified as vmrgs. the independent prognostic factors for rcc were confirmed by both univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses, validating vmrg risk signatures. differences were observed in drug sensitivity, immune checkpoint expression, and responses to immune therapy between patients classified into high- and low-vmrg-risk groups. our nomograms consistently demonstrated precise predictive capabilities. finally, we experimentally verified prdx2 expression levels and their impact on prognosis.conclusion: the signature predicts patient prognosis and therapy response, laying the groundwork for future clinical strategies in treating ccrcc patients.",AB_0301
"purpose: hsk16149 is a novel, potent gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) analog for the treatment of neuropathic pain. this study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of hsk16149 after single and multiple doses in healthy chinese subjects.methods: the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comprised two parts: sad (single ascending-dose study) and mad (multiple ascending-dose study). a total of 122 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. hsk16149 capsule or placebo was administered as the protocol required. the safety of the drug was evaluated through clinical examinations and adverse events. blood and urine samples were collected at the designated time intervals for pharmacokinetic analysis.results: subjects were generally well tolerated after hsk16149 administration and the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (teaes) was dizziness, which was expected based on the mechanism of action of hsk16149. in sad, auc and cmax were shown to have a dose-proportional relationship in the dose range of 5-120 mg. the t1/2 of hsk16149 is 3.7-6.4 h. in mad, after a single and multiple administration of 15-80 mg, auc and cmax are proportional to the increased dose of hsk16149, and the accumulative ratios of auc and cmax at steady-state were 1.05-1.44 and 1.07-1.36, respectively, indicating that hsk16149 only accumulated slightly after repeated administration.conclusion: hsk16149 was well tolerated in healthy chinese subjects. based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data, 80 mg twice daily (bid) was suggested as the highest target dose for further clinical development.clinical trial registration: http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn, identifier ctr20182535 and ctr20191317",AB_0301
"backgroundlysine glutarylation (kglu) is one of the most important post-translational modifications (ptms), which plays significant roles in various cellular functions, including metabolism, mitochondrial processes, and translation. therefore, accurate identification of the kglu site is important for elucidating protein molecular function. due to the time-consuming and expensive limitations of traditional biological experiments, computational-based kglu site prediction research is gaining more and more attention.resultsin this paper, we proposed gbdt_kglusite, a novel kglu site prediction model based on gbdt and appropriate feature combinations, which achieved satisfactory performance. specifically, seven features including sequence-based features, physicochemical property-based features, structural-based features, and evolutionary-derived features were used to characterize proteins. nearmiss-3 and elastic net were applied to address data imbalance and feature redundancy issues, respectively. the experimental results show that gbdt_kglusite has good robustness and generalization ability, with accuracy and auc values of 93.73%, and 98.14% on five-fold cross-validation as well as 90.11%, and 96.75% on the independent test dataset, respectively.conclusiongbdt_kglusite is an effective computational method for identifying kglu sites in protein sequences. it has good stability and generalization ability and could be useful for the identification of new kglu sites in the future. the relevant code and dataset are available at https://github.com/flyinsky6/gbdt_kglusite.",AB_0301
"current predictors of dna-binding residues (dbrs) from protein sequences belong to two distinct groups, those trained on binding annotations extracted from structured protein-dna complexes (structure-trained) vs. intrinsically disordered proteins (disorder-trained). we complete the first empirical analysis of predictive performance across the structure- and disorder-annotated proteins for a representative collection of ten predictors. majority of the structure-trained tools perform well on the structure-annotated proteins while doing relatively poorly on the disorder-annotated proteins, and vice versa. several methods make accurate predictions for the structure-annotated proteins or the disorder-annotated proteins, but none performs highly accurately for both annotation types. moreover, most predictors make excessive cross-predictions for the disorder-annotated proteins, where residues that interact with non-dna ligand types are predicted as dbrs. motivated by these results, we design, validate and deploy an innovative meta-model, hybriddbrpred, that uses deep transformer network to combine predictions generated by three best current predictors. hybriddbrpred provides accurate predictions and low levels of cross-predictions across the two annotation types, and is statistically more accurate than each of the ten tools and baseline meta-predictors that rely on averaging and logistic regression. we deploy hybriddbrpred as a convenient web server at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/hybriddbrpred/ and provide the corresponding source code at https://github.com/jianzhang-xynu/hybriddbrpred.",AB_0301
"remote sensing scene classification is the basis of advanced smart urban planning tasks such as urban functional zone division and land use type identification. in recent years, a wide range of emerging data sources is receiving progressive attention for urban features extraction, such as satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs), and ground sensors. how to effectively utilize these multi-view data jointly to improve scene classification performance has become a hot topic of remote sensing challenge. existing feature fusion methods tend to map data from different views into a common feature space, which is often difficult to find when the data between views differ greatly. furthermore, because these methods require data from all views as input, they are not flexible enough to handle situations where there is only one view input when inferring. to address the aforementioned issues, a novel coupled parallel architecture (cpa) using weighted collaboration fusion constrained by consistency between views (cbv-wcf) is proposed in this paper. in the training phase, the cbv module reduces the impact of the heterogeneous gap across views by capturing the consistency information between views. well the wcf module is used to fully mine and effectively fuse the complementary information between views to improve the performance of downstream tasks. in the inference phase, the proposed architecture can effectively improve the classification performance in both cases of multi-view and single-view input. our method is evaluated on air-ground dual-view scene classification, which is a typical multi-view task with large image differences between views. experimental results on two publicly available air-ground dual-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves classification performance while bringing some inspiration and new solutions to multi-view tasks. the code of this paper will be published at: https://github.com/forest-repo/cbv-wcf.",AB_0301
"the wide application of deep neural networks (dnns) demands an increasing amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a dnn resists black-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (sqas) are the most threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with only access to model outputs. defending against sqas requires a slight but artful variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same output information with sqas. in this article, we propose a real-world defense by unifying gradients (unig) of different data so that sqas could only probe a much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. since such universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the input-specific perturbations, unig protects real-world dnns by indicating to attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. we implement unig efficiently by a hadamard product module, which is plug-and-play. according to extensive experiments on 5 sqas, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines, unig significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean accuracy on cifar10 and imagenet. for instance, unig maintains a model of 77.80% accuracy under a 2500-query square attack while the state-of-the-art adversarially trained model only has 67.34% on cifar10. simultaneously, unig outperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the smallest modification of the model output. the code is released at https://github.com/snowien/unig-pytorch.",AB_0301
"entity set expansion (ese) is a valuable task that aims to find entities of the target semantic class described by given seed entities. various natural language processing (nlp) and information retrieval (ir) downstream applications have benefited from ese due to its ability to discover knowledge. although existing corpus-based ese methods have achieved great progress, they still rely on corpora with high-quality entity information annotated, because most of them need to obtain the context patterns through the position of the entity in a sentence. therefore, the quality of the given corpora and their entity annotation has become the bottleneck that limits the performance of such methods. to overcome this dilemma and make the ese models free from the dependence on entity annotation, our work aims to explore a new ese paradigm, namely corpus-independent ese. specifically, we devise a context pattern generation module that utilizes autoregressive language models (e.g., gpt-2) to automatically generate high-quality context patterns for entities. in addition, we propose the gapa, a novel ese framework that leverages the aforementioned generated patterns to expand target entities. extensive experiments and detailed analyses on three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. all the codes of our experiments are available at https://github.com/geekjuruo/gapa.",AB_0301
"unsupervised bipartite graph learning has been a hot topic in multi-view clustering, to tackle the restricted scalability issue of traditional full graph clustering in large-scale applications. however, the existing bipartite graph clustering paradigm pays little attention to the adverse impact of noisy features on learning process. to further facilitate this part of research, apart from simply reweighting features to depress the noisy ones, we take the first step towards analyzing the induced adverse impact via theoretical and experimental investigations. one crucial finding in this article is that the existence of noisy features will incur anchor shift phenomenon, which deviates from the potential representations of anchors and then degrades performance. to this end, we propose a coupled noisy feature filter mechanism with automatically finding feature importance to remedy the anchor shift issue in this article. apart from leveraging features, we theoretically analyze the bounds of proposed feature-adaptive bipartite graph's fuzzy membership. specifically, distinguishing features' discrimination will increase the fuzzy membership to achieve soft partitions against the potential inaccurate absolute relationships. with the afore-mentioned merits, our proposed multi-view bipartite graph clustering with coupled noisy feature filter model (mvbgc-nff) provides novel and interesting insights on the feature level of anchor shift. the effectiveness and efficiency of mvbgc-nff are demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets with improved clustering performance, increasing fuzzy membership, and filtering noisy features. the code is available on https://github.com/liliangnudt/mvbgc-nff.",AB_0301
