"cctv camera calibration and geolocalization are essential for the deployment of smart-city applications. despite the pressing need for practical and accurate surveillance camera calibration, most existing techniques are cumbersome and rely on restrictive assumptions on the camera's or the scene's geometry. in this context, we propose cctv-calib, a light and user-friendly toolbox to calibrate traffic cameras using satellite views. unlike other surveillance camera calibration techniques, cctv-calib can estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters as well as the gps location of one or multiple cctv cameras in a few clicks. for this purpose, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage pipeline to ensure a robust, repeatable, and easy calibration process. in the first stage, we perform automated keypoint matching between the cctv image and the satellite views to compute an initial estimation of the camera's parameters. in the second stage, this rough initialization guides a fine matching strategy, further improving calibration accuracy. this novel calibration pipeline is integrated into an easy-to-use gui, making traffic camera calibration accessible to non-computer vision experts. to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and relevance of our technique, we propose a novel dataset composed of synthetic and real images captured around the globe. finally, in order to illustrate the pertinence of our calibration strategy, we demonstrate its applicability to 3d vehicle geolocalization. we made this toolbox and datasets freely available: https://github.com/rameau-fr/cctv-calib.",AB_0079
"background radical surgery is the standard treatment for rectal cancer, but can impact quality of life. recently, the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy with a watch-and-wait strategy has been proposed in which patients with a ccr after total neoadjuvant therapy do not proceed to surgery. however, most investigations of a watch-and-wait strategy have reported cases where ccr was achieved coincidentally via total neoadjuvant therapy. the aim is to assess whether total neoadjuvant therapy is effective in early-stage rectal cancer in patients that achieve ccr and are offered a watch-and-wait strategy.methods jcog2010 (toward) is a multi-institutional, single-arm phase ii/iii confirmatory investigation of the safety and efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy followed by a watch-and-wait strategy for rectal cancer. key eligibility criteria include ct2-3 n0 m0 rectal adenocarcinoma, tumour diameter less than or equal to 5 cm, age 18-75 years, performance status 0-1, and no history of pelvic irradiation or rectal surgery. total neoadjuvant therapy involves neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (capecitabine and radiotherapy: 45 gy/25 fractions to the whole pelvis plus boost of 5.4 gy/3 fractions to the primary tumour) followed by consolidation chemotherapy (four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin). patients will be re-staged every 8 weeks after total neoadjuvant therapy, and those who achieve ccr will undergo a watch-and-wait strategy, those with near complete response will undergo a watch-and-wait strategy or local resection, and those with an incomplete response will undergo radical surgery. the primary endpoint is the ccr rate in phase ii and 5-year overall survival in phase iii. secondary endpoints include postoperative anal, urinary, and sexual function. a total of 105 patients (phase ii, 40 patients; phase iii, 65 patients) will be enrolled over 3.5 years.conclusion this trial will determine whether total neoadjuvant therapy and a watch-and-wait strategy is an effective alternative to radical surgery for early-stage rectal cancer in patients with ct2-3 n0 m0 and tumour size less than or equal to 5 cm.registration number jrcts031220288 (https://jrct.niph.go.jp/en-latest-detail/jrcts031220288). the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy with a watch-and-wait strategy has been put forward in recent years, in which surgery is not required in patients who have a ccr after total neoadjuvant therapy. however, patients who are suitable for a watch-and-wait strategy and the ccr rate achieved by total neoadjuvant therapy remain to be determined. therefore, jcog2010 was initiated, a multi-institutional, single-arm phase ii/iii trial that is designed to confirm that total neoadjuvant therapy followed by a watch-and-wait strategy is non-inferior to the standard therapy of surgical resection for rectal cancer.",AB_0079

"motivation the rapid and extensive transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has led to an unprecedented global health emergency, affecting millions of people and causing an immense socioeconomic impact. the identification of sars-cov-2 phosphorylation sites plays an important role in unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms behind infection and the resulting alterations in host cell pathways. however, currently available prediction tools for identifying these sites lack accuracy and efficiency.results in this study, we presented a comprehensive biological function analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in a clonal human lung epithelial a549 cell, revealing dramatic changes in protein phosphorylation pathways in host cells. moreover, a novel deep learning predictor called pspred-ale is specifically designed to identify phosphorylation sites in human host cells that are infected with sars-cov-2. the key idea of pspred-ale lies in the use of a self-adaptive learning embedding algorithm, which enables the automatic extraction of context sequential features from protein sequences. in addition, the tool uses multihead attention module that enables the capturing of global information, further improving the accuracy of predictions. comparative analysis of features demonstrated that the self-adaptive learning embedding features are superior to hand-crafted statistical features in capturing discriminative sequence information. benchmarking comparison shows that pspred-ale outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction tools and achieves robust performance. therefore, the proposed model can effectively identify phosphorylation sites assistant the biomedical scientists in understanding the mechanism of phosphorylation in sars-cov-2 infection.availability and implementation pspred-ale is available at https://github.com/jiaoshihu/pspred-ale and zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8330277).",AB_0079
"background: many studies have reported a correlation between lymph node metastasis and prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer. however, the clinical significance of enlarged lymph nodes for prognosis has scarcely been explored. objective: this study aimed to assess the clinical significance of enlarged lymph nodes in stage ii colorectal cancer. design: this is a multicenter retrospective observational study with a median follow-up period of 66.8 months. settings: patients' medical records were retrospectively collected from the japanese study group for postoperative follow-up of colorectal cancer database. patients: this study included 2212 patients with stage ii colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between january 2009 and december 2012. patients were classified into the enlarged lymph node and nonenlarged lymph node groups and their data were compared. main outcome measures: clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses of the 2 groups were compared. the main outcomes measured were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. results: the enlarged lymph node group showed significantly better overall survival and recurrence-free survival in pt4b cases but not in pt3 or pt4a cases. in pt4b cases, an enlarged lymph node (hr, 0.53; 95% ci, 0.29-0.98) was an independent prognostic factor for longer recurrence-free survival, whereas a rectal lesion (hr, 3.46; 95% ci, 1.90-6.29) was an independent prognostic factor for shorter recurrence-free survival. an enlarged lymph node was associated with a lower distant recurrence rate (hr, 0.49; 95% ci, 0.26-0.92) and a tendency to correlate with better overall survival (hr, 0.50; 95% ci, 0.22-1.14). limitations: the retrospective design may have increased the risk of selection bias. inadequate information regarding enlarged lymph nodes is another study limitation. conclusions: this study showed that enlarged lymph nodes are associated with a favorable prognosis in patients with pt4b stage ii colorectal cancer. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c246.",AB_0079
"background improvement in survival in patients with advanced cancer is accompanied by an increased probability of bone metastasis and related pathologic fractures (especially in the proximal femur). the few systems proposed and used to diagnose impending fractures owing to metastasis and to ultimately prevent future fractures have practical limitations; thus, novel screening tools are essential. a ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis is a standard modality for staging and follow-up in patients with cancer, and radiologic assessments of the proximal femur are possible with ct-based digitally reconstructed radiographs. deep-learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (cnns), may be able to predict pathologic fractures from digitally reconstructed radiographs, but to our knowledge, they have not been tested for this application.questions/purposes (1) how accurate is a cnn model for predicting a pathologic fracture in a proximal femur with metastasis using digitally reconstructed radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis ct images in patients with advanced cancer? (2) do cnn models perform better than clinicians with varying backgrounds and experience levels in predicting a pathologic fracture on abdomen and pelvis ct images without any knowledge of the patients' histories, except for metastasis in the proximal femur?methods a total of 392 patients received radiation treatment of the proximal femur at three hospitals from january 2011 to december 2021. the patients had 2945 ct scans of the abdomen and pelvis for systemic evaluation and follow-up in relation to their primary cancer. in 33% of the ct scans (974), it was impossible to identify whether a pathologic fracture developed within 3 months after each ct image was acquired, and these were excluded. finally, 1971 cases with a mean age of 59 +/- 12 years were included in this study. pathologic fractures developed within 3 months after ct in 3% (60 of 1971) of cases. a total of 47% (936 of 1971) were women. sixty cases had an established pathologic fracture within 3 months after each ct scan, and another group of 1911 cases had no established pathologic fracture within 3 months after ct scan. the mean age of the cases in the former and latter groups was 64 +/- 11 years and 59 +/- 12 years, respectively, and 32% (19 of 60) and 53% (1016 of 1911) of cases, respectively, were female. digitally reconstructed radiographs were generated with perspective projections of three-dimensional ct volumes onto two-dimensional planes. then, 1557 images from one hospital were used for a training set. to verify that the deep-learning models could consistently operate even in hospitals with a different medical environment, 414 images from other hospitals were used for external validation. the number of images in the groups with and without a pathologic fracture within 3 months after each ct scan increased from 1911 to 22,932 and from 60 to 720, respectively, using data augmentation methods that are known to be an effective way to boost the performance of deep-learning models. three cnns (vgg16, resnet50, and densenet121) were fine-tuned using digitally reconstructed radiographs. for performance measures, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and f1 score were determined. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate three cnn models mainly, and the optimal accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated using the youden j statistic. accuracy refers to the proportion of fractures in the groups with and without a pathologic fracture within 3 months after each ct scan that were accurately predicted by the cnn model. sensitivity and specificity represent the proportion of accurately predicted fractures among those with and without a pathologic fracture within 3 months after each ct scan, respectively. precision is a measure of how few false-positives the model produces. the f1 score is a harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision, which have a tradeoff relationship. gradient-weighted class activation mapping images were created to check whether the cnn model correctly focused on potential pathologic fracture regions. the cnn model with the best performance was compared with the performance of clinicians.results densenet121 showed the best performance in identifying pathologic fractures; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for densenet121 was larger than those for vgg16 (0.77 +/- 0.07 [95% ci 0.75 to 0.79] versus 0.71 +/- 0.08 [95% ci 0.69 to 0.73]; p = 0.001) and resnet50 (0.77 +/- 0.07 [95% ci 0.75 to 0.79] versus 0.72 +/- 0.09 [95% ci 0.69 to 0.74]; p = 0.001). specifically, densenet121 scored the highest in sensitivity (0.22 +/- 0.07 [95% ci 0.20 to 0.24]), precision (0.72 +/- 0.19 [95% ci 0.67 to 0.77]), and f1 score (0.34 +/- 0.10 [95% ci 0.31 to 0.37]), and it focused accurately on the region with the expected pathologic fracture. further, densenet121 was less likely than clinicians to mispredict cases in which there was no pathologic fracture than cases in which there was a fracture; the performance of densenet121 was better than clinician performance in terms of specificity (0.98 +/- 0.01 [95% ci 0.98 to 0.99] versus 0.86 +/- 0.09 [95% ci 0.81 to 0.91]; p = 0.01), precision (0.72 +/- 0.19 [95% ci 0.67 to 0.77] versus 0.11 +/- 0.10 [95% ci 0.05 to 0.17]; p = 0.0001), and f1 score (0.34 +/- 0.10 [95% ci 0.31 to 0.37] versus 0.17 +/- 0.15 [95% ci 0.08 to 0.26]; p = 0.0001).conclusion cnn models may be able to accurately predict impending pathologic fractures from digitally reconstructed radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis ct images that clinicians may not anticipate; this can assist medical, radiation, and orthopaedic oncologists clinically. to achieve better performance, ensemble-learning models using knowledge of the patients' histories should be developed and validated. the code for our model is publicly available online at https://github.com/taehoonko/cnn_path_fx_prediction.level of evidence level iii, diagnostic study.",AB_0079
"background: the tumor-stroma ratio and intratumor stromal heterogeneity have been identified as prognostic factors for several carcinomas. recent advancements in image analysis technologies and their application to medicine have enabled detailed analysis of clinical data beyond human cognition. objective: this study aimed to investigate the tumor-stroma ratio and intratumor stromal heterogeneity measured using a novel objective and semiautomatic method with image analysis. design: a retrospective cohort design. settings: single institution. patients: this study included patients who underwent curative colectomy for colon cancer. main outcome measures: the survival analyses between tumor-stroma ratio or intratumor stromal heterogeneity high and low groups after colectomy were assessed in multivariate analyses. results: two hundred patients were divided into 2 groups based on the median tumor-stroma ratio and intratumor stromal heterogeneity values. the 5-year overall survival and relapse-free survival rates after colectomy significantly differed between the high and low tumor-stroma ratio or intratumor stromal heterogeneity groups. multivariate analysis identified low tumor-stroma ratio (hr: 1.90, p = 0.03) and high intratumor stromal heterogeneity (hr: 2.44, p = 0.002) as independent poor prognostic factors for relapse-free survival. the tumor-stroma ratio and intratumor stromal heterogeneity correlated with the duration from curative surgery to recurrence. furthermore, postoperative recurrence within 2 years was predicted with higher accuracy by using the tumor-stroma ratio or intratumor stromal heterogeneity than by using the pathological stage. in a validation cohort, interobserver agreement was assessed by 2 observers, and cohen's kappa coefficient for the tumor-stroma ratio (kappa value: 0.70) and intratumor stromal heterogeneity (kappa value: 0.60) revealed a substantial interobserver agreement. limitations: this study was limited by its retrospective, single-institution design. conclusions: tumor-stroma ratio and intratumor stromal heterogeneity calculated using image analysis software have potential as imaging biomarkers for predicting the survival of patients with colon cancer after colectomy. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c114.",AB_0079

"motivation in recent years, pre-training with the transformer architecture has gained significant attention. while this approach has led to notable performance improvements across a variety of downstream tasks, the underlying mechanisms by which pre-training models influence these tasks, particularly in the context of biological data, are not yet fully elucidated.results in this study, focusing on the pre-training on nucleotide sequences, we decompose a pre-training model of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (bert) into its embedding and encoding modules to analyze what a pre-trained model learns from nucleotide sequences. through a comparative study of non-standard pre-training at both the data and model levels, we find that a typical bert model learns to capture overlapping-consistent k-mer embeddings for its token representation within its embedding module. interestingly, using the k-mer embeddings pre-trained on random data can yield similar performance in downstream tasks, when compared with those using the k-mer embeddings pre-trained on real biological sequences. we further compare the learned k-mer embeddings with other established k-mer representations in downstream tasks of sequence-based functional prediction. our experimental results demonstrate that the dense representation of k-mers learned from pre-training can be used as a viable alternative to one-hot encoding for representing nucleotide sequences. furthermore, integrating the pre-trained k-mer embeddings with simpler models can achieve competitive performance in two typical downstream tasks.availability and implementation the source code and associated data can be accessed at https://github.com/yaozhong/bert_investigation.",AB_0079
