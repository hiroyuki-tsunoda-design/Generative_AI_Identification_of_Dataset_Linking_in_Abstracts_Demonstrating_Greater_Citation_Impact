"all-round visual monitoring of conveyor belt running status is an important component of the belt conveyor operation and maintenance system. intelligent analysis methods will help improve the detection in real-time and effectiveness and help make reasonable decisions. aiming at the current situation that the existing technology cannot achieve integrated detection, this paper proposes a new conveyor belt running status monitoring paradigm based on deep learning for the first time. by grafting the segmentation network into the target detection network yolov5, the integrated detection of various tasks, including fuzzy load measurement, deviation status detection, large foreign objects, and belt damage detection, etc., is realized in a real sense. experiments show that the proposed method balances detection accuracy and speed well, with a detection accuracy of up to 97%, a segmentation accuracy of up to 100%, and a detection speed of up to 90 frames per second (fps). the proposed integrated detection work is of great significance for improving the intelligent analysis capability of the operation and maintenance system, thereby ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the transportation system. our source dataset is available at https://github.com/zhangzhangzhang1618/dataset_for_belt_conveyor/tree/ma ster.",AB_0183
"noncoding rna (ncrna) is a functional rna derived from dna transcription, and most transcribed genes are transcribed into ncrna. ncrna is not directly involved in the translation of proteins, but it can participate in gene expression in cells and affect protein synthesis, thus playing an important role in biological processes such as growth, proliferation, metabolism, and information transmission. therefore, understanding the interaction between ncrna and protein is the basis for studying ncrna regulation of protein-related biological activities. however, it is very expensive and time-consuming to verify ncrna-protein interaction through biological experiments, and prediction methods based on machine learning have been developed rapidly. recently, the graph neural network model (gnn) stands out for its excellent performance, but lacks a general framework for predicting ncrna-protein interactions. we propose a gnn-based framework to predict ncrna-protein interactions, which can utilize topological structure information to complete prediction tasks faster and more accurately. meanwhile, for some smaller datasets, many ncrna nodes lack neighbor information, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. for some larger datasets, the long-tail distribution causes the prediction of the tail nodes (sparse nodes linking few neighbors) to be affected. therefore, we propose a new sampling method named headtailtransfer to mitigate these effects. experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of this method. especially for task-specific prediction on the rpi369 dataset in the graphsage-based neural network framework, the auc and acc values increased from 56.8% and 52.2% to 80.2% and 71.8%, respectively. our data and codes are available: https://github.com/kkkayle/headtailtransfer.",AB_0183
"structural magnetic resonance imaging (smri) is a popular technique that is widely applied in alzheimer's disease (ad) diagnosis. however, only a few structural atrophy areas in smri scans are highly associated with ad. the degree of atrophy in patients' brain tissues and the distribution of lesion areas differ among patients. therefore, a key challenge in smri-based ad diagnosis is identifying discriminating atrophy features. hence, we propose a multiplane and multiscale feature-level fusion attention (mps-ffa) model. the model has three components, (1) a feature encoder uses a multiscale feature extractor with hybrid attention layers to simultaneously capture and fuse multiple pathological features in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. (2) a global attention classifier combines clinical scores and two global attention layers to evaluate the feature impact scores and balance the relative contributions of different feature blocks. (3) a feature similarity discriminator minimizes the feature similarities among heterogeneous labels to enhance the ability of the network to discriminate atrophy features. the mps-ffa model provides improved interpretability for identifying discriminating features using feature visualization. the experimental results on the baseline smri scans from two databases confirm the effectiveness (e.g., accuracy and generalizability) of our method in locating pathological locations. the source code is available at https://github.com/liufei-ahu/mpsffa.",AB_0183
"background: previous studies found an association between self-reported sleep duration and mortality. this study aimed to compare the effects of objective and self-reported sleep duration on all-cause and cardiovascular disease (cvd) mortality. methods and results: a total of 2341 men and 2686 women (aged 63.9 +/- 11.1 years) were selected from the shhs (sleep heart health study). objective sleep duration was acquired using in-home polysomnography records, and self-reported sleep duration on weekdays and weekends was based on a sleep habits questionnaire. the sleep duration was categorized as <= 4 hours, 4 to 5 hours, 5 to 6 hours, 6 to 7 hours, 7 to 8 hours, and >8 hours. multivariable cox regression analysis was used to investigate the association of objective and self-reported sleep duration with all-cause and cvd mortality. during a mean follow-up period of 11 years, 1172 (23.3%) participants died, including 359 (7.1%) deaths from cvd. all-cause and cvd mortality rates decreased gradually with increasing objective sleep duration. in multivariable cox regression analysis, the greatest association for all-cause and cvd mortality was with an objective sleep duration of 5 hours or shorter. in addition, we found a j-shaped association of self-reported sleep duration on both weekdays and weekends with all-cause and cvd mortality. self-reported short (<= 4 hours) and long (> 8 hours) sleep duration on weekdays and weekends were associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cvd mortality compared with 7 to 8 hours sleep duration. furthermore, a weak correlation was observed between objective and self-reported sleep duration. conclusions: this study showed that both objective and self-reported sleep duration were associated with all-cause and cvd mortality, but with different characteristics. registration: url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct00005275; unique identifier: nct00005275.",AB_0183
"session-based recommendation focuses on predicting the next item that an anonymous user is most likely to click. due to its privacy-protecting ability, it is receiving increasing attention from researchers in recent years. the existing studies typically focus on sequence or graph structure learning. however, they ignore the consistency and sequential dependence relationships that are widely existed between items in real -world scenarios. to address this problem, we present a novel method named hypers2rec. specifically, we propose to learn two kinds of item embeddings with hypergraph convolutional network and gated recurrent unit, respectively, to account for both consistency-awareness and sequential dependence-awareness. then the attention mechanism is designed to flexibly combine the above both embeddings. finally, the reversed position and the soft attention mechanism are utilized to obtain session representations. to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hypers2rec, we conduct experiments on three real-world datasets. the results prove that the proposed hypers2rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. the source code of our proposed model is available at https://github.com/zzy-graphmininglab/hypers2rec.",AB_0183
"currently, the sparsity of user-item interaction data limits the performance of recommender systems. to alleviate the problems caused by data sparsity, researchers are devoted to designing more powerful graph neural network models to fuse the auxiliary information of users and items (social relationships, item dependencies, etc.). however, the lack of in-depth exploration of auxiliary information and the lack of optimization of the spatially distributed properties of the generated representations (known as embeddings) make it difficult to further improve the recommendation performance of these models. to address the above challenges, we propose a meta-relation-assisted knowledge-aware coupled graph neural network (mkcgn). specifically, we design meta-relationship-guided graph neural networks for capturing collaborative signals from user and item domains and introduce coupled graph neural networks to inject local relationships into user/item representations. in addition, we design an auxiliary task that optimizes the distribution properties (alignment and uniformity) of the representation on the unit hypersphere to improve the quality of the representation. to evaluate the performance of mkcgn, we compare it with the state-of-the-art model on two real-world datasets with average performance improvements of 5.26% and 4.87%(using hr@n and ndcg@n as evaluation metrics), respectively. our implemented model is available via https://github.com/ganoder/ mkcgn.",AB_0183
"distracted driver classification () plays an important role in ensuring driving safety. although many datasets are introduced to support the study of, most of them are small in data size and are short of diversity in environmental variations. this largely limits the development of since many practical problems such as the cross-modality setting cannot be fully studied. in this paper, we introduce, a large-scale, diverse posture-based distracted diver dataset, with more than 470k images taken by 4 cameras observing 100 drivers over 79 hours from 5 vehicles. involves different types of variations that closely meet real-world applications, including changes in the vehicle, person, camera view, lighting, and modality. we provide a detailed analysis of and present 4 settings for investigating practical problems of, including the traditional setting without domain shift and 3 challenging settings (i.e., cross-modality, cross-view, and cross-vehicle) with domain shifts. we conduct comprehensive experiments on these 4 settings with state-the-of-art techniques and show several insights to the future study of . our will be publicly available offering new opportunities to advance the development of . the 100-driver dataset, source code, and evaluation protocols are available at https://100-driver.github.io.",AB_0183
"monocular depth estimation is critical for endoscopists to perform spatial perception and 3d navigation of surgical sites. however, most of the existing methods ignore the important geometric structural consistency, which inevitably leads to performance degradation and distortion of 3d reconstruction. to address this issue, we introduce a gradient loss to penalize edge fluctuations ambiguous around stepped edge structures and a normal loss to explicitly express the sensitivity to frequently small structures, and propose a geometric consistency loss to spreads the spatial information across the sample grids to constrain the global geometric anatomy structures. in addition, we develop a synthetic rgb-depth dataset that captures the anatomical structures under reflections and illumination variations. the proposed method is extensively validated across different datasets and clinical images and achieves mean rmse values of 0.066 (stomach), 0.029 (small intestine), and 0.139 (colon) on the endoslam dataset. the generalizability of the proposed method achieves mean rmse values of 12.604 (t1-l1), 9.930 (t2-l2), and 13.893 (t3-l3) on the colondepth dataset. the experimental results show that our method exceeds previous state-of-the-art competitors and generates more consistent depth maps and reasonable anatomical structures. the quality of intraoperative 3d structure perception from endoscopic videos of the proposed method meets the accuracy requirements of video-ct registration algorithms for endoscopic navigation. the dataset and the source code will be available at https://github.com/yym-sia/lingmi-mr.",AB_0183
"modern drug discovery typically faces large virtual screens from huge compound databases where multiple docking tools are involved for meeting various real scenes or improving the precision of virtual screens. among these tools, autodock vina and its numerous derivatives are the most popular and have become the standard pipeline for molecular docking in modern drug discovery. our recent vina-gpu method realized 14-fold acceleration against autodock vina on a piece of nvidia rtx 3090 gpu in one virtual screening case. further speedup of autodock vina and its derivatives with graphics processing units (gpus) is beneficial to systematically push their popularization in large-scale virtual screens due to their high benefit-cost ratio and easy operation for users. thus, we proposed the vina-gpu 2.0 method to further accelerate autodock vina and the most common derivatives with new docking algorithms (quickvina 2 and quickvina-w) with gpus. caused by the discrepancy in their docking algorithms, our vina-gpu 2.0 adopts different gpu acceleration docking algorithms, adopts strategies. in virtual screening for two hot protein kinase targets, ripk1 and ripk3, from the drugbank database, our vina-gpu 2.0 reaches an average of 65.6-fold, 1.4-fold, and 3.6-fold docking acceleration against the original autodock vina, quickvina 2, and quickvina-w while ensuring their comparable docking accuracy. in addition, we develop a friendly and installation-free graphical user interface tool for their convenient usage. the codes and tools of vina-gpu 2.0 are freely available at https://github.com/ deltagroupnjupt/vina-gpu-2.0, coupled with explicit instructions and examples.",AB_0183
"ethnopharmacological relevance: kunxian capsule (kxc) is a new traditional chinese medicine drug included in the key science and technology achievements in the ninth five year plan of china. kxc has been clinically used for more than 10 years in the treatment of lupus nephritis (ln). however, the underlying role and molecular mechanism of kxc in ln remain unclear.aim of the study: this study aimed to explore the efficacy and potential mechanisms of kxc through pharma-cological network, in vitro and in vivo studies. materials and methods: pharmacological network analysis of kxc treatment in ln was performed using data acquired from the traditional chinese medicine system pharmacology database and analysis platform (tcmsp, https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php) and ncbi gene expression omnibus (geo, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/geo/database). hk-2 cells were chosen as an in vitro model of the tubular immune response by simulation with interferon gamma (ifn-gamma). mrl/lpr mice were used to explore the mechanism of kxc in vivo. finally, the specific active molecules of kxc were further analyzed by molecular docking.results: the pharmacological network analysis showed that stat1 is a key factor in the effects of kxc. in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the therapeutic effect of kxc on ln renal function and tubular inflammation. the protective effect of kxc is mediated by stat1 blockade, which further reduces t-cell infiltration and im-proves the renal microenvironment in ln. two main components of kxc, tripterygium hypoglaucum (h.le ' v.) hutch (shanhaitang) and epimedium brevicornu maxim (yinyanghuo) could block jak1-stat1 activation. furthermore, we found 8 molecules that could bind to the atp pocket of jak1 with high affinities by performing docking analysis.conclusions: kxc inhibits renal damage and t-cell infiltration in ln by blocking the jak1-stat1 pathway.",AB_0183
