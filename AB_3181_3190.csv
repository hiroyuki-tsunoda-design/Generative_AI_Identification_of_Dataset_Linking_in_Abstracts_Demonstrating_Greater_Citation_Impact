"subcellular localizations of ncrnas are associated with specific functions. currently, an increasing number of biological researchers are focusing on computational approaches to identify subcellular localizations of ncrnas. however, the performance of the existing computational methods is low and needs to be further studied. first, most prediction models are trained with outdated databases. second, only a few predictors can identify multiple subcellular localizations simultaneously. in this work, we establish three human ncrna subcellular datasets based on the latest rnalocate, including lncrna, mirna and snorna, and then we propose a novel multi label classification model based on ensemble learning called ncrnalocate-el to identify multi-label subcellular localizations of three ncrnas. the results show that the ncrnalocate-el outperforms previous methods. our method achieved an average precision of 0.709,0.977 and 0.730 on three human ncrna datasets. the web server of ncrnalocate-el has been established, which can be accessed at https://bliulab.net/ncrnalocate-el.",AB_0319
"pedestrian re-identification is highly dependent on discriminative features that enable images to encapsulate an arbitrary combination of multiple scales by different spatial scales. however, current models divide the scale by mechanical horizontal segmentation, which inevitably degenerate the re-identification performance. in this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale network (msnet) to extract a certain scale feature map through different branches before segmentation. the branches utilize backbone networks composed of multi-scale residual blocks to extract features at different scales. moreover, the specific segmentation method of the feature map is also based on its scale, which is opposite to the method of the first segmentation and then determine the scale. moreover, msnet significantly shortens the training and testing time owing to its lightweight design. experimental results evidently demonstrate that the proposed msnet shows superior performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness on three open-source data sets, compared with other models. codes are available at https://github.com/pky-imo/msnet.",AB_0319
"driver mutations can contribute to the initial processes of cancer, and their identification is crucial for understanding tumorigenesis as well as for molecular drug discovery and development. allostery regulates protein function away from the functional regions at an allosteric site. in addition to the known effects ofmutations around functional sites, mutations at allosteric sites have been associated with protein structure, dynamics, and energy communication. as a result, identifying driver mutations at allosteric sites will be beneficial for deciphering the mechanisms of cancer and developing allosteric drugs. in this study, we provided a platform called deepallodriver to predict driver mutations using a deep learning method that exhibited >93% accuracy and precision. using this server, we found that a missense mutation in rras2 (gln72 to leu) might serve as an allosteric driver of tumorigenesis, revealing the mechanism of the mutation in knock-in mice and cancer patients. overall, deepallodriver would facilitate the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying cancer progression and help prioritize cancer therapeutic targets. the web server is freely available at: https://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/deepallodriver.

"despite impressive capabilities and outstanding performance, deep neural networks (dnns) have become a growing concern among the public due to their frequently-appearing erroneous behaviors. as a result, it is urgent to test the security issues with dnns systematically before they are deployed to the real world. fine-grained metrics based on neuron coverage have been provided by existing testing approaches, and various approaches have been proposed to enhance these metrics. however, it has been gradually realized that a higher neuron coverage does not necessarily represent better capabilities in identifying defects that lead to errors. besides, coverage-guided methods cannot hunt errors due to faulty training procedure. so the robustness improvement of dnns via retraining by these testing examples are unsatisfactory. to tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of excitable neurons based on shapley value and design a white-box testing framework for dnns, namely deepsensor. it is motivated by our observation that neurons with larger responsibility towards model loss changes due to small perturbations are more likely related to incorrect corner cases due to potential defects. by maximizing the number of excitable neurons that correspond to various incorrect behaviors of models, deepsensor can generate testing examples that effectively trigger more erroneous security issues caused by malicious inputs (both adversarial and polluted data) and incomplete training. extensive experiments implemented on both image classification models and speaker recognition models have demonstrated the superiority of deepsensor. compared to the state-of-the-art testing methods, deepsensor has the ability to find more wrong model behaviors due to malicious inputs (i.e., similar to x1.2 for adversarial and similar to x4.7 for polluted data) and incompletely-trained dnns. additionally, it can help dnns build larger l(2)-norm robustness bound (similar to x3) via retraining according to clever's certification. furthermore, we provide interpretable certifications for effectiveness of deepsensor by identifying excitable neurons and visualizations via t-sne. the open source code of deepsensor can be downloaded at https://github.com/allen-piexl/deepsensor/.",AB_0319
"increasing data in allostery are requiring analysis of coupling relationships among different allosteric sites on a single protein. here, based on our previous efforts on reversed allosteric communication theory, we have developed alloreverse, a web server for multiscale analysis of multiple allosteric regulations. alloreverse integrates protein dynamics and machine learning to discover allosteric residues, allosteric sites and regulation pathways. especially, alloreverse could reveal hierarchical relationships between different pathways and couplings among allosteric sites, offering a whole map of allostery. the web server shows a good performance in re-emerging known allostery. moreover, we applied alloreverse to explore global allostery on cdc42 and sirt3. alloreverse predicted novel allosteric sites and allosteric residues in both systems, and the functionality of sites was validated experimentally. it also suggests a possible scheme for combined therapy or bivalent drugs on sirt3. taken together, alloreverse is a novel workflow providing a complete regulation map and is believed to aid target identification, drug design and understanding of biological mechanisms. alloreverse is freely available to all users at https://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/alloreverse/ or http://www.allostery.net/alloreverse/.

"extrachromosomal circular dnas (eccdnas) are widely observed in eukaryotes. previous studies have demonstrated that eccdnas are essential to cancer progression, and found that they can not only express in normal cells to regulate rna, but also function differently in different tissues. it is of major interest to conduct computational or experiments assay to elucidate the mechanisms of eccdna function, uncover key eccdnas associated with diseases, and even develop related algorithms for liquid biopsy. naturally, a comprehensive eccdnas data resource is urgently needed to provide annotation and analysis more in-depth research. in this study, we constructed the eccbase (http://www.eccbase.net) in literature curation and database retrieval, which was the first database mainly collecting eccdnas from homo sapiens (n = 754,391) and mus musculus (n = 481,381). homo sapiens eccdnas were taken from 50 kinds of cancer tissue and/or cell line, and 5 kinds of healthy tissues. the mus musculus eccdnas were sourced from 13 kinds of healthy tissue and/or cell line. we thoroughly annotated all eccdna molecules in terms of basic information, genomic composition, regulatory elements, epigenetic modifications, and raw data. eccbase provided users with the ability to browse, search, download for targets of interest, as well as similarity alignment by the integrated blast. further, comparative analysis suggested the cancer eccdna is composed of nucleosomes and is prominently derived from the gene-dense regions. we also initially revealed that eccdnas are strongly tissue-specific. in short, we have started a robust database for eccdna resource utilization, which may facilitate studying the role of eccdna in cancer development and therapy, cell function maintenance, and tissue differentiation.& copy; 2023 published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0319
"microbial communities influence host phenotypes through microbiota-derived metabolites and interactions between exogenous active substances (eass) and the microbiota. owing to the high dynamics of microbial community composition and difficulty in microbial functional analysis, the identification of mechanistic links between individual microbes and host phenotypes is complex. thus, it is important to characterize variations in microbial composition across various conditions (for example, topographical locations, times, physiological and pathological conditions, and populations of different ethnicities) in microbiome studies. however, no web server is currently available to facilitate such characterization. moreover, accurately annotating the functions of microbes and investigating the possible factors that shape microbial function are critical for discovering links between microbes and host phenotypes. herein, an online tool, cdemi, is introduced to discover microbial composition variations across different conditions, and five types of microbe libraries are provided to comprehensively characterize the functionality of microbes from different perspectives. these collective microbe libraries include (1) microbial functional pathways, (2) disease associations with microbes, (3) eass associations with microbes, (4) bioactive microbial metabolites, and (5) human body habitats. in summary, cdemi is unique in that it can reveal microbial patterns in distributions/compositions across different conditions and facilitate biological interpretations based on diverse microbe libraries. cdemi is accessible at http://rdblab.cn/cdemi/ (c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0319
"background surface polysaccharides (sps), such as lipopolysaccharide (o antigen) and capsular polysaccharide (k antigen), play a key role in the pathogenicity of escherichia coli (e. coli). gene cluster for polysaccharide antigen biosynthesis encodes various glycosyltransferases (gts), which drive the process of sp synthesis and determine the serotype. results in this study, a total of 7,741 e. coli genomic sequences were chosen for systemic data mining. the monosaccharides in both o and k antigens were dominated by d-hexopyranose, and the sps in 70-80% of the strains consisted of only the five most common hexoses (or some of them). the linkages between the two monosaccharides were mostly alpha-1,3 (23.15%) and beta-1,3 (20.49%) bonds. uridine diphosphate activated more than 50% of monosaccharides for glycosyltransferase reactions. these results suggest that the most common pathways could be integrated into chassis cells to promote glycan biosynthesis. we constructed a database (ecosp, http://ecosp.dmicrobe.cn/) for browse this information, such as monosaccharide synthesis pathways. it can also be used for serotype analysis and gt annotation of known or novel e. coli sequences, thus facilitating the diagnosis and typing. conclusions summarizing and analyzing the properties of these polysaccharide antigens and gts are of great significance for designing glycan-based vaccines and the synthetic glycobiology.",AB_0319
"deep learning on graphs has recently achieved remarkable success on a variety of tasks, while such success relies heavily on the massive and carefully labeled data. however, precise annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. to address this problem, self-supervised learning (ssl) is emerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. in this survey, we extend the concept of ssl, which first emerged in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive review of existing ssl techniques for graph data. specifically, we divide existing graph ssl methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and predictive. more importantly, unlike other surveys that only provide a high-level description of published research, we present an additional mathematical summary of existing works in a unified framework. furthermore, to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, open-source implementations, and experimental study of various algorithms. finally, we discuss the technical challenges and potential future directions for improving graph self-supervised learning. latest advances in graph ssl are summarized in a github repository https://github.com/lirongwu/awesome-graph-self-supervised-learning.",AB_0319
"traffic accident prediction based on dashboard cameras is of great significance for ensuring the guaranteed-safety of self-driving systems and reducing the occurrence of accidents. due to complexity of traffic scenarios and wide range of object's motion, early prediction of accidents remains a challenge. however, the existing methods process all traffic objects and all video frames indiscriminately, thus leading to poor prediction performance. to address this issue, we propose a novel traffic accident prediction framework, namely two-layer hidden state aggregation based two-stream network (that-net). the proposed method first fuses the spatial and temporal flow to capture complementary spatio-temporal information, which filters out irrelevant objects in traffic scenes to reduce the influence of the object's motion state. furthermore, a two-layer hidden state aggregation structure is designed to reintegrate the hidden state weights of gated recurrent units. it captures contextual information through frame-level and segment-level aggregation and decreases the influence of irrelevant frames to reduce the complexity of traffic scenes. experiments based on two real-world datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of that -net. our proposed method achieves the highest accuracy by predicting accidents 0.48 sec to 2.8 sec earlier compared to the baseline methods in more challenging situations. our code is available at: https://github .com /redeyezt /that-net.",AB_0319
