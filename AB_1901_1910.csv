"background and objective: open-source deep learning toolkits are one of the driving forces for develop-ing medical image segmentation models that are essential for computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment procedures. existing toolkits mainly focus on fully supervised segmentation that assumes full and accu-rate pixel-level annotations are available. such annotations are time-consuming and difficult to acquire for segmentation tasks, which makes learning from imperfect labels highly desired for reducing the an-notation cost. we aim to develop a new deep learning toolkit to support annotation-efficient learning for medical image segmentation, which can accelerate and simplify the development of deep learning models with limited annotation budget, e.g., learning from partial, sparse or noisy annotations.methods: our proposed toolkit named pymic is a modular deep learning library for medical image seg-mentation tasks. in addition to basic components that support development of high-performance models for fully supervised segmentation, it contains several advanced components that are tailored for learn-ing from imperfect annotations, such as loading annotated and unannounced images, loss functions for unannotated, partially or inaccurately annotated images, and training procedures for co-learning between multiple networks, etc. pymic is built on the pytorch framework and supports development of semi -supervised, weakly supervised and noise-robust learning methods for medical image segmentation.results: we present several illustrative medical image segmentation tasks based on pymic: (1) achieving competitive performance on fully supervised learning; (2) semi-supervised cardiac structure segmenta-tion with only 10% training images annotated; (3) weakly supervised segmentation using scribble anno-tations; and (4) learning from noisy labels for chest radiograph segmentation. conclusions: the pymic toolkit is easy to use and facilitates efficient development of medical image segmentation models with imperfect annotations. it is modular and flexible, which enables researchers to develop high-performance models with low annotation cost. the source code is available at: https://github.com/hilab-git/pymic .(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0191
"escherichia colt causes colibacillosis in chickens, which has severe economic and public health consequences. for the first time, we investigated the efficacy of gamma-irradiated e. coli to prevent colibacillosis in chickens considering different strains and application routes. electron microscopy, alamarblue assay and matrix assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of- flight mass spectrometry showed that the cellular structure, metabolic activity and protein profiles of irradiated and non-treated e. coli pai4/17480/5-ovary (serotype o1:k1) were similar. subsequently, three animal trials were performed using the irradiated e. colt and clinical signs, pathological lesions and bacterial colonization in systemic organs were assessed. in the first animal trial, the irradiated e. coli pai4/17480/5-ovary administered at / and z1 days of age via aerosol and oculonasal routes, respectively, prevented the occurrence of lesions and systemic bacterial spread after homologous challenge, as efficient as live infection or formalin-killed cells. in the second trial, a single aerosol application of the same irradiated strain in one-day old chickens was efficacious against challenges with a homologous or a heterologous strain (undefined serotype). the aerosol application elicited better protection as compared to oculonasal route. finally, in the third trial, efficacy against e. colt pa15/19103-3 (serotype 073:180) was shown. additionally, previous results of homologous protection were reconfirmed. the irradiated pal5/19103-3 strain, which also showed lower metabolic activity, was less preferred even for the homologous protection, underlining the importance of the vaccine strain. in all the trials, the irradiated e. colt did not provoke antibody response indicating the importance of innate or cell mediated immunity for protection. in conclusion, this proof-of-concept study showed that the non-adjuvanted single aerosol application of irradiated killed but metabolically active e. colt provided promising results to prevent colibacillosis in chickens at an early stage of life. the findings open new avenues for vaccine production with e. colt in chickens using irradiation technology. o 2023 the authors. published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license (http://",AB_0191
"owing to rich spectral and spatial information, hyperspectral image (hsi) can be utilized for finely classifying different land covers. with the emergence of deep learning techniques, convolutional neural network (cnn), fully convolutional network (fcn), and recurrent neural network (rnn) have been widely applied in the field of hsi classification. recently, transformer-based approaches represented by vision transformer (vit) have yielded promising performance on numerous tasks and have been introduced to classify hsi. however, existing methods based on the above architectures still face three crucial issues that limit the classification performance: 1) geometric constraints caused by input data, 2) contribution fuzziness of central pixels with details, and 3) interaction gap between local areas and further environments. to tackle the above problems, an interactive learning framework inspired by vit is proposed from a center to surrounding perspective, namely the center-to -surrounding interactive learning (csil) framework. different from existing works, the csil framework enables to achieve multi-scale, detail-aware, and space-interactive classification based on a well-designed hierarchical re-gion sampling strategy, center transformer, and surrounding transformer. specifically, a hierarchical region sampling strategy is first proposed to flexibly generate the center region, neighbor region, and surrounding re-gion, respectively. thus, multi-scale input data breaks the geometric constraints. second, a center transformer is presented to obtain core characteristics in detail based on the center region. in this way, central pixels are remarkably highlighted and the details are easily perceived. third, a surrounding transformer including inter-active self-attention learning is formulated for interacting both locally fine-grained distributions in the neighbor region and further coarse-grained environments in the surrounding region. with this structure, short-and long-term dependencies can be modeled, emphasized, and exchanged to bridge the interaction gap. finally, the features from center transformer and surrounding transformer are integrated, then fed into a multi-layer per-ceptron for the optimization of semantic representation. extensive experiments on six hsi datasets including small-, medium-, and large-scale scenes demonstrate the superiority over state-of-the-art cnn-, fcn-, rnn-and transformer-based approaches, even with very few training samples (for example 0.19% in complex hanchuan city scene). the source code will be available soon at https://github.com/jqyang22/csil.",AB_0191

"introduction mental well-being is associated with many mental health symptoms, including depression and health-related quality of life. digital divide could impact mental health, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic. information and communication technology (ict)-based tools and interventions could effectively provide social support. intergenerational mentoring between college students and older adults could promote ehealth literacy and self-efficacy, and it is advocated to bridge the digital divide for older adults. however, the effectiveness of an intervention which employs ict-based tools and intergenerational mentoring strategies (i.e. digital buddy) on mental well-being is unclear. methods this study will employ a multi-centre, cluster-randomized, two-parallel-group, noninferiority, controlled trial design with a 1:1 group allocation ratio. in the intervention group, a digital buddy (i.e. a young volunteer) is assigned to a group of older adults in a 1:10 ratio. a series of training sessions for a minimum of 23 h will be provided to the older adults by digital buddy, who will also follow through the intervention period with the older participants. the training contents include ict and mental health care knowledge and skills. the whole intervention period will last for 6 months between 14 sessions. in the control group, participants will receive the usual care. the primary outcome measure is mental well-being. we aim to recruit 292 older participants. generalized estimating equations (gee) will be used to examine the effects of the intervention. ethics and dissemination this trial has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov (nct05553730) on 23 september 2022, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct05553730, and all items come from the world health organization trial registration data set. it has been approved by the research ethics committee of tung wah college, hong kong (reference number: rec2022143). the findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences relevant to the subject fields.",AB_0191
"human leukocyte antigen (hla) plays a vital role in immunomodulatory function. studies have shown that immunotherapy based on non-classical hla has essential applications in cancer, covid-19, and allergic diseases. however, there are few deep learning methods to predict non-classical hla alleles. in this work, an adaptive dual-attention network named dapnet-hla is established based on existing datasets. firstly, amino acid se-quences are transformed into digital vectors by looking up the table. to overcome the feature sparsity problem caused by unique one-hot encoding, the fused word embedding method is used to map each amino acid to a low-dimensional word vector optimized with the training of the classifier. then, we use the gcb (group convolution block), senet attention (squeeze-and-excitation networks), bilstm (bidirectional long short-term memory network), and bahdanau attention mechanism to construct the classifier. the use of senet can make the weight of the effective feature map high, so that the model can be trained to achieve better results. attention mechanism is an encoder-decoder model used to improve the effectiveness of rnn, lstm or gru (gated recurrent neural network). the ablation experiment shows that dapnet-hla has the best adaptability for five datasets. on the five test datasets, the acc index and mcc index of dapnet-hla are 4.89% and 0.0933 higher than the comparison method, respectively. according to the roc curve and pr curve verified by the 5-fold cross-validation, the auc value of each fold has a slight fluctuation, which proves the robustness of the dapnet-hla. the codes and datasets are accessible at https://github.com/jyy625/dapnet-hla.",AB_0191
"cocrystal engineering as an effective way to modify solid-state properties has inspired great interest from diverse material fields while cocrystal density is an important property closely correlated with the material function. in order to accurately predict the cocrystal density, we develop a graph neural network (gnn)-based deep learning framework by considering three key factors of machine learning (data quality, feature presentation, and model architecture). the result shows that different stoichiometric ratios of molecules in cocrystals can significantly influence the prediction performances, highlighting the importance of data quality. in addition, the feature complementary is not suitable for augmenting the molecular graph representation in the cocrystal density prediction, suggesting that the complementary strategy needs to consider whether extra features can sufficiently supplement the lacked information in the original representation. based on these results, 4144 cocrystals with 1:1 stoichiometry ratio are selected as the dataset, supplemented by the data augmentation of exchanging a pair of coformers. the molecular graph is determined to learn feature representation to train the gnn-based model. global attention is introduced to further optimize the feature space and identify important atoms to realize the interpretability of the model. benefited from the advantages, our model significantly outperforms three competitive models and exhibits high prediction accuracy for unseen cocrystals, showcasing its robustness and generality. overall, our work not only provides a general cocrystal density prediction tool for experimental investigations but also provides useful guidelines for the machine learning application. all source codes are freely available at https://github.com/xiao-gua00/ ccpgraph.",AB_0191
"grasping good understanding of the weight-bearing spatial structure of the spine of a human subject in a standing position is critical for the treatment of spinal disorders. such disorders are commonly diagnosed via 2d x-ray imaging of the human subject in a standing position. however, 3d reconstruction techniques based on bi-planar x-ray imaging can enable better exploration and analysis of the spinal structure. in particular, compared to earlier deformable modeling approaches, the recently-developed deep-learning-based 3d reconstruction methods exhibit higher efficiency and generalizability. but these methods usually employ simple architectures with 2d encoders and 3d decoders. thus, these methods have several drawbacks, namely, the existence of a semantic gap between dimensionally-inconsistent feature maps, the difficulty of jointly handling multi-view inputs, and the information source limitations for the decoding process. in order to better assist clinicians and tackle these problems, we propose a novel convolutional neural network framework, which we call bx2s-net, to effectively achieve 3d spine reconstruction based on bi-planar x-ray images. in particular, a dimensionally -consistent encoder-decoder architecture is designed in conjunction with a dimensionality enhancement method in order to reduce the semantic gap between feature maps and achieve information fusion for multi-view inputs. a feature-guided progressive decoding process is developed on the decoder side, where a full-scale feature attention guidance (ffag) module is introduced to efficiently aggregate image features and guide the decoding process at each level. in addition, a class augmentation method and a spatially-weighted cross-entropy loss function are used for network training with improved reconstruction quality for the vertebral edge region. the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in reconstructing high-quality 3d spinal structures from bi-planar x-ray images. the code is available at https://github.com/nbu-cvmi/bx2s-net.",AB_0191
"diabetes mellitus (dm) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycaemia in the absence of treatment. classification of dm is essential as it corresponds to the respective diagnosis and treatment. in this paper, we propose a new coupling network with hierarchical dual-attention that utilizes heterogeneous data, including flash glucose monitoring (fgm) data and biomarkers in electronic medical records. the long short-term memory-based fgm sub-network extracts the time-dependent features of dynamic fgm sequences, while the biomarkers sub-network learns the features of static biomarkers. the convolutional block attention module (cbam) for dispersing the feature weights of the spatial and channel dimensions is implemented into the fgm sub-network to endure the variability of fgm and allows us to extract high-level discriminative features more accurately. to better adjust the importance weights of the characteristics of the two sub-networks, self-attention is introduced to integrate the characteristics of heterogeneous data. based on the dataset provided by peking university people's hospital, the proposed method is evaluated through factorial experiments of multi-source heterogeneous data, ablation studies of various attention strategies, time consumption evaluation and quantitative evaluation. the benchmark tests reveal the proposed network achieves a type 1 and 2 diabetes classification accuracy of 95.835% and the comprehensive performance metrics, including matthews correlation coefficient, f1-score and g-mean, are 91.333%, 94.939% and 94.937% respectively. in the factorial experiments, the proposed method reaches the maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9428, which indicates the effectiveness of the coupling between the nominated sub-networks. the coupling network with a dual-attention strategy performs better than the one without or only with a single-attention strategy in the ablation study as well. in addition, the model is also tested on another data set, and the accuracy of the test reaches 94.286%, reflecting that the model is robust when it is transferred to untrained diabetes data. the experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible in the classification of diabetes types. the code is available at https://github.com/bitdalei/diabetes-classification-with-heterogeneous-data.",AB_0191
"hyperspectral image super-resolution (hisr) is about fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral image (lr-hsi) and a high-resolution multispectral image (hr-msi) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image (hr-hsi). recently, convolutional neural network (cnn)-based techniques have been extensively investigated for hisr yielding competitive outcomes. however, existing cnn-based methods often require a huge amount of network parameters leading to a heavy computational burden, thus, limiting the generalization ability. in this article, we fully consider the characteristic of the hisr, proposing a general cnn fusion framework with high-resolution guidance, called guidednet. this framework consists of two branches, including 1) the high-resolution guidance branch (hgb) that can decompose the high-resolution guidance image into several scales and 2) the feature reconstruction branch (frb) that takes the low-resolution image and the multiscaled high-resolution guidance images from the hgb to reconstruct the high-resolution fused image. guidednet can effectively predict the high-resolution residual details that are added to the upsampled hsi to simultaneously improve spatial quality and preserve spectral information. the proposed framework is implemented using recursive and progressive strategies, which can promote high performance with a significant network parameter reduction, even ensuring network stability by supervising several intermediate outputs. additionally, the proposed approach is also suitable for other resolution enhancement tasks, such as remote sensing pansharpening and single-image super-resolution (sisr). extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework generates state-of-the-art outcomes for several applications (i.e., hisr, pansharpening, and sisr). finally, an ablation study and more discussions assessing, for example, the network generalization, the low computational cost, and the fewer network parameters, are provided to the readers. the code link is: https://github.com/evangelion09/guidednet.",AB_0191
