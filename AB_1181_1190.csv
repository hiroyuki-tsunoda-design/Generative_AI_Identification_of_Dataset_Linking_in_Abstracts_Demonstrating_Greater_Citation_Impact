"motivation: understanding comorbidity is essential for disease prevention, treatment and prognosis. in particular, insight into which pairs of diseases are likely or unlikely to co-occur may help elucidate the potential relationships between complex diseases. here, we introduce the use of an inter-disease interactivity network to discover/prioritize comorbidities. specifically, we determine disease associations by accounting for the direction of effects of genetic components shared between diseases, and categorize those associations as synergistic or antagonistic. we further develop a comorbidity scoring algorithm to predict whether diseases are more or less likely to co-occur in the presence of a given index disease. this algorithm can handle networks that incorporate relationships with opposite signs. results: we finally investigate inter-disease associations among 427 phenotypes in uk biobank phewas data and predict the priority of comorbid diseases. the predicted comorbidities were verified using the uk biobank inpatient electronic health records. our findings demonstrate that considering the interaction of phenotype associations might be helpful in better predicting comorbidity. availability and implementation: the source code and data of this study are available at https://github.com/dokyoonkimlab/diseaseinteractivenetwork. contact: wonhh@skku.edu or dokyoon.kim@pennmedicine.upenn.edu supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0119
"in this study, we show two methods concerning constructions of maximally localized wannier functions (mlwfs) using crystal symmetry. the first one is to compute input matrices for generating mlwfs only using wavefunctions in the irreducible brillouin zone (ibz). this approach reduces the computational costs and the size of intermediate files in proportion to the number of k points in the ibz. the sec-ond method is to calculate the symmetry-adapted wannier functions that are compatible with so-called frozen window technique, that is, the procedure to disentangle band structures by forcing bloch states in a certain energy range to be included. we demonstrate how these work in the case of fe, co3sn2s2, cu, and nb. these methods are implemented in pw2wannier90 code, which interfaces quantum-espresso with the wannier90, and the open-source python library, symwannier. the code supports both unitary and anti-unitary symmetry operations as well as nonsymmorphic group operations, spin -orbit couplings, and ultrasoft/paw pseudopotentials. all of these codes are available on github (https:// github .com /wannier-utils -dev /symwannier).(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0119
"n6-methyladenine (6ma) plays a critical role in various epigenetic processing including dna replication, dna repair, silencing, transcription, and diseases such as cancer. to understand such epigenetic mechanisms, 6 ma has been detected by high-throughput technologies on a genome-wide scale at single-base resolution, to-gether with conventional methods such as immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and capillary electro-phoresis, but these experimental approaches are time-consuming and laborious. to complement these problems, we have developed a cnn-based 6 ma site predictor, named cnn6ma, which proposed two new architectures: a position-specific 1-d convolutional layer and a cross-interactive network. in the position -specific 1-d convolutional layer, position-specific filters with different window sizes were applied to an in-quiry sequence instead of sharing the same filters over all positions in order to extract the position-specific features at different levels. the cross-interactive network explored the relationships between all the nu-cleotide patterns within the inquiry sequence. consequently, cnn6ma outperformed the existing state-of-the-art models in many species and created the contribution score vector that intelligibly interpret the prediction mechanism. the source codes and web application in cnn6ma are freely accessible at https:// github.com/kuratahiroyuki/cnn6ma.git and http://kurata35.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/cnn6ma/, respectively.(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by license ( licenses/by/4.0/).",AB_0119
"this paper presents version 1.0 of the world atlas of last interglacial shorelines (walis), a global database of sea-level proxies and samples dated to marine isotope stage 5 (similar to 80 to 130 ka). the database includes a series of datasets compiled in the framework of a special issue published in this journal (https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/special_issue1055.html, last access: 15 december 2022). this paper collates the individual contributions (archived in a zenodo community at https://zenodo.org/communities/walis_database/, last access: 15 december 2022) into an open-access, standalone database (rovere et al., 2022, https://doi.org/ 10.5281/zenodo.7348242). the release of walis 1.0 includes complete documentation and scripts to down-load, analyze, and visualize the data (https://alerovere.github.io/walis/, last access: 15 december 2022). the database contains 4545 sea-level proxies (e.g., marine terraces or fossil beach deposits), 4110 dated samples (e.g., corals dated with u-series), and 280 other time constraints (e.g., biostratigraphic constraints or tephra layers) interconnected with several tables containing accessory data and metadata. by creating a centralized database of sea-level proxy data for the last interglacial, the walis database will be a valuable resource to the broader paleoclimate community to facilitate data-model integration and intercomparisons, assessments of sea-level reconstructions between different studies and different regions, as well as comparisons between past sea-level history and other paleoclimate proxy data.",AB_0119
"teratogenic drugs can lead to extreme fetal malformation and consequently critically influence the fetus's health, yet the teratogenic risks associated with most approved drugs are unknown. here, we propose a novel predictive tool, embryotox, which utilizes a graph-based signature representation of the chemical structure of a small molecule to predict and classify molecules likely to be safe during pregnancy. embryotox was trained and validated using in vitro bioactivity data of over 700 small molecules with characterized teratogenicity effects. our final model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) of up to 0.96 on 10-fold cross-validation and 0.82 on nonredundant blind tests, outperforming alternative approaches. we believe that our predictive tool will provide a practical resource for optimizing screening libraries to determine effective and safe molecules to use during pregnancy. to provide a simple and integrated platform to rapidly screen for potential safe molecules and their risk factors, we made embryotox freely available online at https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/embryotox/.",AB_0119
"deep learning has largely reshaped remote sensing (rs) research for aerial image understanding and made a great success. nevertheless, most of the existing deep models are initialized with the imagenet pretrained weights since natural images inevitably present a large domain gap relative to aerial images, probably limiting the fine-tuning performance on downstream aerial scene tasks. this issue motivates us to conduct an empirical study of rs pretraining (rsp) on aerial images. to this end, we train different networks from scratch with the help of the largest rs scene recognition dataset up to now-millionaid-to obtain a series of rs pretrained backbones, including both convolutional neural networks (cnns) and vision transformers, such as swin and vitae, which have shown promising performance on computer vision tasks. then, we investigate the impact of rsp on representative downstream tasks, including scene recognition, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection using these cnn and vision transformer backbones. empirical study shows that rsp can help deliver distinctive performances in scene recognition tasks and in perceiving rs-related semantics, such as bridge and airplane. we also find that, although rsp mitigates the data discrepancies of traditional imagenet pretraining on rs images, it may still suffer from task discrepancies, where downstream tasks require different representations from scene recognition tasks. these findings call for further research efforts on both large-scale pretraining datasets and effective pretraining methods. the codes and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/vitaetransformer/vitae-transformer-remote-sensing.",AB_0119
"large-scale vision foundation models have made significant progress in visual tasks on natural images, with vision transformers (vits) being the primary choice due to their good scalability and representation ability. however, large-scale models in remote sensing (rs) have not yet been sufficiently explored. in this article, we resort to plain vits with about 100 million parameters and make the first attempt to propose large vision models tailored to rs tasks and investigate how such large models perform. to handle the large sizes and objects of arbitrary orientations in rs images, we propose a new rotated varied-size window attention to replace the original full attention in transformers, which can significantly reduce the computational cost and memory footprint while learning better object representation by extracting rich context from the generated diverse windows. experiments on detection tasks show the superiority of our model over all state-of-the-art models, achieving 81.24% mean average precision (map) on the dota-v1.0 dataset. the results of our models on downstream classification and segmentation tasks also show competitive performance compared to existing advanced methods. further experiments show the advantages of our models in terms of computational complexity and data efficiency in transferring. the code and models will be released at https://github.com/vitae-transformer/remote-sensing-rvsa.",AB_0119
"sparse representation (sr)-based hyperspectral image (hsi) denoising methods normally average the local denoising results of multiple overlapped cubes to recover the whole hsi. though interpretable, they rely on cumbersome hyperparameter settings and ignore the relationship between overlapped cubes, leading to poor denoising performance. this article combines sr and convolutional neural networks and introduces a deep parameterized sparse neural network (dpnet-s) to address the above issues. dpnet-s parameterizes the sr-based hsi denoising model with two modules: 1) sparse optimizer to extract sparse feature maps from noisy hsis via recurrent usage of convolution, deconvolution, and soft shrinkage operations; and 2) image reconstructor to recover the denoised hsi from its sparse feature maps via deconvolution operations. we further replace the soft shrinkage operator with u-net architecture to account for general hsi priors and more effectively capture the complex structures of hsis, resulting in dpnet-u. both networks directly learn the parameters from data and perform denoising on the whole hsi, which overcomes the limitations of sr-based methods. moreover, our networks are generated from the denoising model and optimization procedures, thus leveraging the knowledge embedded and relying less on the number of training samples. extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world hsis show that our dpnet-s and dpnet-u achieve remarkable results when compared with state-of-the-art methods. the codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/bearshng/dpnets for reproducible research.",AB_0119
"in today's social media-dominated landscape, digital platforms wield substantial influence over public opinion, particularly during crucial political events such as electoral processes. these platforms become hubs for diverse discussions, encompassing topics, reforms, and desired changes. notably, in times of government dissatisfaction, they serve as arenas for anti-establishment discourse, highlighting the need to analyze public sentiment in these conversations. however, the analysis of such discourse is notably scarce, even in high-resource languages, and entirely non-existent in the context of the nepali language. to address this critical gap, we present nepal anti establishment discourse tweets (naet), a novel dataset comprising 4,445 multi-aspect annotated nepali tweets, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of political conversations. our contributions encompass evaluating tweet relevance, sentiment, and satire, while also exploring the presence of hate speech, identifying its targets, and distinguishing directed and non-directed expressions. additionally, we investigate hope speech, an underexplored aspect crucial in the context of anti-establishment discourse, as it reflects the aspirations and expectations from new political figures and parties. furthermore, we set nlp-based baselines for all these tasks. to ensure a holistic analysis, we also employ topic modeling, a powerful technique that helps us identify and understand the prevalent themes and patterns emerging from the discourse. our research thus presents a comprehensive and multi-faceted perspective on anti-establishment election discourse in a low-resource language setting. the dataset is publicly available, facilitating in-depth analysis of political tweets in nepali discourse and further advancing nlp research for the nepali language through labeled data and baselines for various nlp tasks. the dataset for this work is made available at https://github.com/rkritesh210/naet.",AB_0119
"automated surveillance is widely opted for applications such as traffic monitoring, vehicle identification, etc. but, various weather degradation factors such as rain and snow streaks, along with atmospheric veil severely affect the perceptual quality of an image, eventually affecting the performance of these applications. there exist weather specific (rain, haze, snow, etc.) methods focusing on respective restoration task. as image restoration is a preprocessing step for high level surveillance applications, it is practically inapplicable to have different architectures for different weather restoration. in this paper, we propose a lightweight unified network, having 1.1 m parameters (1/40th and 1/6th of the existing rain with veil removal, and snow with veil removal methods respectively) for removal of rain and snow along with the veiling effect present in the images. in this network, we propose two parallel streams to handle the degradations and restoration: first, degradation removal stream (drs) focuses mainly on removing randomly repeating degradations i.e., rain and snow streaks, through the proposed adaptive multi-scale feature sharing block (amfsb) and stage-wise subtractive block (ssb). second, feature corrector stream (fcs) mainly focuses on refining the partial outputs of the first stream, reducing the veiling effect and acts supplementary to the first stream. finally, we leverage contrastive regularization for better convergence of the proposed network. substantial experiments on synthetic as well as real-world images, along with extensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed method performs competitively with the existing methods for multi-weather image restoration. the code is available at: https://github.com/ashutoshkulkarni4998/uvrnet.",AB_0119
