"gathering information from multi-perspective graphs is an essential issue for many applications especially for protein-ligand-binding affinity prediction. most of traditional approaches obtained such information individually with low interpretability. in this paper, we harness the rich information from multi-perspective graphs with a general model, which abstractly represents protein-ligand complexes with better interpretability while achieving excellent predictive performance. in addition, we specially analyze the protein-ligand-binding affinity problem, taking into account the heterogeneity of proteins and ligands. experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our data representation strategy on public datasets by fusing information from different perspectives. all codes are available in the https://github.com/jthy-af/happy.",AB_0082
"motivation: microbial communities have a profound impact on both human health and various environments. viruses infecting bacteria, known as bacteriophages or phages, play a key role in modulating bacterial communities within environments. high-quality phage genome sequences are essential for advancing our understanding of phage biology, enabling comparative genomics studies and developing phage-based diagnostic tools. most available viral identification tools consider individual sequences to determine whether they are of viral origin. as a result of challenges in viral assembly, fragmentation of genomes can occur, and existing tools may recover incomplete genome fragments. therefore, the identification and characterization of novel phage genomes remain a challenge, leading to the need of improved approaches for phage genome recovery. results: we introduce phables, a new computational method to resolve phage genomes from fragmented viral metagenome assemblies. phables identifies phage-like components in the assembly graph, models each component as a flow network, and uses graph algorithms and flow decomposition techniques to identify genomic paths. experimental results of viral metagenomic samples obtained from different environments show that phables recovers on average over 49% more high-quality phage genomes compared to existing viral identification tools. furthermore, phables can resolve variant phage genomes with over 99% average nucleotide identity, a distinction that existing tools are unable to make. availability and implementation: phables is available on github at https://github.com/vini2/phables.",AB_0082
"objective illness perceptions are views and beliefs formed in response to a health threat, and they may influence self-management behaviours and chronic disease outcomes. despite effective medication, sub-optimal outcomes in gout are common. this study aimed to quantitatively investigate illness perceptions in gout to examine how illness perceptions relate to health outcomes. methods data were obtained from a randomized controlled trial in which people with gout (n=493) completed surveys measuring illness perceptions [brief illness perception questionnaire (b-ipq)], gout flares, medication adherence, health-related quality of life, health-care utilization, and productivity, alongside serum urate blood tests at baseline, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. multivariable linear regression identified patient factors independently associated with each b-ipq item score. logistic and linear regression, adjusted for age and sex, determined whether baseline b-ipq items could predict current and future health outcomes. results younger individuals and those with severe gout were more likely to experience pessimistic illness perceptions at baseline. optimistic illness perceptions were associated with lower odds of having had at least one flare in the preceding 6months. every 1-point increase in b-ipq treatment control, indicating an increasingly optimistic view that gout is treatable, decreased the odds of a recent flare prior to baseline by 33% [odds ratio (or): 0.67; 95% ci: 0.53, 0.85; p<0.001] and prior to the 12-month follow-up by 15% (or: 0.85; 95% ci: 0.76,0.96; p=0.01). pessimistic illness perceptions also predicted poorer medication adherence, health-related quality of life, and productivity, but not serum urate levels. conclusion modifying pessimistic illness perceptions, including, but not limited to, patient education, may promote prudent self-management behaviours and better outcomes in gout. trial registration australian new zealand clinical trials registry; https://www.anzctr.org.au/, actrn12616000455460.",AB_0082
"motivation efficient assessment of the blood-brain barrier (bbb) penetration ability of a drug compound is one of the major hurdles in central nervous system drug discovery since experimental methods are costly and time-consuming. to advance and elevate the success rate of neurotherapeutic drug discovery, it is essential to develop an accurate computational quantitative model to determine the absolute logbb value (a logarithmic ratio of the concentration of a drug in the brain to its concentration in the blood) of a drug candidate.results here, we developed a quantitative model (logbb_pred) capable of predicting a logbb value of a query compound. the model achieved an r2 of 0.61 on an independent test dataset and outperformed other publicly available quantitative models. when compared with the available qualitative (classification) models that only classified whether a compound is bbb-permeable or not, our model achieved the same accuracy (0.85) with the best qualitative model and far-outperformed other qualitative models (accuracies between 0.64 and 0.70). for further evaluation, our model, quantitative models, and the qualitative models were evaluated on a real-world central nervous system drug screening library. our model showed an accuracy of 0.97 while the other models showed an accuracy in the range of 0.29-0.83. consequently, our model can accurately classify bbb-permeable compounds as well as predict the absolute logbb values of drug candidates.availability and implementation web server is freely available on the web at http://ssbio.cau.ac.kr/software/logbb_pred/. the data used in this study are available to download at http://ssbio.cau.ac.kr/software/logbb_pred/dataset.zip. graphical abstract",AB_0082
"fragment-based drug discovery (fbdd) is a well-established and effective method for generating diverse and novel hits in drug design. kinases are suitable targets for fbdd due to their well-defined structure. water molecules contribute to structure and function of proteins and also influence the environment within the binding pocket. water molecules form a variety of hydrogen-bonded cyclic water-ring networks, collectively known as topological water networks (twns). analyzing the twns in protein binding sites can provide valuable insights into potential locations and shapes for fragments within the binding site. here, we introduce twn-based fragment screening (twn-fs) method, a novel screening method that suggests fragments through grouped twn analysis within the protein binding site. we used this method to screen known cdk2, chk1, igf1r and erbb4 inhibitors. our findings suggest that twn-fs method has the potential to effectively screen fragments. the twnfs method package is available on github at https://github.com/pkj0421/twn-fs.",AB_0082
"accurate segmentation of 3d medical images is vital for computer-aided diagnosis. however, the complexity of target morphological variations and a scarcity of labeled data make segmentation more challenging. furthermore, existing models make it difficult to fully and efficiently integrate global and local information, which hinders structured knowledge acquisition. to overcome these challenges, we introduce the tnt masking network (tnt-mnet), a groundbreaking transformer-based 3d model that utilizes a transformer-in-transformer (tnt) encoder. for the first time, we present masked image modeling (mim) in supervised learning, utilizing target boundary regions as masked prediction targets to enhance structured knowledge acquisition. we execute multiscale random masking on inner and outer tokens in online branch to tackle the challenge of segmenting organs and lesion regions with varying structures at multiple scales and to enhance modeling capabilities. in contrast, the target branch utilizes all tokens to guide the online branch to reconstruct the masked tokens. our experiments suggest that tnt-mnet's performance is comparable, or even better, than state-of-the-art models in three medical image datasets (btcv, lits2017, and brats2020) and effectively reduces the dependence on labeled data. the code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/changliu-work/tnt_mnet.",AB_0082

"motivation asthma is a heterogeneous disease where various subtypes are established and molecular biomarkers of the subtypes are yet to be discovered. recent availability of multi-omics data paved a way to discover molecular biomarkers for the subtypes. however, multi-omics biomarker discovery is challenging because of the complex interplay between different omics layers.results we propose a deep attention model named gene-level biomarker discovery from multi-omics data using graph attention neural network (goat) for identifying molecular biomarkers for eosinophilic asthma subtypes with multi-omics data. goat identifies genes that discriminate subtypes using a graph neural network by modeling complex interactions among genes as the attention mechanism in the deep learning model. in experiments with multi-omics profiles of the corea (cohort for reality and evolution of adult asthma in korea) asthma cohort of 300 patients, goat outperforms existing models and suggests interpretable biological mechanisms underlying asthma subtypes. importantly, goat identified genes that are distinct only in terms of relationship with other genes through attention. to better understand the role of biomarkers, we further investigated two transcription factors, ctnnb1 and jun, captured by goat. we were successful in showing the role of the transcription factors in eosinophilic asthma pathophysiology in a network propagation and transcriptional network analysis, which were not distinct in terms of gene expression level differences.availability and implementation source code is available https://github.com/dabinjeong/multi-omics_biomarker. the preprocessed data underlying this article is accessible in data folder of the github repository. raw data are available in multi-omics platform at http://203.252.206.90:5566/, and it can be accessible when requested.",AB_0082
"plant disease detection has made significant strides thanks to the emergence of deep learning. however, existing methods have been limited to closed-set and static learning settings, where models are trained using a specific dataset. this confinement restricts the model's adaptability when encountering samples from unseen disease categories. additionally, there is a challenge of knowledge degradation for these static learning settings, as the acquisition of new knowledge tends to overwrite the old when learning new categories. to overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel paradigm for plant disease detection called open-world setting. our approach can infer disease categories that have never been seen during the model training phase and gradually learn these unseen diseases through dynamic knowledge updates in the next training phase. specifically, we utilize a well-trained unknown-aware region proposal network to generate pseudo-labels for unknown diseases during training and employ a class-agnostic classifier to enhance the recall rate for unknown diseases. besides, we employ a sample replay strategy to maintain recognition ability for previously learned classes. extensive experimental evaluation and ablation studies investigate the efficacy of our method in detecting old and unknown classes. remarkably, our method demonstrates robust generalization ability even in cross-species disease detection experiments. overall, this open-world and dynamically updated detection method shows promising potential to become the future paradigm for plant disease detection. we discuss open issues including classification and localization, and propose promising approaches to address them. we encourage further research in the community to tackle the crucial challenges in open-world plant disease detection. the code will be released at https://github.com/jiuqingdong/owpdd.",AB_0082
"objective cerebral infarction is a common complication in patients undergoing revascularization surgery for moyamoya disease (mmd). although previous statistical evaluations have identified several risk factors for postoperative brain ischemia, the ability to predict its occurrence based on these limited predictors remains inadequately explored. this study aimed to assess the feasibility of machine learning algorithms for predicting cerebral infarction after revascularization surgery in patients with mmd. methods this retrospective study was conducted across two centers and harnessed data from 512 patients with mmd who had undergone revascularization surgery. the patient cohort was partitioned into internal and external data- sets. using perioperative clinical data from the internal cohort, three distinct machine learning algorithms-namely the support vector machine, random forest, and light gradient-boosting machine models-were trained and cross-validated to predict the occurrence of postoperative cerebral infarction. predictive performance validity was subsequently assessed using an external dataset. shapley additive explanations (shap) analysis was conducted to augment the prediction model's transparency and to quantify the impact of each input variable on shaping both the aggregate and individual patient predictions. results in the cohort of 512 patients, 33 (6.4%) experienced postrevascularization cerebral infarction. the cross- validation outcomes revealed that, among the three models, the support vector machine model achieved the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (roc-auc) at mean +/- sd 0.785 +/- 0.052. notably, during external validation, the light gradient-boosting machine model exhibited the highest accuracy at 0.903 and the largest roc-auc at 0.710. the top-performing prediction model utilized five input variables: postoperative serum gamma-glutamyl trans- peptidase value, positive posterior cerebral artery (pca) involvement on preoperative mra, infarction as the rationale for surgery, presence of an infarction scar on preoperative mri, and preoperative modified rankin scale score. furthermore, the shap analysis identified presence of pca involvement, infarction as the rationale for surgery, and presence of an infarction scar on preoperative mri as positive influences on postoperative cerebral infarction. conclusions this study indicates the usefulness of employing machine learning techniques with routine perioperative data to predict the occurrence of cerebral infarction after revascularization procedures in patients with mmd. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2024.1.jns232173",AB_0082
