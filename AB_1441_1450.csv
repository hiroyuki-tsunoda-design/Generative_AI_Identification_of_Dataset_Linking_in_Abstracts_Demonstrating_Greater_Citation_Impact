"though a series of computer aided measures have been taken for the rapid and definite diagnosis of 2019 coronavirus disease (covid-19), they generally fail to achieve high enough accuracy, including the recently popular deep learning-based methods. the main reasons are that: (a) they generally focus on improving the model structures while ignoring important information contained in the medical image itself; (b) the existing small-scale datasets have difficulty in meeting the training requirements of deep learning. in this paper, a dualstream network based on the efficientnet is proposed for the covid-19 diagnosis based on ct scans. the dualstream network takes into account the important information in both spatial and frequency domains of ct scans. besides, adversarial propagation (advprop) technology is used to address the insufficient training data usually faced by the deep learning-based computer aided diagnosis and also the overfitting issue. feature pyramid network (fpn) is utilized to fuse the dual-stream features. experimental results on the public dataset covidx ct2a demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing 12 deep learning-based methods for covid19 diagnosis, achieving an accuracy of 0.9870 for multi-class classification, and 0.9958 for binary classification. the source code is available at https://github.com/imagecbj/covid-efficientnet.",AB_0145
"crispr/cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome editing. numerous studies have shown that sgrnas can strongly affect the efficiency of editing. however, it is still not clear what rules should be followed for designing sgrna with high cleavage efficiency. at present, several machine learning or deep learning methods have been developed to predict the cleavage efficiency of sgrnas, however, the prediction accuracy of these tools is still not satisfactory. here we propose a fusion framework of deep learning and machine learning, which first deals with the primary sequence and secondary structure features of the sgrnas using both convolutional neural network (cnn) and recurrent neural network (rnn), and then uses the features extracted by the deep neural network to train a conventional machine learning model with lgbm. as a result, the new approach overwhelmed previous methods. the spearman's correlation coefficient between predicted and measured sgrna cleavage efficiency of our model (0.917) is improved by over 5% compared with the most advanced method (0.865), and the mean square error reduces from 7.89 x 10-3 to 4.75 x 10-3. finally, we developed an online tool, crisep (http://www.cuilab.cn/crisep), to evaluate the availability of sgrnas based on our models.",AB_0145
"rgbt person detection benefits numerous vital applications like surveillance, search, and rescue. meanwhile, drones can capture images holding broad perspectives and large searching regions per frame, which can notably improve the efficacy of large-scale search and rescue missions. in this work, we leverage the advantages of drone-based vision for rgbt person detection. the drone-based rgbt person detection task brings interesting challenges to existing cross-modality object detectors, e.g., tiny sizes of objects, modality-space imbalance, and position shifts. observing that there is a lack of data and customized detectors for drone-based rgbt person detection, we contribute two new datasets and design a novel detector. the data contribution is two-fold. for one, we construct the first large-scale drone-based rgbt person detection benchmark rgbtdroneperson, which contains 6,125 pairs of rgbt images and 70,880 instances. images are captured in various scenes and under various illumination and weather conditions. for another, we annotate the vtuav tracking dataset and obtain its object detection version, named vtuav-det. to tackle the challenges raised by this task, we propose a quality-aware rgbt fusion detector (qfdet). firstly, we design a quality-aware learning strategy (qls) to provide sufficient supervision for tiny objects while focusing on high-quality samples, in which a quality-aware factor (qaf) is designed to measure the quality. moreover, a quality-aware cross-modality enhancement module (qce) is proposed to predict a qaf map for each modality, which not only indicates the reliability of each modality but also highlights regions where objects are more likely to appear. our qfdet remarkably boosts the detection performance over tiny and small objects, surpassing the strong baseline on maptiny 50 by 6.57 points on rgbtdroneperson and maps by 3.80 points on vtuav-det. the datasets, codes, and pre-trained models are available at https://nnnnerd.github.io/rgbtdroneperson/.",AB_0145
"a broad range of prior research has demonstrated that attention mechanisms offer great potential in advancing the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (cnns). however, most existing approaches either ignore modeling attention in both channel and spatial dimensions or introduce higher model complexity and heavier computational burden. to alleviate this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient multidimensional collaborative attention, mca, a novel method for simultaneously inferring attention in channel, height, and width dimensions with almost free additional overhead by using a three-branch architecture. for the essential components of mca, we not only develop an adaptive combination mechanism for merging dual cross-dimension feature responses in squeeze transformation, enhancing the informativeness and discriminability of feature descriptors but also design a gating mechanism in excitation transformation that adaptively determines the coverage of interaction to capture local feature interactions, overcoming the paradox of performance and computational overhead trade-off. our mca is simple yet general and can be easily plugged into various classic cnns as a plug-and-play module and trained along with the vanilla networks in an end-to-end manner. extensive experimental results for image recognition on cifar and imagenet-1k datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art (sota) counterparts. in addition, we also provide insight into the practical benefits of mca by visually inspecting the gradcam++ visualization results. the code is available at https://github.com/ndsclark/mcanet.",AB_0145
"in this paper, we propose a practical three-dimensional (3d) real-scene reconstruction framework named deep3d, which is paired with a deep learning based multi-view stereo (mvs) matching model named the adaptive multi-view aggregation matching (ada-mvs) model, to obtain a 3d textured mesh model from multi view oblique aerial images. deep3d is the first deep learning based framework for 3d scene reconstruction, in which aerial triangulation and view selection are first performed on the input images, and the depth map of each image is then inferred using the pretrained ada-mvs model. all the inferred depth maps are then fused into a dense point cloud after filtering the outliers. finally, the 3d textured mesh is extracted from the dense 3d points as the final product. in the ada-mvs model, a novel adaptive inter-view aggregation module is specially proposed to address the inconsistent information among oblique views and to fuse the multi-view costs into a robust cost volume. a lightweight recurrent regularization module is also designed for high-efficiency processing of high-capacity aerial images with large depth variations. moreover, as oblique aerial image datasets are currently lacking, we built a large-scale synthetic multi-view oblique aerial image dataset (whu-omvs dataset) for deep learning based model training and methodology evaluation for the task of 3d scene reconstruction. the experimental results show that, firstly, the proposed ada-mvs model has obvious advantages when used with high capacity oblique aerial images, compared with several relevant learning-based mvs methods. secondly, through a comprehensive comparison with popular commercial software packages and open-source solutions, it is shown that the proposed deep3d framework outperforms all the other solutions in terms of reconstruction quality, and outperforms all the open-source solutions and some of the software packages in terms of efficiency on the whu-omvs dataset. thirdly, the deep3d framework shows a stable generalization ability and excellent performance when applied to other oblique or nadir aerial images, without any further fine-tuning. the dataset and code will be available at http://gpcv.whu.edu.cn/data.",AB_0145
"reactive oxygen species (ros) are highly reactive molecules that play important roles in microbial biological processes. however, excessive accumulation of ros can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage. microorganism have evolved a diverse suite of enzymes to mitigate the harmful effects of ros. accurate prediction of ros scavenging enzymes classes (roses) is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of oxidative stress and developing strategies to combat related diseases. nevertheless, the existing approaches for categorizing ros-related proteins exhibit certain drawbacks with regards to their precision and inclusiveness. to address this, we propose a new multi-task deep learning framework called roses-finder. this framework integrates three component methods using a voting-based approach to predict multiple roses properties simultaneously. it can identify whether a given protein sequence is a roses and determine its type. the three component methods used in the framework are roses-cnn, which extracts raw sequence encoding features, roses-nn, which predicts protein functions based on sequence information, and roses-xgboost, which performs functional classification using ensemble machine learning. comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our method. roses-finder is freely available at https://github.com/alienn233/roses-finder for predicting roses classes.",AB_0145
"biomedical relation extraction (re) is the task of automatically identifying and characterizing relations between biomedical concepts from free text. re is a central task in biomedical natural language processing (nlp) research and plays a critical role in many downstream applications, such as literature-based discovery and knowledge graph construction. state-of-the-art methods were used primarily to train machine learning models on individual re datasets, such as protein-protein interaction and chemical-induced disease relation. manual dataset annotation, however, is highly expensive and time-consuming, as it requires domain knowledge. existing re datasets are usually domain-specific or small, which limits the development of generalized and high-performing re models. in this work, we present a novel framework for systematically addressing the data heterogeneity of individual datasets and combining them into a large dataset. based on the framework and dataset, we report on biorex, a data-centric approach for extracting relations. our evaluation shows that biorex achieves significantly higher performance than the benchmark system trained on the individual dataset, setting a new sota from 74.4% to 79.6% in f-1 measure on the recently released biored corpus. we further demonstrate that the combined dataset can improve performance for five different re tasks. in addition, we show that on average biorex compares favorably to current best-performing methods such as transfer learning and multi-task learning. finally, we demonstrate biorex's robustness and generalizability in two independent re tasks not previously seen in training data: drug-drug n-ary combination and document-level gene-disease re. the integrated dataset and optimized method have been packaged as a stand-alone tool available at https://github.com/ncbi/biorex.",AB_0145

"backgroundlong term care (ltc) services for functionally impaired senior citizens are crucial for addressing the challenges of aging. however, research on eligibility criteria and coverage of ltc in china is lacking. our objective is to assess the current status of ltc and explore eligibility criteria and coverage for the elderly.methodsthis is a cross-sectional study conducted in two first-tier cities in china. residents aged 65 or over were recruited from a nursing home and four primary hospitals. participants were divided into three groups (bedridden, domestic, and community), then six grades (grade one to six) according to the longshi scale, and their functional ability was assessed using the modified barthel index. information such as diseases, complications, and daily care needs were collected. nursing staff were invited to indicate patients' needs for care. a one-way anova test, kruskal wallis h test and mann-whitney u test were used to explore the differences of variables in three longshi groups or longshi grades.resultsamong all 1157 participants, with an average age of 80.54, 69.3% were in the bedridden group. the most common diagnosis was stroke (71.4%), with the most prevalent complication being pulmonary infection (25.2%). in the nursing assessment, basic health care, disease care, activity care, complication prevention care and psychosocial care were summarized as the five main aspects of ltc for the elderly. feeding, bathing, drinking, bowel management and bladder management were identified as the basic care which fulfills participants' basic physical needs in each longshi group. mouth care, artificial airway management, and body reposition, which can prevent immobility complications, were highly demanded by bedridden elderly.conclusionsthe elderly in grade one to three are the ones in need of ltc most. the content of ltc for elderly should include basic care which fulfills their basic physical needs and complication care which can prevent immobility complications. the evidence of this research may contribute to the design of ltc in china.trial registrationthe study design was registered in the chinese clinical trial registry (chictr-2000034067, registered 22 jun 2020, http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=54770).",AB_0145
"cucumber production in china is declining due to various pathologic diseases, but the technology for plant disease detection is not mature and requires high labor costs. moreover, since planting sites are typically high-density scenes, most photos are shot from various angles with messy backgrounds, resulting in poor classification reliability. in this paper, batches of cucumber leaf image data are collected from agricultural websites and then preprocessed through the image size normalization. a mobile-based recognition algorithm is proposed to identify cucumber diseases from leaf images in natural scenes, enabling farmers to detect diseases more quickly. the proposed algorithm allows farmers to upload cucumber pictures, and rapidly and accurately classify them with high accuracy. with a improved network based on mobilenet v3, the classification of seven kinds of cucumber leaf diseases can be quickly and accurately completed. the network model is achieved by selecting appropriate parameters, optimizers, and batch capacity using the single-variable method. additionally, a new training strategy called the flooding method is applied in the model, replacing the traditional strategy that relies solely on loss decline. an accuracy of 83.3% is achieved on our custom dataset. finally, two public datasets, namely plantvillage and apple disease, are selected for migration experiments. the achieved accuracy rates for these datasets are 99% and 98.1% respectively, demonstrating the universality of the proposed strategy. the code for all the experiments will be made available for reference on the github repository at https://github.com/yiquanmarx/agricultural_diseases_dentification.",AB_0145
