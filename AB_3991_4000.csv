"the interpretation of pathway enrichment analysis results is frequently complicated by an overwhelming and redundant list of significantly affected pathways. here, we present an r package apear (advanced pathway enrichment analysis representation) which leverages similarities between the pathway gene sets and represents them as a network of interconnected clusters. each cluster is assigned a meaningful name that highlights the main biological themes in the experiment. our approach enables an automated and objective overview of the data without manual and time-consuming parameter tweaking. availability and implementation: the package apear is implemented in r, published under the mit open-source licence. the source code, documentation, and usage instructions are available on https://gitlab.com/vugene/apear as well as on cran (https://cran.r-project.org/package=apear).",AB_0400
"background malaria continues to be a major threat to global public health. whole genome sequencing (wgs) of the underlying plasmodium parasites has provided insights into the genomic epidemiology of malaria. genome sequencing is rapidly gaining traction as a diagnostic and surveillance tool for clinical settings, where the profiling of co-infections, identification of imported malaria parasites, and detection of drug resistance are crucial for infection control and disease elimination. to support this informatically, we have developed the malaria-profiler tool, which rapidly (within minutes) predicts plasmodium species, geographical source, and resistance to antimalarial drugs directly from wgs data. results the online and command line versions of malaria-profiler detect similar to 250 markers from genome sequences covering plasmodium speciation, likely geographical source, and resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), and other anti-malarial drugs for p. falciparum, but also providing mutations for orthologous resistance genes in other species. the predictive performance of the mutation library was assessed using 9321 clinical isolates with wgs and geographical data, with most being single-species infections (p. falciparum 7152/7462, p. vivax 1502/1661, p. knowlesi 143/151, p. malariae 18/18, p. ovale ssp. 5/5), but co-infections were identified (456/9321; 4.8%). the accuracy of the predicted geographical profiles was high to both continental (96.1%) and regional levels (94.6%). for p. falciparum, markers were identified for resistance to chloroquine (49.2%; regional range: 24.5% to 100%), sulfadoxine (83.3%; 35.4- 90.5%), pyrimethamine (85.4%; 80.0-100%) and combined sp (77.4%). markers associated with the partial resistance of artemisinin were found in wgs from isolates sourced from southeast asia (30.6%). conclusions malaria-profiler is a user-friendly tool that can rapidly and accurately predict the geographical regional source and anti-malarial drug resistance profiles across large numbers of samples with wgs data. the software is flexible with modifiable bioinformatic pipelines. for example, it is possible to select the sequencing platform, display specific variants, and customise the format of outputs. with the increasing application of next-generation sequencing platforms on plasmodium dna, malaria-profiler has the potential to be integrated into point-of-care and surveillance settings, thereby assisting malaria control. malaria-profiler is available online (bioinformatics.lshtm.ac.uk/malaria-profiler) and as standalone software (https://github.com/jodyphelan/malaria-profiler).",AB_0400
"relaxometry is a field with a glorious and controversial history, and no review will ever do it justice. it is full of egos and inventions, patents and lawsuits, high expectations and deep disillusionments. rather than a paragraph dedicated to each of these, we want to give it an impressionistic overview, painted over with a coat of personal opinions and ruminations about the future of the field. for those unfamiliar with the gartner hype cycle, here's a brief recap. the cycle starts with a technology trigger and goes through a phase of unrealistically inflated expectations. eventually the hype dies down as implementations fail to deliver on their promise, and disillusionment sets in. technologies that manage to live through the trough reach the slope of enlightenment, when there is a flurry of second and third generation products that make the initial promise feel feasible again. finally, we reach the slope of productivity, where mainstream adoption takes off, and more incremental progress is made, eventually reaching steady state in terms of the technology's visibility. the entire interactive timeline can be viewed at https://qmrlab.org/relaxometry/.",AB_0400
"food-drug interactions (fdis) occur when a food item alters the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of a drug. fdis can be clinically relevant, as they can hamper or enhance the therapeutic effects of a drug and impact both their efficacy and their safety. however, knowledge of fdis in clinical practice is limited. this is partially due to the lack of resources focused on fdis. here, we describe foodrugs, a database that centralizes fdi knowledge retrieved from two different approaches: a natural processing language pipeline that extracts potential fdis from scientific documents and clinical trials and a molecular similarity approach based on the comparison of gene expression alterations caused by foods and drugs. foodrugs database stores a total of 3 430 062 potential fdis, with 1 108 429 retrieved from scientific documents and 2 321 633 inferred from molecular data. this resource aims to provide researchers and clinicians with a centralized repository for potential fdi information that is free and easy to use.database url: https://zenodo.org/records/8192515database doi: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6638469",AB_0400
"background recent studies have demonstrated that prehabilitation improves patients' physical fitness but its impact on postoperative morbidity remains unclear. this study aimed to assess the effect of personalized, multimodal, semisupervised, home-based prehabilitation on postoperative complications after surgery for gastric cancer.methods this rct was conducted at two centres in lithuania. patients (aged at least18 years) with gastric cancer scheduled to undergo elective primary surgery or surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer were randomized (1 : 1) to prehabilitation or standard care. prehabilitation included exercise interventions focused on endurance, respiratory muscle strength, stretching, and resistance training as well as nutritional and psychological support. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with postoperative complications within 90 days after surgery. secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality rate, physical condition, fitness level, nutritional status, quality of life, anxiety and depression level, and proportion of patients completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.results between february 2020 and september 2022, 128 participants were randomized to prehabilitation (64) or standard care (64), and 122 (prehabilitation 61, control 61) were analysed. the prehabilitation group had increased physical capacity before the operation compared with baseline (mean 6-min walk test change +31 (95 per cent c.i. 14 to 48) m; p = 0.001). the prehabilitation group had a decreased rate of non-compliance with neoadjuvant treatment (risk ratio (rr) 0.20, 95 per cent c.i. 0.20 to 0.56), a 60 per cent reduction in the number of patients with postoperative complications at 90 days after surgery (rr 0.40, 0.24 to 0.66), and improved quality of life compared with the control group.conclusion prehabilitation reduced morbidity in patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer.registration number nct04223401 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). this rct investigated the effect of personalized, multimodal, home-based prehabilitation on 90-day postoperative complications after gastric cancer surgery. prehabilitation was shown to increase patients' physical capacity, decrease the rate of non-compliance with neoadjuvant treatment, reduce the postoperative complication rate by 60 per cent, and improve quality of life.",AB_0400
"global change is predicted to induce shifts in anuran acoustic behavior, which can be studied through passive acoustic monitoring (pam). understanding changes in calling behavior requires automatic identification of anuran species, which is challenging due to the particular characteristics of neotropical soundscapes. in this paper, we introduce a large-scale multi-species dataset of anuran amphibians calls recorded by pam, that comprises 27 hours of expert annotations for 42 different species from two brazilian biomes. we provide open access to the dataset, including the raw recordings, experimental setup code, and a benchmark with a baseline model of the fine-grained categorization problem. additionally, we highlight the challenges of the dataset to encourage machine learning researchers to solve the problem of anuran call identification towards conservation policy. all our experiments and resources have been made available at https://soundclim.github.io/anuraweb/.",AB_0400
"introductionthe practice of creating large databases has become increasingly common by combining research participants' data into larger repositories. funders now require that data sharing be considered in newly funded research project, unless there are justifiable reasons not to do so. access to genomic data brings along a host of ethical concerns as well as fairness and equity in the conduct of collaborative research between researchers from high- income and low-and middle-income countries.materials and methodsthis systematic review protocol will be developed in line with prisma -guidelines which refers to open science framework, registered in prospero (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) record crd42022297984 and published in a peer reviewed journal. data sources will include pubmed, google scholar, embase, web of science and medline. both published and grey literature will be searched. subject matter experts including bioethicists, principal investigators of genomic research projects and research administrators will be contacted. after de-duplication, titles and abstracts will be screened for eligibility. data extraction will be undertaken using a piloted form designed in eppi-reviewer software before conducting risk of bias assessments by a pair of reviewers, acting independently. any discrepancies will be resolved by consensus. analysis will be done using a structured narrative synthesis and where feasible metanalysis. this review will attempt to highlight the context of data sharing practices in the global north-south and south-south collaborative human genomic research in low- and middle-income countries. this review will enhance the body of evidence on ethical, legal and social implications of data sharing in international collaborative genomic research setting criteria for data sharing. the full report will be shared with relevant stakeholders including universities, civil society, funders, and departments of genomic research to ensure an adequate reach in low-and middle-income countries (lmics).",AB_0400
"chronic inflammatory diseases (cids), including inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) are thought to emerge from an impaired complex network of inter- and intracellular biochemical interactions among several proteins and small chemical compounds under strong influence of genetic and environmental factors. cids are characterised by shared and disease-specific processes, which is reflected by partially overlapping genetic risk maps and pathogenic cells (e.g., t cells). their pathogenesis involves a plethora of intracellular pathways. the translation of the research findings on cids molecular mechanisms into effective treatments is challenging and may explain the low remission rates despite modern targeted therapies. modelling cid-related causal interactions as networks allows us to tackle the complexity at a systems level and improve our understanding of the interplay of key pathways. here we report the construction, description, and initial applications of the syscid map (https://syscid.elixir-luxembourg.org/), a mechanistic causal interaction network covering the molecular crosstalk between ibd, ra and sle. we demonstrate that the map serves as an interactive, graphical review of ibd, ra and sle molecular mechanisms, and helps to understand the complexity of omics data. examples of such application are illustrated using transcriptome data from time-series gene expression profiles following anti-tnf treatment and data from genome-wide associations studies that enable us to suggest potential effects to altered pathways and propose possible mechanistic biomarkers of treatment response.",AB_0400
"background covid-19 and antimicrobial resistance (amr) are two intersecting public health crises. antimicrobial overuse in patients with covid-19 threatens to worsen amr. guidelines are fundamental in encouraging antimicrobial stewardship. we sought to assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing guidelines and recommendations in the context of covid-19, and whether they incorporate principles of antimicrobial stewardship. methods we performed a systematic survey which included a search using the concepts antibiotic/antimicrobial up to november 15, 2022 of the ecovid-19 living map of recommendations (recmap) which aggregates guidelines across a range of international sources and all languages. guidelines providing explicit recommendations regarding antibacterial use in covid-19 were eligible for inclusion. guideline and recommendation quality were assessed using the agree ii and agree-rex instruments, respectively. we extracted guideline characteristics including panel representation and the presence or absence of explicit statements related to antimicrobial stewardship (i.e., judicious antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance or adverse effects as a consequence of antibiotic use). we used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between guideline characteristics including quality and incorporation of antimicrobial stewardship principles. protocol registration (osf): https://osf.io/4pgtc. findings twenty-eight guidelines with 63 antibiotic prescribing recommendations were included. recommendations focused on antibiotic initiation (n = 52, 83%) and less commonly antibiotic selection (n = 13, 21%), and duration of therapy (n = 15, 24%). guideline and recommendation quality varied widely. twenty (71%) guidelines incorporated at least one concept relating to antimicrobial stewardship. including infectious diseases expertise on the guideline panel (or 9.44, 97.5% ci: 1.09-81.59) and agree-rex score (or 3.26, 97.5% ci: 1.14-9.31 per 10% increase in overall score) were associated with a higher odds of guidelines addressing antimicrobial stewardship. interpretation there is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing guidelines in terms of both quality and incorporation of antimicrobial stewardship principles. these findings can help guideline developers better address antibiotic stewardship in future recommendations beyond covid-19.",AB_0400
"convolutional- and transformer-based backbone architecture are two dominant, widely accepted, models in computer vision. nevertheless, it is still a challenge, thus a focus of research, to decide which backbone architecture performs better, and under which circumstances. in this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the differences of the macroscopic backbone design of the cnn and transformer models with the ultimate purpose of developing new models to combine the strengths of both types of architectures for effective image classification. specifically, we first analyze the model structures of both models and identified four main differences, then we design four sets of ablation experiments using the imagenet-1k dataset with an image classification problem as an example to study the impacts of these four differences on model performance. based on the experimental results, we derive four observations as rules of thumb for designing a vision model backbone architecture. informed by the experiment findings, we then conceive a novel model called cmnet which marries the experiment-proved best design practices of cnn and transformer architectures. finally, we carry out extensive experiments on cmnet using the same dataset against baseline classifiers. initial results prove cmnet achieves the highest top-1 accuracy of 80.08% on the imagenet-1k validation set, this is a very competitive value compared to previous classical models with similar computational complexity. details of the implementation, algorithms and codes, are publicly available on github: https://github.com/arwin-yu/cmnet.",AB_0400
