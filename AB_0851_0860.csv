"existing convolutional neural network (cnn) based anomaly detection and segmentation approaches are overly sensitive or not sensitive enough to noise, resulting in anomaly patterns, partially detected in the testing stage. the previous methods may also differentiate normal and abnormal images, but they cannot identify the location of anomaly presented in test images with high accuracy. to address this issue, we propose a two-stage cnn model for coarse-to-fine anomaly segmentation and detection called (tasad). in both stages of tasad, we train our model on a mixture of normal and abnormal training samples. the abnormal images are obtained by inserting pseudo-anomaly patterns that are automatically generated from anomaly source images. we use a novel and sophisticated anomaly insertion technique to generate various anomalous samples. in the first stage, we design a coarse anomaly segmentation (cas) model that takes a whole image as an input, while in the second stage, we train a fine anomaly segmentation (fas) model on image patches. fas model improves detection and segmentation performance by refining anomaly patterns partially detected by cas model. we train our framework on mvtec dataset and compare it with state-of-the-art (sota) methods. the proposed architecture leads to a compact model size - four times smaller than the sota method, while exhibiting better pixel-level accuracy. tasad can also be applied to sotas to further improve their anomaly detection performance. our experiments demonstrate that when applied to the latest sotas, tasad improves the average precision (ap) performance of previous methods by 6.2%. for reproducibility of the results, code is provided at https://github.com/riz wanaliqau/tasad.git.",AB_0086
"in order to identify emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfass) and their alternatives in the environment or population, we need to perform extensive profiling of pfass to determine their distribution in samples. the sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (swath mode) is capable of obtaining a wide range of ms2 spectra but is difficult for direct identification of pfass due to its complex ms2 spectra, and the nontarget screening method is difficult to identify due to its lack of a priori information. in this study, we demonstrated the great potential of swath-f, a nontarget fragment-based homologue screening method in combination with the swath-ms deconvolution, for detecting pfass. we evaluated the application of swath-f to gradient spiked samples and real population serum samples, compared it with nontarget homologue screening in the information-dependent acquisition mode (ida mode), and obtained better results for swath-f with 276% improvement (ida:17 pfass, swath-f: 64 pfass) in identification. in addition, we automated the screening and identification process of swath-f to facilitate its use by researchers. swath-f is freely available on github (https://github.com/njuirene/swath-f) under an mit license.",AB_0086
"outcomes after myocardial infarction in women remain poor. the number of cardiovascular risk factors in women increase with age, however the relation between risk factors and cul-prit plaque characteristics in this population is poorly understood. the aim of the study was to investigate the relation between risk factors and culprit plaque characteristics in women with acute coronary syndrome (acs). a total of 382 women who presented with acs and underwent pre-intervention optical coherence tomography imaging of the culprit lesion were included in this analysis. the culprit plaques were categorized as plaque rupture, plaque ero-sion or calcified plaque, and then stratified by age and risk factors. the predominant pathol-ogy of acs was plaque erosion in young patients (<60 years), which decreased with age (p <0.001). current smokers had a high prevalence of plaque rupture (60%) and lipid plaque (79%). women with diabetes tended to have more lipid plaque (70%) even at a young age. in women with hyperlipidemia, the prevalence of lipid plaques was modest in younger ages, but rose gradually with age (p <0.001). an increasing age trend for lipid plaque was also observed in women with hypertension (p = 0.03) and current smokers (p = 0.01). in conclu-sion, early treatment of risk factors such as diabetes in young women might be important before accelerated progression of atherosclerosis begins as age advances. clinical trial regis-tration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, nct01110538, nct03479723 and nct02041650 (c) 2023 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0086
"motivation dna-based data storage is one of the most attractive research areas for future archival storage. however, it faces the problems of high writing and reading costs for practical use. there have been many efforts to resolve this problem, but existing schemes are not fully suitable for dna-based data storage, and more cost reduction is needed.results we propose whole encoding and decoding procedures for dna storage. the encoding procedure consists of a carefully designed single low-density parity-check code as an inter-oligo code, which corrects errors and dropouts efficiently. we apply new clustering and alignment methods that operate on variable-length reads to aid the decoding performance. we use edit distance and quality scores during the sequence analysis-aided decoding procedure, which can discard abnormal reads and utilize high-quality soft information. we store 548.83 kb of an image file in dna oligos and achieve a writing cost reduction of 7.46% and a significant reading cost reduction of 26.57% and 19.41% compared with the two previous works.availability and implementation data and codes for all the algorithms proposed in this study are available at: https://github.com/sjpark0905/dna-ldpc-codes.",AB_0086
"growing regulatory requirements set barriers around genetic data sharing and collaborations. moreover, existing privacy-aware paradigms are challenging to deploy in collaborative settings. we present collagene, a tool base for building secure collaborative genomic data analysis methods. collagene protects data using shared-key homomorphic encryption and combines encryption with multiparty strategies for efficient privacy-aware collaborative method development. collagene provides ready-to-run tools for encryption/decryption, matrix processing, and network transfers, which can be immediately integrated into existing pipelines. we demonstrate the usage of collagene by building a practical federated gwas protocol for binary phenotypes and a secure meta-analysis protocol. collagene is available at https://zenodo.org/record/8125935.",AB_0086
"graph neural networks (gnns) have been successfully applied to graph-level tasks in various fields such as biology, social networks, computer vision, and natural language processing. for the graph level representations learning of gnns, graph pooling plays an essential role. among many pooling techniques, node drop pooling has garnered significant attention and is considered as a leading approach. however, existing node drop pooling methods, which typically retain the top-k nodes based on their significance scores, often overlook the diversity inherent in node features and graph structures. this limitation leads to suboptimal graph-level representations. to overcome this, we introduce a groundbreaking plug-and-play score scheme, termed mid. mid comprises a multidimensional score space and two key operations: flipscore and dropscore. the multidimensional score space depicts the significance of nodes by multiple criteria; the flipscore process promotes the preservation of distinct node features; the dropscore compels the model to take into account a range of graph structures rather than focusing on local structures. to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mid, we have conducted extensive experiments by integrating it with a broad range of recent node drop pooling methods, such as topkpool, sagpool, gsapool, and asap. in particular, mid has proven to bring a significant average improvement of approximately 2.8% over the four aforementioned methods when tested on 17 real-world graph classification datasets. code is available at https://github.com/ whuchuang/mid.(c) 2023 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0086
"motivation neighbour-joining is one of the most widely used distance-based phylogenetic inference methods. however, current implementations do not scale well for datasets with more than 10 000 sequences. given the increasing pace of generating new sequence data, particularly in outbreaks of emerging diseases, and the already enormous existing databases of sequence data for which neighbour-joining is a useful approach, new implementations of existing methods are warranted.results here, we present decenttree, which provides highly optimized and parallel implementations of neighbour-joining and several of its variants. decenttree is designed as a stand-alone application and a header-only library easily integrated with other phylogenetic software (e.g. it is integral in the popular iq-tree software). we show that decenttree shows similar or improved performance over existing software (bionj, quicktree, fastme, and rapidnj), especially for handling very large alignments. for example, decenttree is up to 6-fold faster than the fastest existing neighbour-joining software (e.g. rapidnj) when generating a tree of 64 000 sars-cov-2 genomes.availability and implementation decenttree is open source and freely available at https://github.com/iqtree/decenttree. all code and data used in this analysis are available on github (https://github.com/asdcid/comparison-of-neighbour-joining-software).",AB_0086
"in recent years, the field of computational drug design has made significant strides in the development of artificial intelligence (ai) models for the generation of de novo chemical compounds with desired properties and biological activities, such as enhanced binding affinity to target proteins. these high-affinity compounds have the potential to be developed into more potent therapeutics for a broad spectrum of diseases. due to the lack of data required for the training of deep generative models, however, some of these approaches have fine-tuned their molecular generators using data obtained from a separate predictor. while these studies show that generative models can produce structures with the desired target properties, it remains unclear whether the diversity of the generated structures and the span of their chemical space align with the distribution of the intended target molecules. in this study, we present a novel generative framework, logics, a framework for learning optimal generative distribution iteratively for designing target-focused chemical structures. we address the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which weighs the choice between exploring new options and exploiting current knowledge. to tackle this issue, we incorporate experience memory and employ a layered tournament selection approach to refine the fine-tuning process. the proposed method was applied to the binding affinity optimization of two target proteins of different protein classes, & kappa;-opioid receptors, and pik3ca, and the quality and the distribution of the generative molecules were evaluated. the results showed that logics outperforms competing state-of-the-art models and generates more diverse de novo chemical structures with optimized properties. the source code is available at the github repository (https://github.com/gist-csbl/logics).",AB_0086
"background: an optimal strategy for left atrial ablation in addition to pulmonary vein isolation (pvi) in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (af) has not been determined. methods and results: we conducted an extended follow-up of the multicenter randomized controlled earnest-pvi (efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation alone in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation) trial, which compared 12-month rhythm outcomes in patients with persistent af between patients randomized to a pvi-alone strategy (n=248) or pvi-plus strategy (n=248; pvi followed by left atrial additional ablation, including linear ablation or ablation targeting areas with complex fractionated electrograms). the present study extended the follow-up period to 3 years after enrollment. outcomes were compared not only between randomly allocated groups but also between on-treatment groups categorized by actually created ablation lesions. recurrence rate of af or atrial tachycardia (at) was lower in the randomly allocated to pvi-plus group than the pvi-alone group (29.0% versus 37.5%, p=0.036). on-treatment analysis revealed that patients with pvi+linear ablation (n=205) demonstrated a lower af/at recurrence rate than those with pvi only (26.3% versus 37.8%, p=0.007). in contrast, patients with pvi+complex fractionated electrograms ablation (n=37) had an af/at recurrence rate comparable to that of patients with pvi only (40.5% versus 37.8%, p= 0.76). at second ablation in 126 patients with af/at recurrence, ats excluding common atrial flutter were more frequent in patients with pvi+linear ablation than in those with pvi only (32.6% versus 5.7%, p<0.0001). conclusions: left atrial ablation in addition to pvi was efficacious during 3-year follow-up. linear ablation was superior to other ablation strategies but may increase iatrogenic ats. registration: url: http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index-j. htm; unique identifier: umin000019449.",AB_0086
"backgroundin patients with cardiogenic shock (cs), acute myocardial infarction (ami) is the most common cause, and a percutaneous microaxial ventricular assist device (impella, abiomed, danvers, ma) is a choice for temporary mechanical circulatory support. however, data are limited on complications and outcomes of impella treatment in patients with cs with and without ami.methods and resultsusing nationwide prospective registry data in japan, we included a total of 2047 patients with cs in whom the impella devices were successfully placed between february 2020 and december 2021. patients were divided into 2 groups according to the primary indication for the impella use: ami versus non-ami. the primary end point was a composite of in-hospital all-cause death and major complications. of the 2047 patients, the impella was indicated for ami in 1337 (65.3%). in the group without ami, myocarditis was the leading cause of cs. patients with ami-cs were older and more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors than those with non-ami-cs. the rates of in-hospital mortality (46.0% versus 43.9%, p=0.38) and major complications (35.2% versus 34.7%, p=0.85) were similar between the 2 groups. overall, multivariable analysis identified older age, higher body mass index, previous transient ischemic attack or stroke, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and the impella 5.0 as factors significantly associated with the primary end point.conclusionsthe use of impella in patients with and without ami was related to similar clinical outcomes with high mortality and complication rates. further studies are needed to identify patients who may benefit from the impella devices in cs.registrationurl: https://www.umin.ac.jp/english. identifier: umin000033603.",AB_0086
