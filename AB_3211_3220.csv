"differentiable architecture search (darts) is an effective neural architecture search algorithm based on gradient descent. however, there are two limitations in darts. first, a small proxy search space is exploited due to memory and computational resource constraints. second, too many simple operations are preferred, which leads to the network deterioration. in this paper, we propose a uniform-space differentiable architecture search, named u-darts, to address the above problems. in one hand, the search space is redesigned to enable the search and evaluation of the architectures in the same space, and the new search space couples with a sampling and parameter sharing strategy to reduce resource overheads. this means that various cell structures are explored directly rather than cells with same structure are stacked to compose the network. in another hand, a regularization method, which takes the depth and the complexity of the operations into account, is proposed to prevent network deterioration. our experiments show that u-darts is able to find excellent architectures. specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.59% with 3.3m parameters on cifar-10. the code is released in https://github .com /sun -shiqi /u -darts.",AB_0322
"time series modeling has attracted great research interests in the last decades. among the literature, shapelet-based models aim to extract representative subsequences, and could offer explanatory insights in the downstream tasks. but most of those works ignore the seasonal effects on the subsequences, as well as the evolutionary characteristics of shapelets. in order to capture the shapelet dynamics and evolutions, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of bridging time series representation learning and graph modeling, with two different implementations. we first formulate the process of extracting time-aware shapelets by directly adding time-level attentions, then introduce the key idea of transforming time series data into shapelet evolution graphs, to model the shapelet evolutionary patterns. a straightforward solution is to enumerate all possible shapelet transitions among adjacent time series segments, and apply a random-walk-based graph embedding algorithm to learn time series representations (time2graph). we further extend time2graph by adopting graph attention mechanism to refine the procedure of modeling shapelet evolutions, namely time2graph+. specifically, we transform each time series data into a unique unweighted shapelet graph, and use gat to automatically capture the correlations between shapelets. experimental results on three real-world datasets show the significant improvements of time2graph+ over time2graph and 17 baseline methods, and observational analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and interpretability brought by both time-level and graph-level attentions. furthermore, the success of online deployment of time2graph+ model in state grid of china validates the whole framework in the real-world application. codes and documentations are available at https://github.com/petecheng/time2graphplus.",AB_0322
"the 3-d position estimation of pedestrians is a vital module to build the connections between persons and things. the traditional gait model-based methods cannot fulfill the various motion patterns. and the various data-driven-based inertial odometry solutions focus on the 2-d trajectory estimation on the ground plane, which is not suitable for augmented reality (ar) applications. tight learned inertial odometry (tlio) proposed an inertial-based 3-d motion estimator that achieves very low position drift by using the raw inertial measurement unit (imu) measurements and the displacement prediction coming from a neural network to provide low drift pedestrian dead reckoning. however, tlio is unsuitable for mobile devices because it is computationally expensive. in this article, a lightweight learned inertial odometry network (llio-net) is designed for mobile devices. by replacing the network in tlio with the llio-net, the proposed system shows a similar level of accuracy but remarkable efficiency improvement. specifically, the proposed llio algorithm was implemented on mobile devices and compared the computational efficiency with tlio. the inference efficiency of the proposed system is up to 12 times improved than that of tlio. source code can be found on https://github.com/i2nav-whu/lightweightlearnedinertialodometergithub.",AB_0322
"in recent years, a large number of studies have shown that the subcellular localization of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) can bring crucial information to the recognition of lncrnas function. therefore, it is of great significance to establish a computational method to accurately predict the subcellular localization of lncrna. previous prediction models are based on low-level sequences information and are troubled by the few samples problem. in this study, we propose a new prediction model, gm-lncloc, which is based on the initial information extracted from the lncrna sequence, and also combines the graph structure information to extract high level features of lncrna. in addition, the training mode of meta-learning is introduced to obtain meta-parameters by training a series of tasks. with the meta-parameters, the final parameters of other similar tasks can be learned quickly, so as to solve the problem of few samples in lncrna subcellular localization. compared with the previous methods, gm-lncloc achieved the best results with an accuracy of 93.4 and 94.2% in the benchmark datasets of 5 and 4 subcellular compartments, respectively. furthermore, the prediction performance of gm-lncloc was also better on the independent dataset. it shows the effectiveness and great potential of our proposed method for lncrna subcellular localization prediction. the datasets and source code are freely available at https://github.com/junzhecai/gm-lncloc.",AB_0322
"clustering is an important data analysis technique. however, due to the diversity of datasets, each clustering algorithm is unable to produce satisfactory results on some particular datasets. in this paper, we propose a clustering optimization method called hiac (highly improving the accuracy of clustering algorithms). by introducing gravitation, hiac forces objects in the dataset to move towards similar objects, making the ameliorated dataset more friendly to clustering algorithms (i. e., clustering algorithms can produce more accurate results on the ameliorated dataset). hiac is independent of clustering principle, so it can optimize different clustering algorithms. in contrast to other similar methods, hiac is the first to adopt the selective-addition mechanism, i.e., only adding gravitation between valid-neighbors, to avoid dissimilar objects approaching each other. in order to identify valid-neighbors from neighbors, hiac introduces a decision graph, from which the naked eye can observe a clear division threshold. additionally, the decision graph can assist hiac in reducing the negative effects that improper parameter values have on optimization. we conducted numerous experiments to test hiac. experiment results show that hiac can effectively ameliorate high-dimensional datasets, gaussian datasets, shape datasets, the datasets with outliers, and overlapping datasets. hiac greatly improves the accuracy of clustering algorithms, and its improvement rates are far higher than that of similar methods. the average improvement rate is as high as 253.6% (except maximum and minimum). moreover, its runtime is significantly shorter than that of most similar methods. more importantly, with different parameter values, the advantages of hiac over similar methods are always maintained. the code of hiac is available at https://github.com/qiqi12/hiac.",AB_0322
"open-set recognition aims to deal with unknown classes that do not exist in the training phase. the key is to learn effective latent feature representations for classifying the already known classes as well as detecting new emerging ones. in this paper, we learn multiple gaussian pro-totypes to better represent the complex classes distribution in both generative and discriminative ways. with the generative constraint, the latent variables of the same class clusters compactly around the corresponding gaussian prototypes, preserving extra space for the samples of un-known classes. the discriminative constraint separates the gaussian prototypes of different classes, which further improves the discrimination capability for the known classes. importantly, the entire framework can be directly derived from the bayesian inference, thus providing theo-retical support for open-set recognition. experimental results of different datasets verify the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method. our code is available at: https://github. com/liujmzzz/mgpl.",AB_0322
"rna structure plays a crucial role in gene regulation, in rna stability and the essential biological processes. rna secondary structure (rss) motifs are the basic building blocks for investigating the biological mechanisms of structure. here, we present a strategy for structural motif-based dynamic alignment, namely, rna secondary-structural motif-comparing (rnasmc), to identify structural motifs and quantitatively evaluate their underlying molecular functions. rnasmc also has strong robustness to sequence length, folding protocol and rna structural profile by chemical probing. notably, it is also applicable to quantify structural variation in special rna editing events (snvs or snps, fragment insertion or deletion, etc.). the findings indicate that rnasmc can uncover the heterogeneity of rna secondary structure and score for similarities among components, which provides an impetus to cluster rna families and evaluate allosteric effects. we find that rnasmc exhibits remarkable detection efficiency for experimentally-derived ribosnitches. finally, the pipeline was assembled into an r software package to serve as an automated toolkit to explore, align, and cluster rss. it is freely available for download at https://cran.r-project.org/ package=rnasmc.

"flood events are often accompanied by rainy weather, which limits the applicability of optical satellite images, whereas synthetic aperture radar (sar) is less sensitive to weather and sunlight conditions. although remarkable progress has been made in flood detection using heterogeneous multispectral and sar images, there is a lack of publicly available large-scale datasets and more efforts are required for exploiting deep neural networks in heterogeneous flood detection. this study constructed a pre-disaster sentinel-2 and post-disaster sentinel-1 heterogeneous flood mapping dataset named cau-flood containing 18 study plots with careful image pre-processing and human annotation. a new deep convolutional neural network (cnn), named cross-modal change detection network (cmcdnet), was also proposed for flood detection using multispectral and sar images. the proposed network employs a encoder-decoder structure and performs feature fusion at multiple stages using gating and self-attention modules. furthermore, the network overcomes the feature misalignment issue during decoding by embedding a feature alignment module in the upsampling operation. the proposed cmcdnet outperformed sota methods in terms of flood detection accuracy and achieved an intersection over union (iou) of 89.84%. the codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/cau-he/cmcdnet.",AB_0322
"domain adaptation is the ability to improve the learning efficiency of the target domain by using the prior knowledge of the source domain. when applied to new tasks in the target domain, the performance of domain adaptation trained in the source domain declines sharply. the purpose is to realize a new retrieval task in the target domain using only a small number of labelled data samples, with the aid of the prior knowledge learned in the source domain. this paper focuses on semi-supervised domain adaptation in remote sensing image retrieval. the contributions of this paper are threefold. first, we construct gabor-based cnns to facilitate the networks to effectively capture the texture information of images. second, we propose a cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy based on dual gabor neural network learning. third, we propose an unsupervised random feature mapping method based on probability distance. a large number of experiments have been conducted on ucm, whu-rs, rsscn7, aid, and patternnet datasets. the results show that this method greatly improves the retrieval accuracy on the target domain and obtains state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy. the source code is available at http://nave.vr3i.com.",AB_0322
"as an internal modification of transcripts, rna methylation determines rna fate by changing rna-protein binding affinity. in plants, rna methylation is ubiquitous and is involved in all aspects of rna post-transcriptional regulation. for instance, long-distance mobile rnas, strongly influenced by their methylation status, play important roles in plant growth, development and environmental adaptation. cucumber/ pumpkin heterografts are widely used to improve stress tolerance of cucumber and to study mobile rna signals due to their strong developed vasculature system. here, we developed the cucume (cucurbit rna methylation, http://cucume.cn/) database for these two important vegetables, cucumber (cucumis sativus l.) and pumpkin (cucurbita moschata) with high productivity worldwide. we identified mrnas harboring 5methylcytosine (m5c) and n6-methyladenosine (m6a) sites in pumpkin and cucumber at the whole genome level via methylated rna immunoprecipitation sequencing (merip-seq) of different tissues and the vascular exudates. in addition to rna methylation sites, the cucume database includes graft-transmissible systemic mrnas identified in previous studies using cucumber/pumpkin heterografts. the further integration of cucumber genome-wide association analysis (gwas) and quantitative trait loci (qtl) allows the study of rna methylation-related genetic and epigenetic regulation in cucurbits. therefore, the here developed cucume database will promote understanding the role of cucurbit rna methylation in rna mobility and qtl, ultimately benefitting future breeding of agronomic crop germplasms.(c) 2023 china agricultural university. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0322
