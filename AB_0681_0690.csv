"despite over two decades of progress, imbalanced data is still considered a significant challenge for contemporary machine learning models. modern advances in deep learning have further magnified the importance of the imbalanced data problem, especially when learning from images. therefore, there is a need for an oversampling method that is specifically tailored to deep learning models, can work on raw images while preserving their properties, and is capable of generating high-quality, artificial images that can enhance minority classes and balance the training set. we propose deep synthetic minority oversampling technique (smote), a novel oversampling algorithm for deep learning models that leverages the properties of the successful smote algorithm. it is simple, yet effective in its design. it consists of three major components: 1) an encoder/decoder framework; 2) smote-based oversampling; and 3) a dedicated loss function that is enhanced with a penalty term. an important advantage of deepsmote over generative adversarial network (gan)-based oversampling is that deepsmote does not require a discriminator, and it generates high-quality artificial images that are both information-rich and suitable for visual inspection. deepsmote code is publicly available at https://github.com/dd1github/deepsmote.",AB_0069
"nonnegative matrix factorization (nmf) is widely used to analyze high-dimensional count data because, in contrast to real-valued alternatives such as factor analysis, it produces an interpretable parts-based representation. however, in applications such as spatial transcriptomics, nmf fails to incorporate known structure between observations. here, we present nonnegative spatial factorization (nsf), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on transformed gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity and scales to tens of thousands of observations. nsf recovers ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued alternatives such as mefisto in simulations, and has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic nmf on three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver. since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of nsf that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features. a tensorflow implementation of nsf is available from https://github.com/willtownes/nsf-paper.",AB_0069
"protein structure defines protein function and plays an extremely important role in protein characterization. recently, two groups of researchers from deepmind and the baker lab have independently published protein structure prediction tools that can help us obtain predicted protein structures for the whole human proteome. this enabled us to visualize the entire human proteome using predicted 3d structures for the first time. to help other researchers best utilize these protein structure predictions in proteomics experiments, we present the sequence coverage visualizer (scv), http://scv.lab.gy, a web application for protein sequence coverage 3d visualization. here we showed a few possible usages of the scv, including the labeling of post-translational modifications and isotope labeling experiments. these results highlight the usefulness of such 3d visualization for proteomics experiments and how scv can turn a regular proteomics experiment (identified peptide list) into structural insights. furthermore, when used together with limited proteolysis, we demonstrated that scv can help to compare different protein structures from different sources, including predicted ones and existing pdb entries. we hope our tool can provide help in the process of improving protein structure prediction accuracy. overall, scv is a convenient and powerful tool for visualizing proteomics results in 3d.",AB_0069
"nlm's conserved domain database (cdd) is a collection of protein domain and protein family models constructed as multiple sequence alignments. its main purpose is to provide annotation for protein and translated nucleotide sequences with the location of domain footprints and associated functional sites, and to define protein domain architecture as a basis for assigning gene product names and putative/predicted function. cdd has been available publicly for over 20 years and has grown substantially during that time. maintaining an archive of pre-computed annotation continues to be a challenge and has slowed down the cadence of cdd releases. cdd curation staff builds hierarchical classifications of large protein domain families, adds models for novel domain families via surveillance of the protein 'dark matter' that currently lacks annotation, and now spends considerable effort on providing names and attribution for conserved domain architectures. cdd can be accessed at https://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/structure/cdd/cdd.shtml.",AB_0069
"carbohydrate active enzymes (cazymes) are significantly important for microbial communities to thrive in carbohydrate rich environments such as animal guts, agricultural soils, forest floors, and ocean sediments. since 2017, microbiome sequencing and assembly have produced numerous metagenome assembled genomes (mags). we have updated our dbcan-seq database (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbcan_seq) to include the following new data and features: (i) similar to 498 000 cazymes and similar to 169 000 cazyme gene clusters (cgcs) from 9421 mags of four ecological (human gut, human oral, cow rumen, and marine) environments; (ii) glycan substrates for 41 447 (24.54%) cgcs inferred by two novel approaches (dbcan-pul homology search and ecami subfamily majority voting) (the two approaches agreed on 4183 cgcs for substrate assignments); (iii) a redesigned cgc page to include the graphical display of cgc gene compositions, the alignment of query cgc and subject pul (polysaccharide utilization loci) of dbcan-pul, and the ecami subfamily table to support the predicted substrates; (iv) a statistics page to organize all the data for easy cgc access according to substrates and taxonomic phyla; and (v) a batch download page. in summary, this updated dbcan-seq database highlights glycan substrates predicted for cgcs from microbiomes. future work will implement the substrate prediction function in our dbcan2 web server.",AB_0069
"uncultivated bacteria and archaea account for the vast majority of species on earth, but obtaining their genomes directly from the environment, using shotgun sequencing, has only become possible recently. to realize the hope of capturing earth's microbial genetic complement and to facilitate the investigation of the functional roles of specific lineages in a given ecosystem, technologies that accelerate the recovery of high-quality genomes are necessary. we present a series of analysis steps and data products for the extraction of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (mags) from microbiomes using the u.s. department of energy systems biology knowledgebase (kbase) platform (http://www.kbase.us/). overall, these steps take about a day to obtain extracted genomes when starting from smaller environmental shotgun read libraries, or up to about a week from larger libraries. in kbase, the process is end-to-end, allowing a user to go from the initial sequencing reads all the way through to mags, which can then be analyzed with other kbase capabilities such as phylogenetic placement, functional assignment, metabolic modeling, pangenome functional profiling, rna-seq and others. while portions of such capabilities are available individually from other resources, the combination of the intuitive usability, data interoperability and integration of tools in a freely available computational resource makes kbase a powerful platform for obtaining mags from microbiomes. while this workflow offers tools for each of the key steps in the genome extraction process, it also provides a scaffold that can be easily extended with additional mag recovery and analysis tools, via the kbase software development kit (sdk).",AB_0069
"litcovid (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirusi)-first launched in february 2020-is a first-of-its-kind literature hub for tracking up-to-date published research on covid-19. the number of articles in litcovid has increased from 55 000 to similar to 300 000 over the past 2.5 years, with a consistent growth rate of similar to 10 000 articles per month. in addition to the rapid literature growth, the covid-19 pandemic has evolved dramatically. for instance, the omicron variant has now accounted for over 98% of new infections in the united states. in response to the continuing evolution of the covid-19 pandemic, this article describes significant updates to litcovid over the last 2 years. first, we introduced the long covid collection consisting of the articles on covid-19 survivors experiencing ongoing multisystemic symptoms, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and profound fatigue. second, we provided new annotations on the latest covid-19 strains and vaccines mentioned in the literature. third, we improved several existing features with more accurate machine learning algorithms for annotating topics and classifying articles relevant to covid-19. litcovid has been widely used with millions of accesses by users worldwide on various information needs and continues to play a critical role in collecting, curating and standardizing the latest knowledge on the covid-19 literature.",AB_0069
"trna-derived fragments (trfs) are a class of emerging post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression likely binding to the transcripts of target genes. however, only a few trfs targets have been experimentally validated, making it hard to extrapolate the functions or binding mechanisms of trfs. the paucity of resources supporting the identification of the targets of trfs creates a bottleneck in the fast-developing field. we have previously analyzed chimeric reads in crosslinked argonaute1-rna complexes to help infer the guide-target pairs and binding mechanisms of multiple trfs based on experimental data in human hek293 cells. to efficiently disseminate these results to the research community, we designed a web-based database tatdb (targets of trfs database) populated with close to 250 000 experimentally determined guide-target pairs with similar to 23 000 trf isoforms. tatdb has a user-friendly interface with flexible query options/filters allowing one to obtain comprehensive information on given trfs (or targets). modes of interactions are supported by secondary structures of potential guide-target hybrids and binding motifs, essential for understanding the targeting mechanisms of trfs. further, we illustrate the value of the database on an example of hypothesis-building for a trfs potentially involved in the lifecycle of the sars-cov-2 virus. tatdb is freely accessible at https:// grigoriev-lab.camden. rutgers.edu/tatdb..",AB_0069
