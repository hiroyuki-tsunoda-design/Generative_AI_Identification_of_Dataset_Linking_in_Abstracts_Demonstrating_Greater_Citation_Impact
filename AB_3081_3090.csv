"crop diseases can have a detrimental impact on crop growth, resulting in a significant reduction in crop yield. therefore, accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for enhancing crop productivity. despite notable advancements in deep learning techniques for disease identification, most experiments have been conducted under simplified laboratory conditions, posing challenges for accurately identifying crop diseases in complex real-world field environments. to bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the transformer model's ability to capture long-range global dependencies and handle occlusion. we propose a novel approach called dense cnns and transformer network (dctn) for accurate detection of field crop diseases. moreover, we introduce a new attention mechanism that utilizes multi-head self-attention via deep separable convolution projection and down-sampling, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. additionally, we have meticulously curated and cleaned a dataset of 45,547 images depicting healthy and diseased crops in real-field environments. our proposed method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in terms of its robustness against background interference in crop disease detection. notably, dctn achieves accuracies of 93.01% and 99.69% on our dataset and a publicly available dataset, respectively. for those who are interested, the code for our approach will be made available on https://github.com/wh9704/dctn.",AB_0309
"in the intelligent transportation system, traffic forecasting, which is generally characterized as a graph spatial-temporal prediction task, plays a crucial role. it is challenging to generate reliable forecast results due to the complexity of traffic topological information and the inherent uncertainty of road traffic circumstances. existing works generally focus on modeling spatial dependency on static graph structures, but ignore dynamic relations between road segments and cannot extract long-range traffic dependencies in spatial-temporal domains. to bridge the above gaps, we present a novel framework, called dynamic multi-hop graph attention network (dmgan). specifically, we leverage dynamic graph modeling to capture time-varying relations across road sections and introduce the multi-hop operation in each message propagation layer to extract long-range spatial dependency. meanwhile, we develop a fusion-attention module, preserving both local and global hidden layer outputs of the encoder, to capture both long- and short-term temporal dependencies jointly. in this way, our method can fully model complex time-varying traffic topology information and capture the internal patterns of traffic series by integrating dynamic graph structure and temporal attention component. dgman achieves state-of-the-art performance in three metrics, as demonstrated by experimental findings on four real-world public traffic datasets, metr-la, pems-bay, pems03, and pems07. this code and data are available at https://github.com/eehiter/2022-tkde-dmgan-pytorch/tree/main for reproducibility and further studies.",AB_0309
"in order to solve the problem that the traditional spectral clustering algorithm is time-consuming and resource consuming when applied to large-scale data, resulting in poor clustering effect or even unable to cluster, this paper proposes a spectral clustering algorithm based on granular-ball(gbsc). the algorithm changes the construction method of the similarity matrix. based on granular-ball, the size of the similarity matrix is greatly reduced, and the construction of the similarity matrix is more reasonable. experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better speedup ratio, less memory consumption and stronger anti noise performance while achieving similar clustering results to the traditional spectral clustering algorithm. suppose the number of granular-balls is m, n is the number of points in the dataset, and m << n, the time complexity of gbsc is o(m(3)). it is proved that gbsc has good adaptability to large-scale datasets. all codes have been released at https://github.com/xjnine/gbsc.",AB_0309
"feature selection is an important preprocessing step in data mining and pattern recognition. the neighborhood rough set (nrs) model is a widely-used rough set model for feature selection on continuous data. all currently known nrs models are defined on a distance metric - mostly the euclidean distance metric - which invalidates the nrs models in scenarios wherein the euclidean distance is ineffective, for example, while considering differing attribute weights. we first introduce the concept of space division of granular-rectangular, and then construct the neighborhood radius in our method by describing the relationship between child and parent spaces, which avoids the use of a distance metric and reduces the search space for the neighborhood radius. this greatly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of nrs. in addition, the upper and lower approximations of the granular-rectangular rough sets (grrss) comprise equivalence classes; this results in better performance of grrs in knowledge representation compared with the traditional nrs. experimental results on public benchmark datasets reveal that our method, grrs, achieves higher accuracy than ten popular and state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, including two nrs algorithms. moreover, grrs outperforms the established nrs algorithms regarding efficiency, including the state-of-the-art nrs algorithm, gbnrs. all code has been released as an open libary called grrs: https://github.com/syxiaa/grrs.",AB_0309
"the aim of sequential pattern mining (spm) is to discover potentially useful information from a given sequence. although various spm methods have been investigated, most of these focus on mining all of the patterns. however, users sometimes want to mine patterns with the same specific prefix pattern, called co-occurrence pattern. since sequential rule mining can make better use of the results of spm, and obtain better recommendation performance, this paper addresses the issue of maximal co-occurrence nonoverlapping sequential rule (mcor) mining and proposes the mcor-miner algorithm. to improve the efficiency of support calculation, mcor-miner employs depth-first search and backtracking strategies equipped with an indexing mechanism to avoid the use of sequential searching. to obviate useless support calculations for some sequences, mcor-miner adopts a filtering strategy to prune the sequences without the prefix pattern. to reduce the number of candidate patterns, mcor-miner applies the frequent item and binomial enumeration tree strategies. to avoid searching for the maximal rules through brute force, mcor-miner uses a screening strategy. to validate the performance of mcor-miner, eleven competitive algorithms were conducted on eight sequences. our experimental results showed that mcor-miner outperformed other competitive algorithms, and yielded better recommendation performance than frequent co-occurrence pattern mining. all algorithms and datasets can be downloaded from https://github.com/wuc567/pattern-mining/tree/master/mcor-miner.",AB_0309
"cross-modal hash has become a key technology for large datasets retrieval. however, some challenges still need to be tackled: 1) how to effectively embed semantic information into hash learning; 2) how to strengthen cross-modal mutual communication and common learning; 3) how to effectively solve data extension with semantics. in this paper, we propose a novel extensible multi-similarity cross-modal hash learning (emchl) method. to reduce the differentiation of inter-modal and strengthen cross-modal mutual communication, emchl mainly considers three similarity measures: 1) using hamming distance to measure the semantic structure self-similarity of label and sample hash codes in unimodal, it can reduce the sample quantization error; 2) the log-likelihood function is adopted to enhance information exchange in cross-modal hash codes. correspondence cross-modal reciprocal-similarity measurement can reduce the inter-modal quantization code errors; 3) the robust low-rank constraint of the dot product is introduced to perform the cross-modal sparse latent-similarity calculation. it can establish the connection between the common latent semantic space and the hash codes. besides, we also propose an interactive projection matrix learning (ipml) extensible mechanism that makes it easier to be applied to large-scale retrieval datasets. extensive experiment results show the superior performance of emchl compared to state-of-the-art cross-modal hash methods. our method code is released at: https://github .com /tjeep -tan /emchl.",AB_0309
"dos (delta open set) is an interesting clustering algorithm that transforms cluster identification into set identification. it identifies the objects whose neighborhoods coincide as an open-set, and an open-set corresponds to a cluster. however, once the dataset is complex, dos tends to identify overlapping clusters as one category. we believe the main reason is that dos unifies the neighborhood radius by a specific function, resulting in the inability to cope with various object distributions. to improve dos, we propose dos-in (irregular neighborhoods). specifically, dos in generates irregular neighborhoods based on the similarity between objects to self-adapt to diverse object distributions. as a result, dos-in not only can accurately distinguish overlapping clusters but also has fewer input parameters. in addition, dos-in introduces the small-cluster merging mechanism to address the shortcoming of dos in recognizing gaussian clusters. the experimental results show that dos-in is completely superior to dos. compared with baseline methods, dos-in outperforms them on 7 out of 10 datasets, with at least 13.8% (nmi) and 2.4% (ri) improvement in accuracy. the code of dos-in is available at https://github .com /youth-49 / 2023-dos-in.",AB_0309
"reconstructing functional gene regulatory networks (grns) is a primary prerequisite for understanding pathogenic mechanisms and curing diseases in animals, and it also provides an important foundation for cultivating vegetable and fruit varieties that are resistant to diseases and corrosion in plants. many computational methods have been developed to infer grns, but most of the regulatory relationships between genes obtained by these methods are biased. eliminating indirect effects in grns remains a significant challenge for researchers. in this work, we propose a novel approach for inferring functional grns, named eiepcf (eliminating indirect effects produced by confounding factors), which eliminates indirect effects caused by confounding factors. this method eliminates the influence of confounding factors on regulatory factors and target genes by measuring the similarity between their residuals. the validation results of the eiepcf method on simulation studies, the gold-standard networks provided by the dream3 challenge and the real gene networks of escherichia coli demonstrate that it achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to other popular computational methods for inferring grns. as a case study, we utilized the eiepcf method to reconstruct the cold-resistant specific grn from gene expression data of cold-resistant in arabidopsis thaliana. the source code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanglab-wbgcas/eiepcf.",AB_0309
"colocalization analysis of genomic region sets has been widely adopted to unveil potential functional interactions between corresponding biological attributes, which often serves as the basis for further investigation. a number of methods have been developed for colocalization analysis of genomic elements. however, none of them explicitly considered the transcriptome heterogeneity and isoform ambiguity, making them less appropriate for analyzing transcriptome elements. here, we developed rgntx, an r/bioconductor tool for the colocalization analysis of transcriptome elements with permutation tests. different from existing approaches, rgntx directly takes advantage of transcriptome annotation, and offers high flexibility in the null model to simulate realistic transcriptome-wide background, such as the complex alternative splicing patterns. importantly, it supports the testing of transcriptome elements without clear isoform association, which is often the real scenario due to technical limitations. proposed package offers a wide selection of pre-defined functions, easy to be utilized by users for visualizing permutation results, calculating shifted z-scores and conducting multiple hypothesis testing under benjamini-hochberg correction. moreover, with synthetic and real datasets, we show that rgntx novel testing modes return distinct and more significant results compared to existing genome-based methods. we believe rgntx should make a useful tool to characterize the randomness of the transcriptome, and for conducting statistical association analysis for genomic region sets within the heterogeneous transcriptome. the package now has been accepted by bioconductor and is freely available at: https://bioconductor.org/packages/rgntx.",AB_0309
"convolutional neural networks (cnns) and visual transformers (vits) are both known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. recent work has illustrated the existence of transferability between the two, but the experimental performance is generally mediocre. to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples between cnns and vits, we propose a novel attack on the phenomenon that cnns and vits differ significantly in their inductive bias, which not only attacks the same inductive bias between the two classes of models, but also suppresses the unique of vits. we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on stateof -the -art vits, cnns, and robustly trained cnns, and demonstrate significant improvements in transferability, both between vits and from vits to cnns. the code for our project is available at https://github .com /chenxiaoyupetter /inductive -biase -attack.",AB_0309
