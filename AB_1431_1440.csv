"the completion of point cloud directly affects the accuracy of primitive parameter extraction and 3d reconstruction. due to the limitations of sensor scanning, point cloud are often incomplete due to occlusions during the data collection. to solve the problem of incomplete building point clouds and to support geometric detail lod2 reconstruction, a point cloud completion method with structural constraint is proposed in this paper. first, based on the idea of cloth simulation, regularity and planarity of the building were used to impose structural constraints on the cloth nodes. combined with the rigidity of the building, the force rules of nodes under the distribution of the building structure are formulated. then, the sinking and rebounding stages of the node were simulated to recover the position of point cloud in the area of interest. finally, the missing surface in each facade direction was completed by attitude adjustment. the solution of a multi-layer structural facade was realized by the selection of parameters during the sinking and rebounding stage. the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed point cloud completion method have been verified through experiments. it is demonstrated that the proposed method can improve the integrity of a building point cloud by achieving more than 90% coverage. compared with existing methods, the proposed method can deal with the problem of large-scale structure missing from buildings with fewer limitations. the patched points do not rely on the geometric primitives' extraction and are based on the distribution of existing points without redundant observations, so the patched points adapt better to the existing building points. the proposed method has enhanced the utilization of point clouds and improved the detail of lod2 reconstruction. it provides a new feasible method for point cloud completion. the code of the method is available at https://github.com/bufanzhao/point-cloud-completion.git.",AB_0144
"although human activity recognition (har) based on wifi channel state information (csi) has been widely studied, as the csi signal is susceptible to the external environment, a recognition framework with high accuracy and low complexity remains a key and difficult problem. to improve wifi sensing performance and reduce model complexity, imgfi, a gesture recognition system, is proposed, which includes a conversion module and a recognition module. the conversion module is used to convert the csi to images, and the key difference of the proposed imgfi is using signal variations in arbitrarily different timestamps as feature extraction units rather than single signal points. this conversion can also take advantage of the powerful ability of the convolutional neural network (cnn) in the field of image recognition. five csi imaging approaches are introduced in imgfi to realize the csi conversion while a cnn is designed to recognize the activity from the converted images. to verify the proposed framework, we make some tests in our laboratory and get a dataset. the tests on four datasets under different contexts indicate that imgfi with only three convolutional layers achieves 99.5% recognition accuracy. that is, our method has higher accuracy and lower complexity, which is important to related applications, such as smart homes and virtual reality. we will publish our code at https://github.com/shengjunzi/imgfi.",AB_0144
"lung adenocarcinoma (luad) is a common subtype of primary lung cancer. fatty acid oxidation plays a key role in luad development by providing energy for tumor cells. this study aimed to identify the role of ring finger protein 152 (rnf152) in luad. rnf152 was down-regulated in luad, and low rnf152 expression correlated with a poor prognosis in luad patients. rnf152 overexpression inhibited the proliferation and malignant phenotype of luad cells, whereas rnf152 knockdown exerted an opposite effect. tumor cells overexpressing rnf152 showed less fatty acid oxidation compared with control cells, whereas rnf152 knockdown induced fatty acid uptake and oxidation. further analysis revealed the binding reaction between rnf152 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (irak1). rnf152 reduced the stability of irak1 in luad cells by promoting its ubiquitination. rnf152-overexpressed tumor cells exhibited a significantly lower level of aldo-keto reductase family 1 member 10 (akr1b10), whereas up-regulation of irak1 restored the expression of akr1b10 in rnf152-overexpressed cells. furthermore, up-regulation of irak1 eliminated the antitumor effect of rnf152 in luad cells. mouse xenograft models confirmed the inhibitory effect of rnf152 on the tumorigenesis and metastasis of luad. taken together, rnf152 played a tumor suppressive role in luad by promoting irak1 ubiquitination and irak1-mediated down-regulation of akr1b10, thereby reversing the malignant phenotype of luad.

"single-image 3d urban building reconstruction is an important and challenging topic in computer vision. however, it is a highly ill-posed problem due to the intrinsic geometrical ambiguity in a 3d space. to address the problem, this paper presents a novel single-image piecewise planar reconstruction method based on geometric priors. the proposed method utilizes geometric priors (e.g., plane orientation and intersection angles between planes) learned through convolutional neural networks to handle three challenging subtasks sequentially: (1) detecting planar regions with structure information (e.g., each component edge is associated with two planes intersecting at a specified angle); (2) inferring the planes corresponding to the planar regions progressively by taking full advantage of diverse constraints (e.g., structure and proximity constraints) based on geometric priors; and (3) globally optimizing the resulting planes under a unified framework that incorporates image cues and geometric priors. experimental results on two public datasets released by casia and our own dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art methods (including two geometrybased methods and three learning-based methods) by an approximately 20 % margin in terms of accuracy. code and data are available at https://github.com/three-dimensional-computer-vision/single-image-reconstruction.",AB_0144
"reliance on vast annotations to achieve leading performance severely restricts the practicality of large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. for the purpose of reducing data annotation costs, effective labeling schemes are developed and contribute to attaining competitive results under weak supervision strategy. revisiting current weak label forms, we introduce one class one click (ococ), a low cost yet informative quasi scene-level label, which encapsulates both point-level and scene-level annotations. an active weakly supervised framework is proposed to leverage scarce labels by involving weak supervision from both global and local perspectives. contextual constraints are imposed by an auxiliary scene classification task, respectively based on global feature embedding and point-wise prediction aggregation, which restricts the model prediction merely to ococ labels within a sub-cloud. furthermore, we design a context-aware pseudo labeling strategy, which effectively supplement point-level supervisory signals subject to ococ labels. finally, an active learning scheme with a uncertainty measure - temporal output discrepancy is integrated to examine informative samples and provides guidance on sub-clouds query, which is conducive to quickly attaining desirable ococ annotations and reduces the labeling cost to an extremely low extent. extensive experimental analysis using three lidar benchmarks respectively collected from airborne, mobile and ground platforms demonstrates that our proposed method achieves very promising results though subject to scarce labels. it considerably outperforms genuine scene-level weakly supervised methods by up to 25% in terms of average f1 score and achieves competitive results against full supervision schemes. on terrestrial lidar dataset - semantics3d, using approximately 2 parts per thousand of labels, our method achieves an average f1 score of 85.2%, which increases by 11.58% compared to the baseline model. codes are publicly available at https://github.com/puzow/one-class-one-click.",AB_0144
"multimodal image matching is a core basis for information fusion, change detection, and image-based navigation. however, multimodal images may simultaneously suffer from severe nonlinear radiation distortion (nrd) and complex geometric differences, which pose great challenges to existing methods. although deep learning-based methods had shown potential in image matching, they mainly focus on same-source images or single types of multimodal images such as optical-synthetic aperture radar (sar). one of the main obstacles is the lack of public data for different types of multimodal images. in this paper, we make two major contributions to the community of multimodal image matching: first, we collect six typical types of images, including optical-optical, optical-infrared, optical-sar, optical-depth, optical-map, and nighttime, to construct a multimodal image dataset with a total of 1200 pairs. this dataset has good diversity in image categories, feature classes, resolutions, geometric variations, etc. second, we propose a scale and rotation invariant feature transform (srif) method, which achieves good matching performance without relying on data characteristics. this is one of the advantages of our srif over deep learning methods. srif obtains the scales of fast keypoints by projecting them into a simple pyramid scale space, which is based on the study that methods with/without scale space have similar performance under small scale change factors. this strategy largely reduces the complexity compared to traditional gaussian scale space. srif also proposes a local intensity binary transform (libt) for sift-like feature description, which can largely enhance the structure information inside multimodal images. extensive experiments on these 1200 image pairs show that our srif outperforms current state-of-the-arts by a large margin, including rift, cofsm, lnift, and ms-hlmo. both the created dataset and the code of srif will be publicly available in https://github.com/ljy-rs/srif.",AB_0144
"the identification of microbial characteristics associated with diseases is crucial for disease diagnosis and therapy. however, the presence of heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and large amounts of microbial data presents tremendous challenges in discovering key microbial features. in this paper, we present idam, a novel computational method for inferring disease-associated gene modules from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. this method integrates gene context conservation (uber-operons) and regulatory mechanisms (gene coexpression patterns) within a mathematical graph model to explore gene modules associated with specific diseases. it alleviates reliance on prior meta-data. we applied idam to publicly available datasets from inflammatory bowel disease, melanoma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and irritable bowel syndrome. the results demonstrated the superior performance of idam in inferring disease-associated characteristics compared to existing popular tools. furthermore, we showcased the high reproducibility of the gene modules inferred by idam using independent cohorts with inflammatory bowel disease. we believe that idam can be a highly advantageous method for exploring disease-associated microbial characteristics. the source code of idam is freely available at https://github.com/osu-bmbl/idam, and the web server can be accessed at https://bmblx.bmi. osumc.edu/idam/.",AB_0144
