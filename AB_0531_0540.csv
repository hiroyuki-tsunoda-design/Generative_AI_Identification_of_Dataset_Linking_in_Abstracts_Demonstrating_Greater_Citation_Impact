"the identification of unknown chemicals has emerged as a significant issue in untargeted metabolome analysis owing to the limited availability of purified standards for identification; this is a major bottleneck for the accumulation of reusable metabolome data in systems biology. public resources for discovering and prioritizing the unknowns that should be subject to practical identification, as well as further detailed study of spending costs and the risks of misprediction, are lacking. as such a resource, we released databases, food-, plant- and thing-metabolome repository (http://metabolites.in/foods,http://metabolites.in/plants,andhttp://metabolites.in/things, referred to as xmrs) in which the sample-specific localization of unknowns detected by liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry in a wide vari-ety of samples can be examined, helping to discoverand prioritize the unknowns. a set of application pro-gramming interfaces for the xmrs facilitates the useof metabolome data for large-scale analysis and datamining. several applications of xmrs, including in-tegrated metabolome and genome analyses, are pre-sented. expanding the concept of xmrs will acceler-ate the identification of unknowns and increase thediscovery of new knowledge.",AB_0054

"road accidents are often caused by short abnormal events, including traffic violations, abrupt change in vehicular motion, driver fatigue, etc. observing an accident event from the right camera perspective plays a crucial role while detecting accidents. however, it may not be possible to capture such abnormal events from a limited camera perspective. we present a deep learning framework to analyze the accident events recorded from multiple perspectives. first, we estimate feature similarity in videos recorded from multiple perspectives. we then divided the video samples into high and low feature similarity groups. next, we extract spatio-temporal features from each group using two-branch dcnns and fuse them using a rank-based weighted average pooling strategy followed by classification. we present a new road accident video dataset (mp-rad), where each accident event is synthetically generated and captured from five independent camera perspectives using a computer gaming platform. most of the existing road accident datasets use egocentric views or they are captured in fixed camera setups. however, our dataset is large and multi-perspective that can be used to validate its-related tasks such as accident detection, accident localization, traffic monitoring, etc. the dataset contains 400 accident events with a total of 2000 videos. we provide temporal annotations of all videos. the proposed framework and the dataset have been cross-validated with latest accident detection baselines trained on real-world road accident videos and vice-versa. the sub-optimal detection accuracy obtained using the baselines indicates that the proposed framework and the dataset can be useful for its related research. code and dataset is available at: https://github.com/draxler1/mp-rad-dataset-its-",AB_0054
"the mobidb database (url: https://mobidb.org/)) is a knowledge base of intrinsically disordered proteins. mobidb aggregates disorder annotations derived from the literature and from experimental evidence along with predictions for all known protein sequences. mobidb generates new knowledge and captures the functional significance of disordered regions by processing and combining complementary sources of information. since its first release 10 years ago, the mobidb database has evolved in order to improve the quality and coverage of protein disorder annotations and its accessibility. mobidb has now reached its maturity in terms of data standardization and visualization. here, we present a new release which focuses on the optimization of user experience and database content. the major advances compared to the previous version are the integration of alphafolddb predictions and the re-implementation of the homology transfer pipeline, which expands manually curated annotations by two orders of magnitude. finally, the entry page has been restyled in order to provide an overview of the available annotations along with two separate views that highlight structural disorder evidence and functions associated with different binding modes.",AB_0054
"this paper introduces a novel bio-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, named termite life cycle optimizer (tlco), which is based on both the life cycle of a termite colony and the modulation of movement strategies used by many animal species in nature. termite colonies are comprised of three distinct castes: the workers, the soldiers and the reproductive termites. each caste undertakes a set of specific tasks that ensure the growth and survival of the colony. tlco mimics the activities of these three castes that are implemented in a mathematical model. the model is then used to find the global optimum in classic optimization problems. first, the behaviors of the workers, soldiers and reproductive termites are used to simulate a balance between the tasks of exploration and exploitation. second, the initial population securely records the information obtained at each iteration and transmits it to workers and soldiers at the next iteration. this process is repeated until the global optimum is found with the smallest error. besides, a new proposed function combined with le ' vy flight is used to modulate the movement of termites that increases its flexibility. thus, tlco can cover both long distances during the first iterations to improve the convergence rate and shorter distances during the last iterations to enhance the level of accuracy. we then compare the performances of tlco with other well-known nature-inspired algorithms using 23 classical benchmark functions, cec2005 benchmark functions, and five real engineering design prob-lems. the results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of tlco in solving these optimization problems. source codes of tlco is publicly available at http://goldensolutionrs.com/termite-life-cycle-optimizer.html.",AB_0054

"a major challenge in single-cell biology is identifying cell-type-specific gene functions, which may substantially improve precision medicine. differential expression analysis of genes is a popular, yet insufficient approach, and complementary methods that associate function with cell type are required. here, we describe schumannet (https:// github.com/netbiolab/ schumannet), a single-cell network analysis platform for resolving cellular heterogeneity across gene functions in humans. based on cell-type-specific gene networks (cgns) constructed under the guidance of the humannet reference interactome, schumannet displayed higher functional relevance to the cellular context than cgns built by other methods on single-cell transcriptome data. cellular deconvolution of gene signatures based on network compactness across cell types revealed breast cancer prognostic markers associated with t cells. schumannet could also prioritize genes associated with particular cell types using cgn centrality and identified the differential hubness of cgns between disease and healthy conditions. we demonstrated the usefulness of schumannet by uncovering t-cell-specific functional effects of gitr, a prognostic gene for breast cancer, and functional defects in autism spectrum disorder genes specific for inhibitory neurons. these results suggest that schumannet will advance our understanding of cell-type specificity across human disease genes.",AB_0054

"gene coexpression is synchronization of gene expression across many cellular and environmental conditions and is widely used to infer the biological function of genes. gene coexpression information is complex, comprising a complete graph of all genes in the genome, and requires appropriate visualization and analysis tools. since its initial release in 2007, the animal gene expression database coxpresdb (https:// coxpresdb.jp) has been continuously improved by adding new gene coexpression data and analysis tools. here, we report coxpresdb version 8, which has been enhanced with new features for an overview, summary, and individual examination of coexpression relationships: coexmap to display coexpression on a genome scale, pathway enrichment analysis to summarize the function of coexpressed genes, and coexpub to bridges coexpression and existing knowledge. coxpresdb also facilitates downstream analyses such as interspecies comparisons by integrating rnaseq and microarray coexpression data in a union-type gene coexpression. coxpresdb strongly support users with the new coexpression data and enhanced functionality.",AB_0054
"the number of traffic accidents has been continuously increasing in recent years worldwide. many accidents are caused by distracted drivers, who take their attention away from driving. motivated by the success of convolutional neural networks (cnns) in computer vision, many researchers developed cnn-based algorithms to recognize distracted driving from a dashcam and warn the driver against unsafe behaviors. however, current models have too many parameters, which is unfeasible for vehicle-mounted computing. this work proposes a novel knowledge-distillation-based framework to solve this problem. the proposed framework first constructs a high-performance teacher network by progressively strengthening the robustness to illumination changes from shallow to deep layers of a cnn. then, the teacher network is used to guide the architecture searching process of a student network through knowledge distillation. after that, we use the teacher network again to transfer knowledge to the student network by knowledge distillation. experimental results on the statefarm distracted driver detection dataset and auc distracted driver dataset show that the proposed approach is highly effective for recognizing distracted driving behaviors from photos: (1) the teacher network's accuracy surpasses the previous best accuracy; (2) the student network achieves very high accuracy with only 0.42m parameters (around 55% of the previous most lightweight model). furthermore, the student network architecture can be extended to a spatial-temporal 3d cnn for recognizing distracted driving from video clips. the 3d student network largely surpasses the previous best accuracy with only 2.03m parameters on the drive&act dataset. the source code is available at https://github.com/dichao-liu/ lightweight_distracted_driver_recognition_with_distillation-based_nas_and_knowledge_transfer",AB_0054
