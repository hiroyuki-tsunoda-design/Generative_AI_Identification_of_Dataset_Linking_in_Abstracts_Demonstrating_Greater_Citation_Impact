"intrinsic disorder in proteins, a widely distributed phenomenon in nature, is related to many crucial biological processes and various diseases. traditional determination methods tend to be costly and labor-intensive, therefore it is desirable to seek an accurate identification method of intrinsically disordered proteins (idps). in this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning model for intrinsically disordered regions in proteins named deepdrp. deepdrp employed an innovative timedistributed strategy and bi-lstm architecture to predict idps and is driven by integrated view features of pssm, energy-based encoding, aaindex, and transformer-enhanced embeddings including dr-bert, ontoprotein, prot-t5, and esm-2. the comparison of different feature combinations indicates that the transformer-enhanced features contribute far more than traditional features to predict idps and esm-2 accounts for a larger contribution in the pre-trained fusion vectors. the ablation test verified that the timedistributed strategy surely increased the model performance and is an efficient approach to the idp prediction. compared with eight state-of-the-art methods on the disorder723, s1, and disprot832 datasets, the matthews correlation coefficient of deepdrp significantly outperformed competing methods by 4.90 % to 36.20 %, 11.80 % to 26.33 %, and 4.82 % to 13.55 %. in brief, deepdrp is a reliable model for idp prediction and is freely available at https://github.com/zx-cola/deepdrp.",AB_0138
"body condition has always been an important indicator reflecting the health status of livestock, and new automated and contactless methods for assessing it have also been continuously proposed. in recent years, with the continuous expansion of research on quantitative analysis of three-dimensional shapes in the field of agriculture, amount of studies has shown that quantitative analysis of shapes can promote the development of smart agriculture. this article proposed a method for quantitatively analyzing the local three-dimensional shape of livestock to evaluate their body conditions. this is a universal method that can be applied to various species. it uses the method of point-to-point correspondence in the three-dimensional shape to finely calculate the difference between shapes, and then maps the difference value to the range of the body condition score. the article analyzed the shape of 198 dairy cows, 100 beef cattle, and 201 pigs using body condition scores as test parameters. the accuracy of body condition evaluation within the range of error of 0.5 for dairy cows, 1 for beef cattle, and 0.5 for pigs are 100%, 87.61%, and 92.09%, respectively. compared to previous methods for assessing body condition, the method proposed in this paper is more accurate and versatile. the dataset used in this study, along with the code implementation have been made publicly available in https://gitee.com/kznd/lshape-analyser/tree/master/matlab.",AB_0138
"backgroundpostoperative pulmonary complications (ppcs) significantly increase the morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with lung cancer. considering the adverse effects of ppcs, we aimed to derive and validate a nomogram to predict pulmonary complications after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in elderly patients with lung cancer and to assist surgeons in optimizing patient-centered treatment plans.methodsthe study enrolled 854 eligible elderly patients with lung cancer who underwent sub-lobectomy or lobectomy. a clinical prediction model for the probability of ppcs was developed using univariate and multivariate analyses. furthermore, data from one center were used to derive the model, and data from another were used for external validation. the model's discriminatory capability, predictive accuracy, and clinical usefulness were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis, respectively.resultsamong the eligible elderly patients with lung cancer, 214 (25.06%) developed pulmonary complications after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, surgical procedure, operative time, forced expiratory volume in one second, and the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung were independent predictors of ppcs and were included in the final model. the areas under the roc curves (auc) of the training and validation sets were 0.844 and 0.796, respectively. ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the generalizability of the predictive model, with an average auc value of 0.839. the calibration curve showed good consistency between the observed and predicted probabilities. the proposed nomogram showed good net benefit with a relatively wide range of threshold probabilities.conclusiona nomogram for elderly patients with lung cancer can be derived using preoperative and intraoperative variables. our model can also be accessed using the online web server https://pulmonary-disease-predictor.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/. combining both may help surgeons as a clinically easy-to-use tool for minimizing the prevalence of pulmonary complications after lung resection in elderly patients.",AB_0138
"food is increasingly acknowledged as a powerful means to promote and maintain mental health. the introduction of the gut-brain axis has been instrumental in understanding the impact of food on mental health. it is widely reported that food can significantly influence gut microbiota metabolism, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining mental health. however, the vast amount of heterogeneous data published in recent research lacks systematic integration and application development. to remedy this, we construct a comprehensive knowledge graph, named food4healthkg, focusing on food, gut microbiota, and mental diseases. the constructed workflow includes the integration of numerous heterogeneous data, entity linking to a normalized format, and the well-designed representation of the acquired knowledge. to illustrate the availability of food4healthkg, we design two case studies: the knowledge query and the food recommendation based on food4healthkg. furthermore, we propose two evaluation methods to validate the quality of the results obtained from food4healthkg. the results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in practical applications, particularly in providing convincing food recommendations based on gut microbiota and mental health. food4healthkg is accessible at https://github.com/ccszbd/food4healthkg.",AB_0138
"navigating safely and efficiently in dense crowds remains a challenging problem for mobile robots. the interaction mechanisms involved in collision avoidance require robots to exhibit active and foresighted behaviors while understanding the crowd dynamics. deep reinforcement learning methods have shown superior performance compared to model-based approaches. however, existing methods lack an intuitive and quantitative safety evaluation for agents, and they may potentially trap agents in local optima during training, hindering their ability to learn optimal strategies. in addition, sparse reward problems further compound these limitations. to address these challenges, we propose safecrowdnav, a comprehensive crowd navigation algorithm that emphasizes obstacle avoidance in complex environments. our approach incorporates a safety evaluation function to quantitatively assess the current safety score and an intrinsic exploration reward to balance exploration and exploitation based on scene constraints. by combining prioritized experience replay and hindsight experience replay techniques, our model effectively learns the optimal navigation policy in crowded environments. experimental outcomes reveal that our approach enables robots to improve crowd comprehension during navigation, resulting in reduced collision probabilities and shorter navigation times compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. our code is available at https://github.com/janet-xujing-1216/safecrowdnav.",AB_0138
"target identification and bioactivity prediction are critical steps in the drug discovery process. here we introduce codd-pred (comprehensive drug design predictor), an online web server with well-curated data sets from the gostar database, which is designed with a dual purpose of predicting potential protein drug targets and computing bioactivity values of small molecules. we first designed a double molecular graph perception (dmgp) framework for target prediction based on a large library of 646 498 small molecules interacting with 640 human targets. the framework achieved a top-5 accuracy of over 80% for hitting at least one target on both external validation sets. additionally, its performance on the external validation set comprising 200 molecules surpassed that of four existing target prediction servers. second, we collected 56 targets closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer, metabolic diseases, and inflammatory immune diseases and developed a multi-model self-validation activity prediction (msap) framework that enables accurate bioactivity quantification predictions for small-molecule ligands of these 56 targets. codd-pred is a handy tool for rapid evaluation and optimization of small molecules with specific target activity. codd-pred is freely accessible at http://codd.iddd.group/.",AB_0138
"predicting relationships between biological entities can greatly benefit important biomedical problems. previous studies have attempted to represent biological entities and relationships in euclidean space using embedding methods, which evaluate their semantic similarity by representing entities as numerical vectors. however, the limitation of these methods is that they cannot prevent the loss of latent hierarchical information when embedding large graph-structured data into euclidean space, and therefore cannot capture the semantics of entities and relationships accurately. hyperbolic spaces, such as poincare ball, are better suited for hierarchical modeling than euclidean spaces. this is because hyperbolic spaces exhibit negative curvature, causing distances to grow exponentially as they approach the boundary. in this paper, we propose hem, a hyperbolic hierarchical knowledge graph embedding model to generate vector representations of bio-entities. by encoding the entities and relations in the hyperbolic space, hem can capture latent hierarchical information and improve the accuracy of biological entity representation. notably, hem can preserve rich information with a low dimension compared with the methods that encode entities in euclidean space. furthermore, we explore the performance of hem in protein-protein interaction prediction and gene-disease association prediction tasks. experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of he m over state-of-the-art baselines. the data and code are available at : https://github.com/nan-ll/hem.",AB_0138
"a few well-annotated datasets for land-cover semantic segmentation have recently been introduced to advance the field of earth observation technologies. however, these datasets overlook the significant diversity among geographic areas with different climates, which can greatly impact and diversify land cover. consequently, this leads to a domain gap in remote sensing images and severe performance degradation of the segmentation models. to enhance land-cover semantic segmentation with improved generalization ability, we conducted the first investigation into the impact of climate on this task. in this paper, we present a unique largescale climate-aware satellite images dataset (casid) specifically designed for domain adaptive land-cover semantic segmentation. it consists of 980 satellite images with a size of 5000 x 5000 pixels, collected from 30 different regions around asia, covering over 24,500 square kilometers. these images are gathered from four distinct climate zones, namely temperate monsoon, subtropical monsoon, tropical monsoon, and tropical rainforest. it includes four sub-datasets/domains, each representing one of the aforementioned climate zones. this characteristic makes casid the first climate-aware land-cover semantic segmentation dataset with multiple domains. additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the samples from the four climate zones, emphasizing differences in global image features, image texture, category distribution, spectral value, and object shape. these analyses offer valuable insights for subsequent research in this field. moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the latest semantic segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation methods on the casid dataset. these results serve as a robust baseline for future research endeavors. our dataset will be made publicly available soon at the following link: https://github.com/linwei-chen/casid.",AB_0138

"generative adversarial networks (gans) has long dominated the field of image reconstruction and editing. it is capable to train a generator in an adversarial way, which can fool the discriminator and enable the generated image to be of high quality. however, this approach is often difficult to train, and the final result is hard to converge. each different style of image requires construction of different datasets and complex optimization functions, and the training process is uncertain. to solve this problem, we propose a realistic image reconstruction and editing method based on stochastic differential equation (sde-rae), where the diffusion model converts gaussian noise to real photos by iterative denoising. what we only need to do is to construct simple loss functions in the reconstruction process to achieve high-quality image reconstruction, and we propose a novel semantic enhancement clip (contrastive language-image pre-training) to interfere with the sde parameter optimization direction in the editing process. simple text is needed to achieve unique image editing. our method generates high-quality images that retain the texture and contour features of the original image. specifically, we manipulate the initial image, perturb the image by adding random noise, and then iteratively denoise the image by reverse sde, manipulating the image's rgb pixels to achieve image reconstruction and editing. code and dataset https://github.com/haizhu12/sde-rae.",AB_0138
