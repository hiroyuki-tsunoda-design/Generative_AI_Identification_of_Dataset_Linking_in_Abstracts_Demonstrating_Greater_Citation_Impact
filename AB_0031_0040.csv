"federated distillation (fd) is a popular novel algorithmic paradigm for federated learning (fl), which achieves training performance competitive to prior parameter averaging-based methods, while additionally allowing the clients to train different model architectures, by distilling the client predictions on an unlabeled auxiliary set of data into a student model. in this work, we propose fedaux, an extension to fd, which, under the same set of assumptions, drastically improves the performance by deriving maximum utility from the unlabeled auxiliary data. fedaux modifies the fd training procedure in two ways: first, unsupervised pre-training on the auxiliary data is performed to find a suitable model initialization for the distributed training. second, epsilon, delta)-differentially private certainty scoring is used to weight the ensemble predictions on the auxiliary data according to the certainty of each client model. experiments on large-scale convolutional neural networks (cnns) and transformer models demonstrate that our proposed method achieves remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art fl methods, without adding appreciable computation, communication, or privacy cost. for instance, when training resnet8 on non-independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsets of cifar10, fedaux raises the maximum achieved validation accuracy from 30.4% to 78.1%, further closing the gap to centralized training performance. code is available at https://github.com/fedl-repo/fedaux.",AB_0004
"recovering dense depth maps from sparse depth sensors, such as lidar, is a recently proposed task with many computer vision and robotics applications. previous works have identified input sparsity as the key challenge of this task. to solve the sparsity challenge, we propose a recurrent distance transform pooling (dtp) module that aggregates multi-level nearby information prior to the backbone neural network. the intuition of this module is originated from the observation that most pixels within the receptive field of the network are zero. this indicates a deep and heavy network structure has to be used to enlarge the receptive field aiming at capturing enough useful information as most processed signals are uninformative zeros. our recurrent dtp module can fill in empty pixels with the nearest value in a local patch and recurrently transform distance to reach farther nearest points. the output of the proposed dtp module is a collection of multi-level semi-dense depth maps from original sparse to almost full. processing this collection of semi-dense depth maps alleviates the network from the input sparsity, which helps a lightweight simplified resnet-18 with 1m parameters achieve state-of-the-art performance on the karlsruhe institute of technology and toyota technological institute (kitti) depth completion benchmark with lidar only. besides the sparsity, the input lidar map also contains some incorrect values due to the sensor error. thus, we further enhance the dtp with an error correction (ec) module to avoid the spreading of the incorrect input values. at last, we discuss the benefit of only using lidar for nighttime driving and the potential extension of the proposed method for sensor fusion and the indoor scenario. the code has been released online at https://github.com/placeforyiming/distancetransform-depthcompletion.",AB_0004
"predictive modeling is useful but very challenging in biological image analysis due to the high cost of obtaining and labeling training data. for example, in the study of gene interaction and regulation in drosophila embryogenesis, the analysis is most biologically meaningful when in situ hybridization (ish) gene expression pattern images from the same developmental stage are compared. however, labeling training data with precise stages is very time-consuming even for developmental biologists. thus, a critical challenge is how to build accurate computational models for precise developmental stage classification from limited training samples. in addition, identification and visualization of developmental landmarks are required to enable biologists to interpret prediction results and calibrate models. to address these challenges, we propose a deep two-step low-shot learning framework to accurately classify ish images using limited training images. specifically, to enable accurate model training on limited training samples, we formulate the task as a deep low-shot learning problem and develop a novel two-step learning approach, including data-level learning and feature-level learning. we use a deep residual network as our base model and achieve improved performance in the precise stage prediction task of ish images. furthermore, the deep model can be interpreted by computing saliency maps, which consists of pixel-wise contributions of an image to its prediction result. in our task, saliency maps are used to assist the identification and visualization of developmental landmarks. our experimental results show that the proposed model can not only make accurate predictions but also yield biologically meaningful interpretations. we anticipate our methods to be easily generalizable to other biological image classification tasks with small training datasets. our open-source code is available at https://github.com/divelab/lsl-fly.",AB_0004
"generative adversarial networks (gans) are one of the most powerful generative models, but always require a large and balanced dataset to train. traditional gans are not applicable to generate minority-class images in a highly imbalanced dataset. balancing gan (bagan) is proposed to mitigate this problem, but it is unstable when images in different classes look similar, e.g., flowers and cells. in this work, we propose a supervised autoencoder with an intermediate embedding model to disperse the labeled latent vectors. with the enhanced autoencoder initialization, we also build an architecture of bagan with gradient penalty (bagan-gp). our proposed model overcomes the unstable issue in original bagan and converges faster to high-quality generations. our model achieves high performance on the imbalanced scale-down version of mnist fashion, cifar-10, and one small-scale medical image dataset. https://github.com/gh920/improved-bagan-gp.",AB_0004
"video prediction is a challenging computer vision task that has a wide range of applications. in this work, we present a new family of transformer-based models for video prediction. firstly, an efficient local spatial- temporal separation attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the complexity of standard transformers. then, a full autoregressive model, a partial autoregressive model and a non-autoregressive model are developed based on the new efficient transformer. the partial autoregressive model has a similar performance with the full autoregressive model but a faster inference speed. the non-autoregressive model not only achieves a faster infer-ence speed but also mitigates the quality degradation problem of the autoregressive counterparts, but it requires additional parameters and loss function for learning. given the same attention mechanism, we conducted a com-prehensive study to compare the proposed three video prediction variants. experiments show that the proposed video prediction models are competitive with more complex state-of-the-art convolutional-lstm based models. the source code is available at https://github.com/xiye20/vptr.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0004
"crispr-cas, as a tool for gene editing, has received extensive attention in recent years. anti-crispr (acr) proteins can inactivate the crispr-cas defense system during interference phase, and can be used as a potential tool for the regulation of gene editing. in-depth study of anti-crispr proteins is of great significance for the implementation of gene editing. in this study, we developed a high-accuracy prediction model based on two-step model fusion strategy, called acrpred, which could produce an auc of 0.952 with independent dataset validation. to further validate the proposed model, we compared with published tools and correctly identified 9 of 10 new acr proteins, indicating the strong generalization ability of our model. finally, for the convenience of related wet-experimental researchers, a user-friendly web-server acrpred (anti-crispr proteins prediction) was established at http://lin-group.cn/server/acrpred, by which users can easily identify potential anti-crispr proteins.",AB_0004
"the isoelectric point (pi) is a fundamental physicochemical property of peptides and proteins. it is widely used to steer design away from low solubility and aggregation and guide peptide separation and purification. experimental measurements of pi can be replaced by calculations knowing the ionizable groups of peptides and their corresponding pka values. different pka sets are published in the literature for natural amino acids, however, they are insufficient to describe synthetically modified peptides, complex peptides of natural origin, and peptides conjugated with structures of other modalities. noncanonical modifications (ncaas) are ignored in the conventional sequence-based pi calculations, therefore producing large errors in their pi predictions. in this work, we describe a pi calculation method that uses the chemical structure as an input, automatically identifies ionizable groups of ncaas and other fragments, and performs pka predictions for them. the method is validated on a curated set of experimental measures on 29 modified and 119093 natural peptides, providing an improvement of r2 from 0.74 to 0.95 and 0.96 against the conventional sequence-based approach for modified peptides for the two studied pka prediction tools, acdlabs and pkamatcher, correspondingly. the method is available in the form of an open source python library at https://github.com/astrazeneca/peptidetools, which can be integrated into other proprietary and free software packages. we anticipate that the pi calculation tool may facilitate optimization and purification activities across various application domains of peptides, including the development of biopharmaceuticals.",AB_0004
"underlying medical conditions, such as cancer, kidney disease and heart failure, are associated with a higher risk for severe covid-19. accurate classification of covid-19 patients with underlying medical conditions is critical for personalized treatment decision and prognosis estimation. in this study, we propose an interpretable artificial intelligence model termed vdjminer to mine the underlying medical conditions and predict the prognosis of covid-19 patients according to their immune repertoires. in a cohort of more than 1400 covid-19 patients, vdjminer accurately identifies multiple underlying medical conditions, including cancers, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) of 0.961. meanwhile, in this same cohort, vdjminer achieves an auc of 0.922 in predicting severe covid-19. moreover, vdjminer achieves an accuracy of 0.857 in predicting the response of covid-19 patients to tocilizumab treatment on the leave -one -out test. additionally, vdjminer interpretively mines and scores v(d)j gene segments of the t-cell receptors that are associated with the disease. the identified associations between single -cell v(d)j gene segments and covid-19 are highly consistent with previous studies. the source code of vdjminer is publicly accessible at hops:// github.com/tencentailabhealthcarendjminer. the web server of vdjminer is available at https://gene.ai.tencent.comndjminert.",AB_0004
"motivation: single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (scatac-seq) is a valuable resource to learn cis regulatory elements such as cell -type specific enhancers and transcription factor binding sites. however, cell-type identification of scatac-seq data is known to be challenging due to the heterogeneity derived from different protocols and the high dropout rate. results: in this study, we perform a systematic comparison of seven scatac-seq datasets of mouse brain to benchmark the efficacy of neuronal cell -type annotation from gene sets. we find that redundant marker genes give a dramatic improvement for a sparse scatac-seq annotation across the data collected from different studies. interestingly, simple aggregation of such marker genes achieves performance comparable or higher than that of machine -learning classifiers, suggesting its potential for downstream applications. based on our results, we reannotated all scatac-seq data for detailed cell types using robust marker genes. their meta scatac-seq profiles are publicly available at https://gillisweb.cshledu/meta_scatac. furthermore, we trained a deep neural network to predict chromatin accessibility from only dna sequence and identified key motifs enriched for each neuronal subtype. those predicted profiles are visualized together in our database as a valuable resource to explore cell -type specific epigenetic regulation in a sequence dependent and -independent manner.",AB_0004
"motivation to provide high quality, computationally tractable annotation of binding sites for biologically relevant (cognate) ligands in uniprotkb using the chemical ontology chebi (chemical entities of biological interest), to better support efforts to study and predict functionally relevant interactions between protein sequences and structures and small molecule ligands. results: we structured the data model for cognate ligand binding site annotations in uniprotkb and performed a complete reannotation of all cognate ligand binding sites using stable unique identifiers from chebi, which we now use as the reference vocabulary for all such annotations. we developed improved search and query facilities for cognate ligands in the uniprot website, rest api and sparql endpoint that leverage the chemical structure data, nomenclature and classification that chebi provides. availability and implementation: binding site annotations for cognate ligands described using chebi are available for uniprotkb protein sequence records in several formats (text, xml and rdf) and are freely available to query and download through the uniprot website (www.uniprot.org), rest api (www.uniprot.org/help/api), sparql endpoint (sparql.uniprot.org/) and ftp site (https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/). contact: alan.bridge@sib.swiss supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.",AB_0004
