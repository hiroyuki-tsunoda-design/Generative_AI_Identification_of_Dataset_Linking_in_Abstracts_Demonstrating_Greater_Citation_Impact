"sweetness is a vital taste to which humans are innately attracted. given the increasing prevalence of type-2 diabetes, it is highly relevant to build computational models to predict the sweetness of small molecules. such models are valuable for identifying sweeteners with low calorific value. we present regression-based machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting sweetness. toward this goal, we manually curated the most extensive dataset of 671 sweet molecules with known experimental sweetness values ranging from 0.2 to 22,500,000. gradient boost and random forest regressors emerged as the best models for predicting the sweetness of molecules with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and 0.92, respectively. our models show state-of -the-art performance when compared with previously published studies. besides making our dataset (sweet-preddb) available, we also present a user-friendly web server to return the predicted sweetness for small mol-ecules, sweetpred (https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/sweetpred).",AB_0063
"the high incidence of diseases caused by multi-drug resistant (mdr) pathogens combined with the shortage of effective antibiotics has necessitated the development of in-silico machine and deep learning tools to facilitate rapid drug discovery. the construction of computational models to discover antibacterial peptides (abps) in proteins of various organisms to develop a new line of antibiotics has emerged as a possible recourse. to this end, we used multi-scale temporal convolutional networks (mstcn) to develop a robust deep learning-based model called mstcn-abppred (bl) that classifies abps with an accuracy of 98% (which is better than various state-of-the-art models). the main contribution of this proposed work is that we have incorporated a continual learning module in this model so that it keeps adapting itself dynamically by re-training on new data points. this re-trainable version of the baseline model (mstcn-abppred (bl)) was termed as mstcn-abppred (cl). we re-trained this model on the abps and non-abps predicted by it in some antibacterial proteins. it has been demonstrated that the proposed model does not exhibit any statistically significant deterioration in performance after extensive re-training, and it gains additional skills compared to the mstcn-abppred (bl). we have also deployed a freely accessible web application based on our final model, available at https://mstcn-abppred.anvil.app/, which can identify and discover abps in a protein using which the model gets re-trained on its own.",AB_0063
"there are a number of antigens that induce autoimmune response against beta-cells, leading to type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm). recently, several antigen -specific immunotherapies have been developed to treat t1dm. thus, identification of t1dm associated peptides with antigenic regions or epitopes is important for peptide based -therapeutics (e.g. immunotherapeutic). in this study, for the first time, an attempt has been made to develop a method for predicting, designing, and scanning of t1dm associated peptides with high precision. we analysed 815 t1dm associated peptides and observed that these peptides are not associated with a specific class of hla alleles. thus, hla binder prediction methods are not suitable for predicting t1dm associated peptides. first, we developed a similarity/alignment based method using basic local alignment search tool and achieved a high probability of correct hits with poor coverage. second, we developed an alignment -free method using machine learning techniques and got a maximum auroc of 0.89 using dipeptide composition. finally, we developed a hybrid method that combines the strength of both alignment free and alignment-based methods and achieves maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.95 with matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.81 on an independent dataset. we developed a web server `dmppred' and stand-alone server for predicting, designing and scanning t1dm associated peptides (https://webs.iiitd.edu.iniraghavaidmppredi).",AB_0063
"this paper describes a method pprint2, which is an improved version of pprint developed for predicting rna -interacting residues in a protein. training and independent/validation datasets used in this study comprises of 545 and 161 non -redundant rna -binding proteins, respectively. all models were trained on training dataset and evaluated on the validation dataset. the preliminary analysis reveals that positively charged amino acids such as h, r and k, are more prominent in the rna-interacting residues. initially, machine learning based models have been developed using binary profile and obtain maximum area under curve (auc) 0.68 on validation dataset. the performance of this model improved significantly from auc 0.68 to 0.76, when evolutionary profile is used instead of binary profile. the performance of our evolutionary profile -based model improved further from auc 0.76 to 0.82, when convolutional neural network has been used for developing model. our final model based on convolutional neural network using evolutionary information achieved auc 0.82 with matthews correlation coefficient of 0.49 on the validation dataset. our best model outperforms existing methods when evaluated on the independent/validation dataset. a user-friendly standalone software and web -based server named `pprint2' has been developed for predicting rna -interacting residues (https://websiiitd.eduintraghavaipprint2 and https://github.comiraghavagpsi pprint2).",AB_0063
"circulating tumor dna (ctdna) is a promising new biomarker with multiple potential applications in cancer care. estimating total cost of ctdna testing is necessary for reimbursement and implementation, but chal-lenging because of variations in workflow. we aimed to develop a micro-costing framework for consistent cost calculation of ctdna testing. first, the foundation of the framework was built, based on the complete step-wise diagnostic workflow of ctdna testing. second, the costing method was set up, including costs for personnel, materials, equipment, overhead, and failures. third, the framework was evaluated by experts and applied to six case studies, including pcr-, mass spectrometry-, and next-generation sequencing-based platforms, from three dutch hospitals. the developed ctdna micro-costing framework includes the diag-nostic workflow from blood sample collection to diagnostic test result. the framework was developed from a dutch perspective and takes testing volume into account. an open access tool is provided to allow for laboratory-specific calculations to explore the total costs of ctdna testing specific workflow parameters matching the setting of interest. it also allows to straightforwardly assess the impact of alternative prices or assumptions on the cost per sample by simply varying the input parameters. the case studies showed a wide range of costs, from euro168 to euro7638 ($199 to $9124) per sample, and generated information. these costs are sensitive to the (coverage of) platform, setting, and testing volume.

"the current study aims to develop a pan india database of medicinal plants along with their phytochemicals and geographical availability. the database consists of 6959 unique medicinal plants belonging to 348 families which are available across 28 states and 8 union territories of india. the database sources the information on four different sections - traditional knowledge, geographical indications, phytochemicals, and chemoinformatics. the traditional knowledge reports the plant taxonomy with their vernacular names. a total of 27,440 unique phytochemicals associated with these plants were curated from various sources in this study. however, due to the non-availability of general information like iupac names, inchi key, etc. from reliable sources, only 22,314 phytochemicals have been currently reported in the database. various analyses have been performed for the phytochemicals which include analysis of physicochemical and admet properties calculated from open-source web servers using in-house python scripts. the phytochemical data set has also been classified based on the class, superclass, and pathways respectively using npclassifier, a deep learning framework. additionally, the antiviral potency of the phytochemicals was also predicted using two machine learning models - random forest and xgboost. the database aims to provide accurate and exhaustive data of the traditional practice of medicinal plants in india in a single platform integrating and analyzing the rich customary practices and facilitating the development and identification of plant-based therapeutics for a variety of diseases. the database can be accessed at https://neist.res.in/osadhi/.",AB_0063
"the inference of large-scale gene regulatory networks is essential for understanding comprehensive interactions among genes. most existing methods are limited to reconstructing networks with a few hundred nodes. therefore, parallel computing paradigms must be leveraged to construct large networks. we propose a generic parallel framework that enables any existing method, without re engineering, to infer large networks in parallel, guaranteeing quality output. the framework is tested on 15 inference methods (not limited to) employing in silico benchmarks and real -world large expression matrices, followed by qualitative and speedup assessment. the framework does not compromise the quality of the base serial inference method. we rank the candidate methods and use the top performing method to infer an alzheimer's disease (ad) affected network from large expression profiles of a triple transgenic mouse model consisting of 45,101 genes. the resultant network is further explored to obtain hub genes that emerge functionally related to the disease. we partition the network into 41 modules and conduct pathway enrichment analysis, revealing that a good number of participating genes are collectively responsible for several brain disorders, including ad. finally, we extract the interactions of a few known ad genes and observe that they are periphery genes connected to the network's hub genes. availability: the r implementation of the framework is downloadable from https://github.com/netralab/genericparallelframework.",AB_0063
"intelligent uav video analysis has drawn the attention of many researchers due to the increasing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) in computer vision-related applications. applications such as search and rescue, the military, and surveillance demand automatic detection of human targets in large-scale uav images, which is very challenging due to the small size and inadequate feature representation of person objects. despite the significant advancements in generic object detection tasks, the performance of the state-of-the-art small object detection algorithms falls below the satisfactory level due to the lack of a representative dataset and the limited information available for small objects. to facilitate advancements in uav and small object detection research, we present a manipal-uav person detection dataset1 collected from two uavs flying at varying altitudes, locations, and weather conditions. the dataset contains 13,462 sampled images from 33 videos having 1,53,112 person object instances. the videos are captured in an unconstrained environment with complex scenes covering small objects of varying scales, poses, illumination, and occlusion, making person detection extremely challenging on this newly created dataset. this article compares the characteristics of the manipal-uav dataset with the standard visdrone and okutama datasets having aerial view person objects. in addition, it provides baseline evaluation results of the various state-of-the-art object detection algorithms applied to the newly created manipal-uav person detection dataset. the dataset is made publicly available at https://github.com/akshathakrbhat/manipal-uav-person-dataset.",AB_0063
"we propose a novel deep neural network architecture to learn interpretable representation for medical image analysis. our architecture generates a global attention for region of interest, and then learns bag of words style deep feature embeddings with local attention. the global, and local feature maps are combined using a contemporary transformer architecture for highly accurate gallbladder cancer (gbc) detection from ultrasound (usg) images. our experiments indicate that the detection accuracy of our model beats even human radiologists, and advocates its use as the second reader for gbc diagnosis. bag of words embeddings allow our model to be probed for generating interpretable explanations for gbc detection consistent with the ones reported in medical literature. we show that the proposed model not only helps understand decisions of neural network models but also aids in discovery of new visual features relevant to the diagnosis of gbc. source-code is available at https://github.com/sbasu276/radformer.",AB_0063
"we use in situ data from the wind spacecraft (https://wind.nasa.gov/) to survey the amplitude of turbulent fluctuations in the proton density and total magnetic field inside a large sample of near-earth magnetic clouds (mcs) associated with coronal mass ejections (cmes) from the sun. we find that the most probable value of the modulation index for proton density fluctuations (delta n(p)/n(p)) inside mcs ranges from 0.13 to 0.16, while the most probable values for the modulation index of the total magnetic field fluctuations (delta b/b) range from 0.04 to 0.05. we also find that the most probable value of the mach number fluctuations (delta m) inside mcs is approximate to 0.1. the anomalous resistivity inside the near-earth mcs arising from electron scattering due to turbulent magnetic field fluctuations exceeds the (commonly used) spitzer resistivity by a factor of approximate to 500-1000. the enhanced joule heating arising from this anomalous resistivity could impact our understanding of the energetics of cme propagation.",AB_0063
