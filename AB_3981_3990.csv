"in the broad and complex field of biological data analysis, researchers frequently gather information from a single source or database. despite being a widespread practice, this has disadvantages. relying exclusively on a single source can limit our comprehension as it may omit various per-spectives that could be obtained by combining multiple knowledge bases. acknowledging this shortcoming, we report on mirgedinet, a novel approach combining information from three biological databases. our investigation focuses on micrornas (mirnas), small non-coding rna molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. we delve deeply into the knowledge of these mirna's interactions with genes and the possible effects these interactions may have on different diseases. the scientific community has long recognized a direct correlation between the progression of specific diseases and mirnas, as well as the genes they target. by using mirgedinet, we go beyond simply acknowledging this relationship. rather, we actively look for the critical genes that could act as links between the actions of mirnas and the mechanisms underlying disease. our methodology, which carefully identifies and investigates these important genes, is supported by a strategic framework that may open up new possibilities for comprehending diseases and creating treatments. we have developed a tool on the knime platform as a concrete application of our research. this tool serves as both a validation of our study and an invitation to the larger community to interact with, investigate, and build upon our findings. mirgedinet is publicly accessible on github at https://github.com/malikyousef/mirgedinet, providing a collaborative environment for additional research and innovation for enthusiasts and fellow researchers.",AB_0399
"background:hospitalization is recognized as a sentinel event in the disease trajectory of patients with heart failure (hf), but not all patients experiencing clinical decompensation are ultimately hospitalized. outpatient intensification of diuretics is common in response to symptoms of worsening hf, yet its prognostic and clinical relevance, specifically for patients with hf with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, is uncertain.methods:in this prespecified analysis of the deliver trial (dapagliflozin evaluation to improve the lives of patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure), we assessed the association between various nonfatal worsening hf events (those requiring hospitalization, urgent outpatient visits requiring intravenous hf therapies, and outpatient oral diuretic intensification) and rates of subsequent mortality. we further examined the treatment effect of dapagliflozin on an expanded composite end point of cardiovascular death, hf hospitalization, urgent hf visit, or outpatient oral diuretic intensification.results:in deliver, 4532 (72%) patients experienced no worsening hf event, whereas 789 (13%) had outpatient oral diuretic intensification, 86 (1%) required an urgent hf visit, 585 (9%) had an hf hospitalization, and 271 (4%) died of cardiovascular causes as a first presentation. patients with a first presentation manifesting as outpatient oral diuretic intensification experienced rates of subsequent mortality that were higher (10 [8-12] per 100 patient-years) than those without a worsening hf event (4 [3-4] per 100 patient-years) but similar to rates of subsequent death after an urgent hf visit (10 [6-18] per 100 patient-years). patients with an hf hospitalization as a first presentation of worsening hf had the highest rates of subsequent death (35 [31-40] per 100 patient-years). the addition of outpatient diuretic intensification to the adjudicated deliver primary end point (cardiovascular death, hf hospitalization, or urgent hf visit) increased the overall number of patients experiencing an event from 1122 to 1731 (a 54% increase). dapagliflozin reduced the need for outpatient diuretic intensification alone (hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% ci, 0.64-0.82]) and when analyzed as a part of an expanded composite end point of worsening hf or cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% ci, 0.69-0.84]).conclusions:in patients with hf with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, worsening hf requiring oral diuretic intensification in ambulatory care was frequent, adversely prognostic, and significantly reduced by dapagliflozin.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct03619213.",AB_0399
"antiviral peptides (avps) are bioactive peptides that exhibit the inhibitory activity against viruses through a range of mechanisms. virus entry inhibitory peptides (veips) make up a specific class of avps that can prevent envelope viruses from entering cells. with the growing number of experimentally verified veips, there is an opportunity to use machine learning to predict peptides that inhibit the virus entry. in this paper, we have developed the first target-specific prediction model for the identification of new veips using, along with the peptide sequence characteristics, the attributes of the envelope proteins of the target virus, which overcomes the problem of insufficient data for particular viral strains and improves the predictive ability. the model's performance was evaluated through 10 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation on the training data set, and the results indicate that it can predict veips with 87.33% accuracy and matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) value of 0.76. the model also performs well on an independent test set with 90.91% accuracy and mcc of 0.81. we have also developed an automatic computational tool that predicts veips, which is freely available at https://dbaasp.org/tools?page=linear-amp-prediction.",AB_0399
"prior knowledge about dna-binding transcription factors (dbtfs), transcription co-regulators (cotfs) and general transcriptional factors (gtfs) is crucial for the study and understanding of the regulation of transcription. this is reflected by the many publications and database resources describing knowledge about tfs. we previously launched the tfcheckpoint database, an integrated resource focused on human, mouse and rat dbtfs, providing users access to a comprehensive overview of these proteins. here, we describe tfcheckpoint 2.0 (https://www.tfcheckpoint.org/index.php), comprising 13 collections of dbtfs, cotfs and gtfs. tfcheckpoint 2.0 provides an easy and versatile cross-referencing system for users to view and download collections that may otherwise be cumbersome to find, compare and retrieve. graphical abstract",AB_0399
"pathway data integration portal (pathdip) is an integrated pathway database that was developed to increase functional gene annotation coverage and reduce bias in pathway enrichment analysis. pathdip 5 provides multiple improvements to enable more interpretable analysis: users can perform enrichment analysis using all sources, separate sources or by combining specific pathway subsets; they can select the types of sources to use or the types of pathways for the analysis, reducing the number of resulting generic pathways or pathways not related to users' research question; users can use api. all pathways have been mapped to seven representative types. the results of pathway enrichment can be summarized through knowledge-based pathway consolidation. all curated pathways were mapped to 53 pathway ontology-based categories. in addition to genes, pathdip 5 now includes metabolites. we updated existing databases, included two new sources, pathbank and metabolicatlas, and removed outdated databases. we enable users to analyse their results using drugst.one, where a drug-gene network is created using only the user's genes in a specific pathway. interpreting the results of any analysis is now improved by multiple charts on all the results pages. pathdip 5 is freely available at https://ophid.utoronto.ca/pathdip. graphical abstract",AB_0399
"parkinson's disease (pd) is characterized by the progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration, resulting in striatal dopamine deficiency. mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with pd pathogenesis. physical activity (pa) has been shown to ameliorate neurological impairments and to impede age-related neuronal loss. in addition, skin fibroblasts have been identified as surrogate indicators of pathogenic processes correlating with clinical measures. the parkex study aims to compare the effects of two different pa programs, analyzing the impact on mitochondrial function in patients' skin fibroblasts as biomarkers for disease status and metabolic improvement. early-stage pd patients (n = 24, h&y stage i to iii) will be randomized into three age- and sex-matched groups. group 1 (n = 8) will undergo basic physical training (bpt) emphasizing strength and resistance. group 2 (n = 8) will undergo bpt combined with functional exercises (bptfe), targeting the sensorimotor pathways that are most affected in pd (proprioception-balance-coordination) together with cognitive and motor training (dual task training). group 3 (n = 8) will serve as control (sedentary group; sed). participants will perform three sessions per week for 12 weeks. assessment of motor function, quality of life, sleep quality, cognitive aspects and humor will be conducted pre- and post-intervention. patient skin fibroblasts will be collected before and after the intervention and characterized in terms of metabolic remodeling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. ethical approval has been given to commence this study. this trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (nct05963425).trial registration. https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/history/nct05963425.",AB_0399
"background:anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has a variable incidence, and the development of left ventricular dysfunction is preceded by elevations in cardiac troponin concentrations. beta-adrenergic receptor blocker and renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapies have been associated with modest cardioprotective effects in unselected patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy.methods:in a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial, patients with breast cancer and non-hodgkin lymphoma receiving anthracycline chemotherapy underwent serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before and 6 months after anthracycline treatment. patients at high risk of cardiotoxicity (cardiac troponin i concentrations in the upper tertile during chemotherapy) were randomized to standard care plus cardioprotection (combination carvedilol and candesartan therapy) or standard care alone. the primary outcome was adjusted change in left ventricular ejection fraction at 6 months. in low-risk nonrandomized patients with cardiac troponin i concentrations in the lower 2 tertiles, we hypothesized the absence of a 6-month change in left ventricular ejection fraction and tested for equivalence of +/- 2%.results:between october 2017 and june 2021, 175 patients (mean age, 53 years; 87% female; 71% with breast cancer) were recruited. patients randomized to cardioprotection (n=29) or standard care (n=28) had left ventricular ejection fractions of 69.4 +/- 7.4% and 69.1 +/- 6.1% at baseline and 65.7 +/- 6.6% and 64.9 +/- 5.9% 6 months after completion of chemotherapy, respectively. after adjustment for age, pretreatment left ventricular ejection fraction, and planned anthracycline dose, the estimated mean difference in 6-month left ventricular ejection fraction between the cardioprotection and standard care groups was -0.37% (95% ci, -3.59% to 2.85%; p=0.82). in low-risk nonrandomized patients, baseline and 6-month left ventricular ejection fractions were 69.3 +/- 5.7% and 66.4 +/- 6.3%, respectively: estimated mean difference, 2.87% (95% ci, 1.63%-4.10%; p=0.92, not equivalent).conclusions:combination candesartan and carvedilol therapy had no demonstrable cardioprotective effect in patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy with high-risk on-treatment cardiac troponin i concentrations. low-risk nonrandomized patients had similar declines in left ventricular ejection fraction, bringing into question the utility of routine cardiac troponin monitoring. furthermore, the modest declines in left ventricular ejection fraction suggest that the value and clinical impact of early cardioprotection therapy need to be better defined in patients receiving high-dose anthracycline.registration:url: https://doi.org; unique identifier: 10.1186/isrctn24439460. url: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search; unique identifier: 2017-000896-99.",AB_0399
"finding the best knockout strategy for coupling biomass growth and production of a target metabolite using a mathematic model of metabolism is a challenge in biotechnology. in this research, a three-step method named optenvelope is presented based on finding minimal set of active reactions for a target point in the feasible solution space (envelope) using a mixed-integer linear programming formula. the method initially finds the reduced desirable solution space envelope in the product versus biomass plot by removing all inactive reactions. then, with reinsertion of the deleted reactions, optenvelope attempts to reduce the number of knockouts so that the desirable production envelope is preserved. additionally, optenvelope searches for envelopes with higher minimum production rates or fewer knockouts by evaluating different target points within the desired solution space. it is possible to limit the maximal number of knockouts. the method was implemented on metabolic models of e. coli and s. cerevisiae to test the method benchmarking the capability of these industrial microbes for overproduction of acetate and glycerol under aerobic conditions and succinate and ethanol under anaerobic conditions. the results illustrate that optenvelope is capable to find multiple strong coupled envelopes located in the desired solution space because of its novel target point oriented strategy of envelope search. the results indicate that e. coli is more appropriate to produce acetate and succinate while s. cerevisiae is a better host for glycerol production. gene deletions for some of the proposed reaction knockouts have been previously reported to increase the production of these metabolites in experiments. both organisms are suitable for ethanol production, however, more knockouts for the adaptation of e. coli are required. optenvelope is available at https://github.com/lv-csbg/optenvelope.",AB_0399
"human genetic variants that introduce an ag into the intronic region between the branchpoint (bp) and the canonical splice acceptor site (acc) of protein- coding genes can disrupt pre-mrna splicing. using our genome-wide bp database, we delineated the bp-acc segments of all human introns and found extreme depletion of ag/yag in the [bp+8, acc-4] high -risk region. we developed again as a genome-wide computa-tional approach to systematically and precisely pinpoint intronic ag-gain variants within the bp-acc regions. again identified 350 ag-gain variants from the human gene mutation database, all of which alter splicing and cause disease. among them, 74% created new acceptor sites, whereas 31% resulted in complete exon skipping. again also predicts the protein -level products resulting from these two consequences. we performed again on our exome/genomes database of patients with severe infectious diseases but without known genetic etiology and identified a private homozygous intronic ag-gain variant in the antimycobacterial gene sppl2a in a patient with mycobacterial disease. again also predicts a retention of six intronic nucleotides that encode an in -frame stop codon, turning ag-gain into stop-gain. this allele was then confirmed experimentally to lead to loss of function by disrupting splicing. we further showed that ag-gain variants inside the high -risk region led to misspliced products, while those outside the region did not, by two case studies in genes stat1 and irf7. we finally evaluated again on our 14 paired exome- rnaseq samples and found that 82% of ag-gain variants in high -risk regions showed evidence of missplicing. again is publicly available from https://hgidsoft.rockefeller.edu/again and https://github.com/casanova- lab/again.",AB_0399
"jaspar (https://jaspar.elixir.no/) is a widely-used open-access database presenting manually curated high-quality and non-redundant dna-binding profiles for transcription factors (tfs) across taxa. in this 10th release and 20th-anniversary update, the core collection has expanded with 329 new profiles. we updated three existing profiles and provided orthogonal support for 72 profiles from the previous release's unvalidated collection. altogether, the jaspar 2024 update provides a 20% increase in core profiles from the previous release. a trimming algorithm enhanced profiles by removing low information content flanking base pairs, which were likely uninformative (within the capacity of the pfm models) for tfbs predictions and modelling tf-dna interactions. this release includes enhanced metadata, featuring a refined classification for plant tfs' structural dna-binding domains. the new jaspar collections prompt updates to the genomic tracks of predicted tf binding sites (tfbss) in 8 organisms, with human and mouse tracks available as native tracks in the ucsc genome browser. all data are available through the jaspar web interface and programmatically through its api and the updated bioconductor and pyjaspar packages. finally, a new tfbs extraction tool enables users to retrieve predicted jaspar tfbss intersecting their genomic regions of interest. graphical abstract",AB_0399
