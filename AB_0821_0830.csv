"background:anastomotic recurrence is thought to be caused by implantation of tumor cells to the anastomotic line; however, its risk factors and prognostic significance remain unclear. objective:this study aimed to clarify the risk factors for anastomotic recurrence in colorectal cancer and assess the prognosis in comparison to nonanastomotic local recurrence. design:a single-center retrospective observational study. settings:the medical records of the study participants were retrospectively collected from the department of surgical oncology at the university of tokyo hospital database. patients:this study included 1584 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between january 2005 and december 2017. we focused on 15 patients who had an anastomotic recurrence. main outcome measures:the main outcome measures were the risk factors of anastomotic recurrence at the primary resection and prognosis data in comparison to that of nonanastomotic local recurrence. results:there were 15 patients (0.95%) with anastomotic recurrence and 35 (2.21%) with nonanastomotic local recurrence. univariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis and advanced t stage are the risk factors for anastomotic recurrence. the prognosis of patients with anastomotic recurrence was similar to that of those with nonanastomotic local recurrence who underwent resection. limitations:the small number of patients with anastomotic recurrence is a major limitation of this study. additionally, the retrospective study design may have increased the risk of selection bias. conclusions:lymph node metastasis and advanced t stage were associated with anastomotic recurrence. the prognosis of patients with anastomotic recurrence was similar to that with resected nonanastomotic local recurrence. thus, surveillance should be carefully continued while considering the poor prognosis of patients with anastomotic recurrence. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c92.",AB_0083
"background: redo ileocolic resection for recurrent crohn's disease is associated with increased technical complexity and higher complication rates compared to primary resection. literature concerning redo surgery for recurrent crohn's disease is scarce and it is controversial whether a redo is a risk factor for postoperative anastomotic leak. objective: this study aimed to hypothesized that redo ileocolic resection for crohn's disease is an independent risk factor for anastomotic leak. design: retrospective, case-control study from 1994 to 2019 with multivariate analysis and propensity score weighting. setting: quaternary, ibd-referral center. patients: adult patients aged >18 years were included in the study. interventions: primary or redo ileocolic resection with an anastomosis, with or without diverting ileostomy. main outcome measures: thirty-day anastomotic leak rate. results: a total of 991 patients (56% primary and 44% redo ileocolic resections) were included. patients who underwent redo resection were significantly older with more comorbidities, fewer medications, and less fistulizing disease compared to the primary group. on univariate analysis, patients who underwent redo resection had more overall complications ( 50.5% vs 36.2%, p < 0.001), and the cumulative number of prior ileocolic resections was significantly associated with increased risk for overall morbidity (p < 0.001). there were 31 (3%) anastomotic leaks; leak rates did not differ between groups (p = 0.60). multivariable analysis indicated that extensive adhesiolysis (p < 0.001), ileostomy omission (p = 0.009), and intraoperative abscess/ fistula (p = 0.02) were independently associated with leaks but not redo resection (p = 0.27). patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 of these risk factors had observed leak rates of 1.1%, 1.3%, 6.0%, and 11.6.% (p = 0.03), respectively. limitations: the limitations of this study were selection bias, referral bias, and single quaternary center. conclusions: compared to primary procedures, redo ileocolic resection for recurrent crohn's disease is associated with increased overall morbidity but not anastomotic leak. see video abstract at http://links.lww. com/dcr/c132.",AB_0083
"objective:to comprehensively report complications associated with pelvic exenteration and to determine the strength of associations between 3 different grading methodologies and length of stay, quality of life, and physical outcomes. background:it is generally accepted that pelvic exenteration is associated with high rates of surgical morbidity. however, methods of reporting in the literature are inconsistent, making it difficult to compare surgical outcomes across studies to determine the impact of surgery on patients. design:a retrospective study. settings:this study was conducted at royal prince alfred hospital, sydney, australia. patients:it included patients who underwent pelvic exenteration between december 2016 and august 2019. main outcome measures:complications were classified according to the clavien-dindo classification, comprehensive complication index, and number of postoperative complications. correlations between length of stay, physical component score, 6-minute walk test, and sit-to-stand test, and complications as graded using the clavien-dindo classification, comprehensive complication index, and the number of complications were explored using pearson's or point biserial correlation tests. results:in this study, 198 patients were included. the clavien-dindo classification was moderately positively correlated with length of stay (r = 0.519; p < 0.0001), whereas comprehensive complication index (r = 0.744; p < 0.0001) and the number of complications (r = 0.751; p < 0.0001) showed a strong correlation with length of stay. all these methodologies were moderately inversely correlated with a predischarge 6-minute walk test (clavien-dindo classification: r = -0.359, p = 0.008; comprehensive complication index: r = -0.388, p = 0.007; number of complications: r = -0.467, p < 0.0001). limitations:this single-center retrospective study involves a small sample size. classification of grade i and ii complications in this cohort of patients who tend to have complex postoperative recovery was challenging and therefore incomplete. the incomplete data may have affected the correlations. conclusions:comprehensive complication index and the number of postoperative complications were more strongly correlated with length of stay than the clavien-dindo classification in patients undergoing pelvic exenteration. comprehensive complication index may be a better grading system to classify postoperative complications following pelvic exenteration. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/b906.",AB_0083

"on-device session-based recommendation systems have been achieving increasing attention on account of the low energy/resource consumption and privacy protection while providing promising recommendation performance. to fit the powerful neural session-based recommendation models in resource-constrained mobile devices, tensor-train decomposition and its variants have been widely applied to reduce memory footprint by decomposing the embedding table into smaller tensors, showing great potential in compressing recommendation models. however, these model compression techniques significantly increase the local inference time due to the complex process of generating index lists and a series of tensor multiplications to form item embeddings. the resultant on-device recommender fails to provide real-time responses and recommendations. to improve the online recommendation efficiency, we propose to learn compositional encoding-based compact item representations. specifically, each item is represented by a compositional code that consists of several codewords, and we learn embedding vectors to represent each codeword instead of each item. then the composition of the codeword embedding vectors from different embedding matrices (i.e., codebooks) forms the item embedding. since the size of codebooks can be extremely small, the recommender model is thus able to fit in resource-constrained devices and save the codebooks for fast local inference. in addition, to prevent the loss of model capacity caused by compression, we propose a bidirectional self-supervised knowledge distillation framework. extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that compared with existing methods, the proposed on-device recommender not only achieves an 8x inference speedup with a large compression ratio but also shows superior recommendation performance. the code is released at https://github.com/xiaxin1998/eodrec.",AB_0083
"non-coding rnas (ncrnas) act as important modulators of gene expression and they have been confirmed to play critical roles in the physiology and development of malignant tumors. understanding the synergism of multiple ncrnas in competing endogenous rna (cerna) regulation can provide important insights into the mechanisms of malignant tumors caused by ncrna regulation. in this work, we present a framework, scom, for identifying ncrna synergistic competition. we systematically construct the landscape of ncrna synergistic competition across 31 malignant tumors, and reveal that malignant tumors tend to share hub ncrnas rather than the ncrna interactions involved in the synergistic competition. in addition, the synergistic competition ncrnas (i.e. ncrnas involved in the synergistic competition) are likely to be involved in drug resistance, contribute to distinguishing molecular subtypes of malignant tumors, and participate in immune regulation. furthermore, scom can help to infer ncrna synergistic competition across malignant tumors and uncover potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of malignant tumors. altogether, the scom framework (https://github.com/zhangjunpeng411/scom/) and the resulting web-based database scomdb (https://comblab.cn/scomdb/) serve as a useful resource for exploring ncrna regulation and to accelerate the identification of carcinogenic biomarkers. abundant evidence reveals that ncrnas are important modulators of gene expression, and it is important for us to understand the regulation of ncrnas in malignant tumors. in this work, we hypothesize that ncrnas acting as cernas can crosstalk with each other in the form of synergistic competition. we name the hypothesis as the ncrna synergistic competition hypothesis. to uncover potential carcinogenic biomarkers, we present a framework, scom, for identifying ncrna synergistic competition in malignant tumors. from the perspective of synergistic competition, we have shown that the synergistic competition ncrnas are likely to involve in drug resistance, contribute to distinguishing molecular subtypes of malignant tumors, and participate in immune regulation. in addition, the synergistic competition ncrnas are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of malignant tumors. we believe that the proposed framework scom and the web-based database scomdb can contribute to the design of reliable diagnosis and treatment biomarkers for malignant tumors.",AB_0083
"introductionthe feasibility and efficacy of surgical resection following systemic therapy for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) beyond the up-to-7 criteria is unclear. the combination of lenvatinib (len) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (tace), termed len-tace sequential therapy, has shown a high response rate and survival benefit in patients with intermediate-stage hcc. this trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of len-tace sequential therapy and the feasibility of surgical resection for intermediate-stage hcc beyond the up-to-7 criteria.methods and analysisthis is a multicentre, single-arm, prospective clinical trial. thirty patients with intermediate-stage hcc beyond the up-to-7 criteria will be enrolled. patients eligible for this study will undergo len-tace sequential therapy in which len is administered for 4 weeks, followed by tace, and then further len for another 4 weeks. patients will be assessed for efficacy of len-tace sequential therapy and resectability, and surgical resection will be performed if the hcc is considered radically resectable. the primary outcome of this study is the resection rate after len-tace sequential therapy. the secondary outcomes are the objective response rate of len-tace sequential therapy, safety, curative resection rate, overall survival and recurrence-free survival.ethics and disseminationthis trial was approved by the institutional review board of hiroshima university, japan (approval no. crb210003), and has been registered with the japan registry of clinical trials (jrcts061220007). the results of this study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and shared with the scientific community at international conferences.trial registration numberjrcts061220007 (https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jrcts061220007).",AB_0083
"background: adrenal venous sampling is recommended for the identification of unilateral surgically curable primary aldosteronism but is often clinically useless, owing to failed bilateral adrenal vein cannulation.objectives: to investigate if only unilaterally selective adrenal vein sampling studies can allow the identification of the responsible adrenal.methods: among 1625 patients consecutively submitted to adrenal vein sampling in tertiary referral centers, we selected those with selective adrenal vein sampling results in at least one side; we used surgically cured unilateral primary aldosteronism as gold reference. the accuracy of different values of the relative aldosterone secretion index (rasi), which estimates the amount of aldosterone produced in each adrenal gland corrected for catheterization selectivity, was examined.results: we found prominent differences in rasi values distribution between patients with and without unilateral primary aldosteronism. the diagnostic accuracy of rasi values estimated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.714 and 0.855, respectively, in the responsible and the contralateral side; rasi values >2.55 and <= 0.96 on the former and the latter side furnished the highest accuracy for detection of surgically cured unilateral primary aldosteronism. moreover, in the patients without unilateral primary aldosteronism, only 20% and 16% had rasi values <= 0.96 and >2.55.conclusions: with the strength of a large real-life data set and use of the gold reference entailing an unambiguous diagnosis of unilateral primary aldosteronism, these results indicate the feasibility of identifying unilateral primary aldosteronism using unilaterally selective adrenal vein sampling results.registration: url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct01234220.",AB_0083
"an original math-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm, named quadratic interpolation optimization (qio), is proposed to address numerical optimization and engineering issues. the main inspiration behind qio is derived from mathematics, specifically the newly proposed generalized quadratic interpolation (gqi) method. this method overcomes the limitations of the traditional quadratic interpolation method to better find the minimizer of the quadratic function formed by any three points. the qio utilizes the gqi method as a promising searching mechanism for tackling various types of optimization problems. this searching mechanism delivers exploration and exploitation strategies, in which the minimizer provided by the gqi method assists the qio algorithm in exploring a promising region in unexplored areas and exploit the optimal solutions in promising regions. to evaluate qio's effectiveness, it is comprehensively compared with 12 other commonly used optimizers on 23 benchmark test functions and the cec-2014 test suite. ten engineering problems are also tested to assess qio's practicality. eventually, a real-world application of qio is presented in the operation management of a microgrid with an energy storage system. the results demonstrate that qio is a promising alternative for addressing practical challenges. the source code of qio is publicly available at https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/135627-quadratic-interpolation-optimization-qio.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0083
"automatic optimization methods for compounds in the vast compound space are important for drug discovery and material design. several machine learning-based molecular generative models for drug discovery have been proposed, but most of these methods generate compounds from scratch and are not suitable for exploring and optimizing user-defined compounds. in this study, we developed a compound optimization method based on molecular graphs using deep reinforcement learning. this method searches for compounds on a fragment-by-fragment basis and at high density by generating fragments to be added atom by atom. experimental results confirmed that the quantum electrodynamics (qed), the optimization target set in this study, was enhanced by searching around the starting compound. as a use case, we successfully enhanced the activity of a compound by targeting dopamine receptor d2 (drd2). this means that the generated compounds are not structurally dissimilar from the starting compounds, as well as increasing their activity, indicating that this method is suitable for optimizing molecules from a given compound. the source code is available at https://github.com/sekijima-lab/gargoyles.",AB_0083
