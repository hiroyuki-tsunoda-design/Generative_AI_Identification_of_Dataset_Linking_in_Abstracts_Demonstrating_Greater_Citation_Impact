"cellular transitions hold great promise in translational medicine research. however, therapeutic applications are limited by the low efficiency and safety concerns of using transcription factors. small molecules provide a temporal and highly tunable approach to overcome these issues. here, we present pc3t, a computational framework to enrich molecules that induce desired cellular transitions, and pc3t was able to consistently enrich small molecules that had been experimentally validated in both bulk and single-cell datasets. we then predicted small molecule reprogramming of fibroblasts into hepatic progenitor-like cells (hplcs). the converted cells exhibited epithelial cell-like morphology and hplc-like gene expression pattern. hepatic functions were also observed, such as glycogen storage and lipid accumulation. finally, we collected and manually curated a cell state transition resource containing 224 time-course gene expression datasets and 153 cell types. our framework, together with the data resource, is freely available at http://pc3t.idrug.net.cn/. we believe that pc3t is a powerful tool to promote chemical-induced cell state transitions. pc3t is an in silico chemical screening pipeline to identify small-molecule treatments that induce cell state transitions for any given initial and terminal state or any intermediate state in the cell transition trajectory.",AB_0143
"rice farming exemplifies intensive agriculture, demanding significant inputs to achieve optimal yields. thus, accurate and precise mapping of rice cultivation is vital for effective agricultural management and food security. however, such studies have been limited by the challenges of obtaining optical cloud-free data and dealing with radar data's speckle noise. identifying crops using a single data source poses many difficulties. additionally, acquiring sufficient representative training samples that accurately reflect diverse phenological patterns is challenging for large-scale monitoring and rice cultivation classification. to address these challenges, this study proposed a fully automated rice-mapping framework (farm) that combines the strengths of time-series synthetic aperture radar (sar) and optical satellite imagery for large-scale rice mapping without manual sample collection. first, an object-based, fully automatic training sample generation strategy is introduced. the phenology constraint rule, based on time-series sar satellite images and specific rice-flooding features, is used to extract rice sample objects. second, the extracted rice sample objects, adhering to phenological rules, serve as training samples for paddy rice extraction by integrating multiple random forest (rf) classifiers, referred to as the multirf method, where each rf is individually built using images acquired during each phenological phase of the growing season. furthermore, the study explored the availability of the method in early-season rice identification by transferring the training samples acquired by the farm to a new year. the proposed farm approach was then validated under different cropping conditions at three study sites in china and two sites in other countries. the results showed that the farm framework proved to be more effective than other methods at all five study sites, achieving average overall accuracies (oa) ranging from 89.67%-97.00%. in addition, when transferring the training samples from 2021 to other years (2020/2022), the oas of site a, site b and site c were high during the heading period, with accuracies of 97.57%, 84.28% and 89.27%, respectively. these results demonstrated that, first, the farm framework exhibits high efficiency and accuracy in different study areas without the need for extensive fieldwork to collect training samples. second, the method has good performance in the early-season rice mapping of the new year and can be used to perform timely and accurate rice identification and monitoring tasks. the method shows great potential in obtaining large-area automatic rice mapping results in a timely and accurate manner. the latest release of farm can be viewed at https://feature-selected.users.earthengine.app/ view/farm, and the code is available on github at the link https://github.com/gactyxc/farm.git.",AB_0143
"table filling based joint named entity recognition and relation extraction task aims to share representation of subtasks in a table to extract structured knowledge. however, most of existing studies need additional labels and dedicated deep neural networks to learn shared representation, imposing heavy burdens to decoders. more seriously, almost all these models suffer from feature confusion problem, failing to capture purified task-specific features from shared representation to perform subtasks. to address these challenging problems, in this paper we propose a novel and effective deep purified feature mining (dream) model for joint named entity recognition and relation extraction task, which can automatically capture purified task-specific features to improve the classification performance of subtasks. specifically, unlike introducing additional labels or dedicated network architectures, we design a new lightweight shared representation learning (lsrl) module by the plainest labels of joint task and thus encodes context by the hybrid convolutional neural networks. afterwards, a task -aware information bottleneck (tib) module is proposed to explore the relation between the mutual information of the joint distribution of each subtask and its task-specific features. with the above two modules well obtain shared representation and purified task-specific features, the satisfactory classification results of both subtasks can be guaranteed. experiment results show that the proposed model is highly effective, obtaining the promising results on three different benchmarks: connl04 (general text), ade (biomedical text) and scierc (scientific text). for example, dream respectively achieves f1-scores of 78.18%, 80.28% and 44.60% in performing the relation extraction subtask on the connl04, ade and scierc datasets. the promising performance indicates that the proposed model can be applied to many practical applications such as biomedical information extraction. the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/swt-aiteam/dream.",AB_0143
"cardiac diseases have high mortality rates and are a significant threat to human health. echocardiography is a commonly used imaging technique to diagnose cardiac diseases because of its portability, non-invasiveness and low cost. precise segmentation of basic cardiac structures is crucial for cardiologists to efficiently diagnose cardiac diseases, but this task is challenging due to several reasons, such as: (1) low image contrast, (2) incomplete structures of cardiac, and (3) unclear border between the ventricle and the atrium in some echocardiographic images. in this paper, we applied contrastive learning strategy and proposed a semi-supervised method for echocardiographic images segmentation. this proposed method solved the above challenges effectively and made use of unlabeled data to achieve a great performance, which could help doctors improve the accuracy of cvd diagnosis and screening. we evaluated this method on a public dataset (camus), achieving mean dice similarity coefficient (dsc) of 0.898, 0.911, 0.916 with 1/4, 1/2 and full labeled data on two-chamber (2ch) echocardiography images, and of 0.903, 0.921, 0.928 with 1/4, 1/2 and full labeled data on four-chamber (4ch) echocardiography images. compared with other existing methods, the proposed method had fewer parameters and better performance. the code and models are available at https://github.com/gpgzy/cl-cardiac-segmentation.",AB_0143
"precise semantic representation is important for allowing machines to truly comprehend the meaning of natural language text, especially biomedical literature. although the semantic relations among words in a single sentence may be accurately represented with existing approaches, relations between two sentences cannot yet be accurately modeled, which leads to a lack of contextual information and difficulty in performing interpretable semantic inference. additionally, it is challenging to merge semantic representations curated by different experts. these critical challenges are insufficiently addressed by existing methods. in this paper, we present a framework for structured semantic representation (fssr) to address these issues. fssr uses a double-layer structure construct that combines paradigm and instance to represent the semantics of a word or a sentence. it uses six types of rules to represent the semantic relations between sentence constructs and uses a computational model to represent an action. fssr is a graph-based representation of semantics, in which a node represents a construct or a paradigm. two nodes are connected by an edge (a rule). in addition, fssr enables interpretable inference and active acquisition of new information, as illustrated in a case study. this case study models the semantics of a cancer prognostic analysis article and reproduces its text results and charts. we provide a website that visualizes the inference process (http://cragraph.synergylab.cn).",AB_0143
"background alzheimer's disease (ad), parkinson's disease (pd), and multiple sclerosis (ms) are three nervous system diseases that partially overlap clinically and genetically. however, bulk rna-sequencing did not accurately detect the core pathogenic molecules in them. the availability of high-quality single cell rna-sequencing data of post-mortem brain collections permits the generation of a large-scale gene expression in different cells in human brain, focusing on the molecular features and relationships between diseases and genes. we integrated single-nucleus rna-sequencing (snrna-seq) datasets of human brains with ad, pd, and ms to identify transcriptomic commonalities and distinctions among them.methods the snrna-seq datasets were downloaded from gene expression omnibus (geo) database. the seurat package was used for snrna-seq data processing. the uniform manifold approximation and projection (umap) were utilized for cluster identification. the findmarker function in seurat was used to identify the differently expressed genes. functional enrichment analysis was carried out using the gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) and gene ontology (go). the protein-protein interaction (ppi) analysis of differentially expressed genes (degs) was analyzed using string database (http://string-db.org). scenic analysis was performed using utilizing pyscenic (v0.10.0) based on the hg19-tss-centered-10 kb-10species databases. the analysis of potential therapeutic drugs was analyzed on connectivity map (https://clue.io).results the gene regulatory network analysis identified several hub genes regulated in ad, pd, and ms, in which hspb1 and hspa1a were key molecules. these upregulated hsp family genes interact with ribosome genes in ad and ms, and with immunomodulatory genes in pd. we further identified several transcriptional regulators (spi1, cebpa, tfe3, grhpr, and tp53) of the hub genes, which has important implications for uncovering the molecular crosstalk among ad, pd, and ms. arctigenin was identified as a potential therapeutic drug for ad, pd, and ms.conclusions together, the integrated snrna-seq data and findings have significant implications for unraveling the shared and unique molecular crosstalk among ad, pd, and ms. hspb1 and hspa1a as promising targets involved in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. additionally, the identification of arctigenin as a potential therapeutic drug for ad, pd, and ms further highlights its potential in treating these neurological disorders. these discoveries lay the groundwork for future research and interventions to enhance our understanding and treatment of ad, pd, and ms.",AB_0143

"background: spatial transcriptomics technologies fully utilize spatial location information, tissue morphological features, and transcriptional profiles. integrating these data can greatly advance our understanding about cell biology in the morphological background. methods: we developed an innovative spatial clustering method called stgnnks by combining graph neural network, denoising auto-encoder, and k-sums clustering. first, spatial resolved transcriptomics data are preprocessed and a hybrid adjacency matrix is constructed. next, gene expressions and spatial context are integrated to learn spots' embedding features by a deep graph infomax-based graph convolutional network. third, the learned features are mapped to a low-dimensional space through a zero-inflated negative binomial (zinb)-based denoising auto-encoder. fourth, a k-sums clustering algorithm is developed to identify spatial domains by combining k-means clustering and the ratio-cut clustering algorithms. finally, it implements spatial trajectory inference, spatially variable gene identification, and differentially expressed gene detection based on the pseudo-space-time method on six 10x genomics visium datasets. results: we compared our proposed stgnnks method with five other spatial clustering methods, ccst, seurat, stlearn, scanpy and sedr. for the first time, four internal indicators in the area of machine learning, that is, silhouette coefficient, the davies-bouldin index, the caliniski-harabasz index, and the s_dbw index, were used to measure the clustering performance of stgnnks with ccst, seurat, stlearn, scanpy and sedr on five spatial transcriptomics datasets without labels (i.e., adult mouse brain (ffpe), adult mouse kidney (ffpe), human breast cancer (block a section 2), human breast cancer (ffpe), and human lymph node). and two external indicators including adjusted rand index (ari) and normalized mutual information (nmi) were applied to evaluate the performance of the above six methods on human breast cancer (block a section 1) with real labels. the comparison experiments elucidated that stgnnks obtained the smallest daviesbouldin and s_dbw values and the largest silhouette coefficient, caliniski-harabasz, ari and nmi, significantly outperforming the above five spatial transcriptomics analysis algorithms. furthermore, we detected the top six spatially variable genes and the top five differentially expressed genes in each cluster on the above five unlabeled datasets. and the pseudo-space-time tree plot with hierarchical layout demonstrated a flow of human breast cancer (block a section 1) progress in three clades branching from three invasive ductal carcinoma regions to multiple ductal carcinoma in situ sub-clusters. conclusion: we anticipate that stgnnks can efficiently improve spatial transcriptomics data analysis and further boost the diagnosis and therapy of related diseases. the codes are publicly available at https://github. com/plhhnu/stgnnks.",AB_0143
"for many vision tasks and intelligent robotics applications, it is common that the scanned 3d point cloud is not complete, so inferring from the residual defect shape to the intact shape becomes an essential task. previous 3d completion neural network models generally use voxel-based or point-based methods to learn and process 3d data. for the voxel-based models, the computational cost and memory increase exponentially with the improvement of input resolution, and fine-grained features cannot be guaranteed in the completed point cloud due to limited computational resources. point-based models suffer from the lack of precision in feature acquisition and crude reconstruction of complicated structures, making it extremely hard to accomplish elaborated semantic shapes. combining advantages of voxel-based and point-based feature extraction through the highfrequency feature fusion module, this paper proposes a dual-scale point cloud completion network called dsnet, which performs global feature analysis at the voxel scale, and local feature analysis at the point cloud scale. the fused features are then integrated into the decoding and generation process, so as to complete the point cloud completion task from coarse to fine. experimental results, at both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, in several prevailing datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art point cloud completion networks and has a good generalization performance. code is available at https://github.com/ engqing/dsnet.",AB_0143
