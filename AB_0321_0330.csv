"advances in sequencing technologies have led to the rapid growth of multi-omics data on rheumatoid arthritis (ra). however, a comprehensive database that systematically collects and classifies the scattered data is still lacking. here, we developed the rheumatoid arthritis bioinformatics center (rabc, http://www.onethird-lab.com/rabc/), the first multi-omics data resource platform (data hub) for ra. there are four categories of data in rabc: (i) 175 multi-omics sample sets covering transcriptome, epigenome, genome, and proteome; (ii) 175 209 differentially expressed genes (degs), 105 differentially expressed micrornas (dems), 18 464 differentially dna methylated (dnam) genes, 1 764 kegg pathways, 30 488 go terms, 74 334 snps, 242 779 eqtls, 105 m6a-snps and 18 491 669 meta-mqtls; (iii) prior knowledge on seven types of ra molecular markers from nine public and credible databases; (iv) 127 073 literature information from pubmed (from 1972 to march 2022). rabc provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading these data. in addition, a visualization module also supports users to generate graphs of analysis results by inputting personalized parameters. we believe that rabc will become a valuable resource and make a significant contribution to the study of ra.",AB_0033
"antimicrobial toxins help prokaryotes win competitive advantages in intraspecific or interspecific conflicts and are also a critical factor affecting the pathogenicity of many pathogens that threaten human health. although many studies have revealed that antagonism based on antimicrobial toxins plays a central role in prokaryotic life, a database on antimicrobial toxins remains lacking. here, we present the prokaryotic antimicrobial toxin database (pat, http://bioinfo.qd.sdu.edu.cn/pat/), a comprehensive data resource collection on experimentally validated antimicrobial toxins. pat has organized information, derived from the reported literature, on antimicrobial toxins, as well as the corresponding immunity proteins, delivery mechanisms, toxin activities, structural characteristics, sequences, etc. moreover, we also predict potential antimicrobial toxins in prokaryotic reference genomes and show the taxonomic information and environmental distribution of typical antimicrobial toxins. these details have been fully incorporated into the pat database, where users can browse, search, download, analyse and view informative statistics and detailed information. pat resources have already been used in our prediction and identification of prokaryotic antimicrobial toxins and may contribute to promoting the efficient investigation of antimicrobial toxin functions, the discovery of novel antimicrobial toxins, and an improved understanding of the biological roles and significance of these toxins.",AB_0033
"spatial omics is a rapidly evolving approach for exploring tissue microenvironment and cellular networks by integrating spatial knowledge with transcript or protein expression information. however, there is a lack of databases for users to access and analyze spatial omics data. to address this limitation, we developed aquila, a comprehensive platform for managing and analyzing spatial omics data. aquila contains 107 datasets from 30 diseases, including 6500+ regions of interest, and 15.7 million cells. the database covers studies from spatial transcriptome and proteome analyses, 2d and 3d experiments, and different technologies. aquila provides visualization of spatial omics data in multiple formats such as spatial cell distribution, spatial expression and colocalization of markers. aquila also lets users perform many basic and advanced spatial analyses on any dataset. in addition, users can submit their own spatial omics data for visualization and analysis in a safe and secure environment. finally, aquila can be installed as an individual app on a desktop and offers the restful api service for power users to access the database. overall, aquila provides a detailed insight into transcript and protein expression in tissues from a spatial perspective. aquila is available at https://aquila.cheunglab.org.",AB_0033
"a broad range of complex phenotypes are related to dysfunctions in brain (hereafter referred to as brain-related traits), including various mental and behavioral disorders and diseases of the nervous system. these traits in general share overlapping symptoms, pathogenesis, and genetic components. here, we present brain catalog (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/braincatalog), a comprehensive database aiming to delineate the genetic components of more than 500 gwas summary statistics datasets for brain-related traits from multiple aspects. first, brain catalog provides results of candidate causal variants, causal genes, and functional tissues and cell types for each trait identified by multiple methods using comprehensive annotation datasets (58 qtl datasets spanning 6 types of qtls). second, brain catalog estimates the snp-based heritability, the partitioning heritability based on functional annotations, and genetic correlations among traits. finally, through bidirectional mendelian randomization analyses, brain catalog presents inference of risk factors that are likely causal to each trait. in conclusion, brain catalog presents a one-stop shop for the genetic components of brain-related traits, potentially serving as a valuable resource for worldwide researchers to advance the understanding of how gwas signals may contribute to the biological etiology of brain-related traits.",AB_0033
"the efficacy and safety of drugs are widely known to be determined by their interactions with multiple molecules of pharmacological importance, and it is therefore essential to systematically depict the molecular atlas and pharma-information of studied drugs. however, our understanding of such information is neither comprehensive nor precise, which necessitates the construction of a new database providing a network containing a large number of drugs and their interacting molecules. here, a new database describing the molecular atlas and pharma-information of drugs (drugmap) was therefore constructed. it provides a comprehensive list of interacting molecules for >30 000 drugs/drug candidates, gives the differential expression patterns for >5000 interacting molecules among different disease sites, adme (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-relevant organs and physiological tissues, and weaves a comprehensive and precise network containing >200 000 interactions among drugs and molecules. with the great efforts made to clarify the complex mechanism underlying drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and rapidly emerging interests in artificial intelligence (ai)-based network analyses, drugmap is expected to become an indispensable supplement to existing databases to facilitate drug discovery. it is now fully and freely accessible at: https://idrblab.org/drugmap/",AB_0033
"chromatin loops (or chromatin interactions) are important elements of chromatin structures. disruption of chromatin loops is associated with many diseases, such as cancer and polydactyly. a few methods, including chia-pet, hichip and plac-seq, have been proposed to detect high-resolution, specific protein-mediated chromatin loops. with rapid progress in 3d genomic research, chia-pet, hichip and plac-seq datasets continue to accumulate, and effective collection and processing for these datasets are urgently needed. here, we developed a comprehensive, multispecies and specific protein-mediated chromatin loop database (chromloops, https:// 3dgenomics.hzau.edu.cn/chromloops), which integrated 1030 chia-pet, hichip and plac-seq datasets from 13 species, and documented 1 491 416 813 high-quality chromatin loops. we annotated genes and regions overlapping with chromatin loop anchors with rich functional annotations, such as regulatory elements (enhancers, super-enhancers and silencers), variations (common snps, somatic snps and eqtls), and transcription factor binding sites. moreover, we identified genes with high-frequency chromatin interactions in the collected species. in particular, we identified genes with high-frequency interactions in cancer samples. we hope that chromloops will provide a new platform for studying chromatin interaction regulation in relation to biological processes and disease.",AB_0033
"metalloenzymes are attractive research targets in fields of chemistry, biology, and medicine. given that metalloenzymes can manifest conservation of metal-coordination and ligand binding modes, the excavation and expansion of metalloenzyme-specific knowledge is of interest in bridging metalloenzyme-related fields. building on our previous metalloenzyme-ligand association database, melad, we have expanded the scope of metalloenzyme-specific knowledge and services, by forming a versatile platform, termed the metalloenzyme data bank and analysis (medba). the medba provides: (i) manual curation of metalloenzymes into different categories, that this m-i, m-ii and m-iii; (ii) comprehensive information on metalloenzyme activities, expression profiles, family and disease links; (iii) structural information on metalloenzymes, in particular metal binding modes; (iv) metalloenzyme substrates and bioactive molecules acting on metalloenzymes; (v) excavated metal-binding pharmacophores and (vi) analysis tools for structure/metal active site comparison and metalloenzyme profiling. the medba is freely available at https://medba.ddtmlab.org.",AB_0033
"structural variations (svs) play important roles in human evolution and diseases, but there is a lack of data resources concerning representative samples, especially for east asians. taking advantage of both next-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing data at the whole-genome level, we developed the database pgg.sv to provide a practical platform for both regionally and globally representative structural variants. in its current version, pgg.sv archives 584 277 svs obtained from whole-genome sequencing data of 6048 samples, including 1030 long-read sequencing genomes representing 177 global populations. pgg.sv provides (i) high-quality svs with fine-scale and precise genomic locations in both grch37 and grch38, covering underrepresented svs in existing sequencing and microarray data; (ii) hierarchical estimation of sv prevalence in geographical populations; (iii) informative annotations of sv-related genes, potential functions and clinical effects; (iv) an analysis platform to facilitate sv-based case-control association studies and (v) various visualization tools for understanding the sv structures in the human genome. taken together, pgg. sv provides a user-friendly online interface, easy-to-use analysis tools and a detailed presentation of results. pgg. sv is freely accessible via https://www.biosino.org/pggsv.",AB_0033
"widespread drug resistance has become the key issue in global healthcare. extensive efforts have been made to reveal not only diverse diseases experiencing drug resistance, but also the six distinct types of molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance. a database that describes a comprehensive list of diseases with drug resistance (not just cancers/infections) and all types of resistance mechanisms is now urgently needed. however, no such database has been available to date. in this study, a comprehensive database describing drug resistance information named 'dresis' was therefore developed. it was introduced to (i) systematically provide, for the first time, all existing types of molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance, (ii) extensively cover the widest range of diseases among all existing databases and (iii) explicitly describe the clinically/experimentally verified resistance data for the largest number of drugs. since drug resistance has become an ever-increasing clinical issue, dresis is expected to have great implications for future new drug discovery and clinical treatment optimization. it is now publicly accessible without any login requirement at: https://idrblab.org/dresis/ [graphics] .",AB_0033
"coronavirus has brought about three massive outbreaks in the past two decades. each step of its life cycle invariably depends on the interactions among virus and host molecules. the interaction between virus rna and host protein (ivrhp) is unique compared to other virus-host molecular interactions and represents not only an attempt by viruses to promote their translation/replication, but also the host's endeavor to combat viral pathogenicity. in other words, there is an urgent need to develop a database for providing such ivrhp data. in this study, a new database was therefore constructed to describe the interactions between coronavirus rnas and host proteins (covinter). this database is unique in (a) unambiguously characterizing the interactions between virus rna and host protein, (b) comprehensively providing experimentally validated biological function for hundreds of host proteins key in viral infection and (c) systematically quantifying the differential expression patterns (before and after infection) of these key proteins. given the devastating and persistent threat of coronaviruses, covinter is highly expected to fill the gap in the whole process of the 'molecular arms race' between viruses and their hosts, which will then aid in the discovery of new antiviral therapies. it's now free and publicly accessible at: https://idrblab.org/covinter/ [graphics] .",AB_0033
