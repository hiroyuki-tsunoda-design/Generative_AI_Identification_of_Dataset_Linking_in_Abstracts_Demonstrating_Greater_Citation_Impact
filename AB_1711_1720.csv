"introduction: transversus abdominis plane block (tapb) is now commonly administered for postoperative pain control and reduced opioid consumption in patients undergoing major colorectal surgeries, such as colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, and inflammatory bowel disease resection. however, there remain several controversies about the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic tapb compared to ultrasound-guided tapb. therefore, the aim of this study is to integrate both direct and indirect comparisons to identify a more effective and safer tapb approach. materials and methods: systematic electronic literature surveillance will be performed in the pubmed, embase, cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), and clinicaltrials.gov databases for eligible studies through july 31, 2023. the cochrane risk of bias version 2 (rob 2) and risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions (robins-i) tools will be applied to scrutinize the methodological quality of the selected studies. the primary outcomes will include (1) opioid consumption at 24 hours postoperatively and (2) pain scores at 24 hours postoperatively both at rest and at coughing and movement according to the numerical rating scale (nrs). additionally, the probability of tapb- related adverse events, overall postoperative 30-day complications, postoperative 30-day ileus, postoperative 30-day surgical site infection, postoperative 7-day nausea and vomiting, and length of stay will be analyzed as secondary outcome measures. the findings will be assessed for robustness through subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. data analyses will be performed using revman 5.4.1 and stata 17.0. p value of less than 0.05 will be defined as statistically significant. the certainty of evidence will be examined via the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (grade) working group approach. ethics and dissemination: owing to the nature of the secondary analysis of existing data, no ethical approval will be required. our meta-analysis will summarize all the available evidence for the effectiveness and safety of tapb approaches for minimally invasive colorectal surgery. high-quality peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences will facilitate disseminating the results of this study, which are expected to inform future clinical trials and help anesthesiologists and surgeons determine the optimal tailored clinical practice for perioperative pain management. systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ display_record.php?recordid=281720, identifier (crd42021281720).",AB_0172
"o-linked glycosylation is one of the most complex post-translational modifications (ptm) of human proteins modulating various cellular metabolic and signaling pathways. unlike n-glycosylation, the o-glycosylation has non-specific sequence features and unstable glycan core structure, which makes identification of o-glycosites more challenging either by experimental or computational methods. biochemical experiments to identify oglycosites in batches are technically and economically demanding. therefore, development of computationbased methods is greatly warranted. this study constructed a prediction model based on feature fusion for oglycosites linked to the threonine residues in homo sapiens. in the training model, we collected and sorted out high-quality human protein data with o-linked threonine glycosites. seven feature coding methods were fused to represent the sample sequence. by comparison of different algorithms, random forest was selected as the final classifier to construct the classification model. through 5-fold cross-validation, the proposed model, namely oglythr, performed satisfactorily on both training set (auc: 0.9308) and independent validation dataset (auc: 0.9323). compared with previously published predictors, o-glythr achieved the highest acc of 0.8475 on the independent test dataset. these results demonstrated the high competency of our predictor in identifying oglycosites on threonine residues. furthermore, a user-friendly webserver named o-glythr (http://cbcb.cdutcm. edu.cn/o-glythr/) was developed to assist glycobiologists in the research associated with glycosylation structure and function.",AB_0172
"smoke detection is a key process for fire warning systems. however, the existing smoke detection methods are insufficient to extract precise smoke features due to the smoke's transparency and variability. to solve this problem, we adopt the efficient yolox architecture and devise three strategies to enhance it. a self -cooperation mechanism is proposed to directly remove redundancy and then condense localization and semantic information. moreover, we utilize the light-weight self-attention mechanism to emphasize the meaningful features of smoke. finally, we equip the network with the piece-wise focal loss to consolidate its performance towards hard samples. the proposed method is termed as self-attention and self-cooperation yolox (sasc-yolox). in addition, we build a database that contains images from real scenes and manually annotate them, named annotated real smoke database of xi'an jiaotong university (xjtu-rs). sasc-yolox obtains 72.6% and 92.1% ap on our database and a synthetic database, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. extensive visualization experiments also validate that sasc-yolox has a strong feature extraction ability. code is available at https://github.com/jingjing-maker/sasc-yolox.",AB_0172
"the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for hematological malignancies is heavily dependent on the availability of suitable donors. haploidentical donor (hid) and matched sibling donor (msd) are two important donor options providing faster and easier sources of stem cells, however, due to confounding factors present in most retrospective studies, the validity of comparing outcomes between these two donor types remains uncertain. we conducted a post-hoc analysis of a prospective clinical trial (trial registration: chinese clinical trial registry; #chictroch-12002490; registered 22 february 2012; https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=7061) to compare outcomes of hid versus msd peripheral blood stem cell- derived transplants in patients with hematologic malignancies between 2015 and 2022. all hid-receiving patients had antithymocyte globulin-based conditioning. propensity score matching was employed to minimize potential confounding factors between the two cohorts. a total of 1060 patients were initially reviewed and then 663 patients were ultimately included in the analysis after propensity score matching. the overall survival, relapse-free survival, non-relapse mortality rate and cumulative incidence of relapse were similar between hid and msd cohorts. subgroup analysis revealed that patients with positive measurable residual disease in first complete remission may have better overall survival with an hid transplant. the present demonstrated that haploidentical transplants can provide outcomes comparable to conventional msd transplants, and hid should be recommended as one of the optimal donor choices for patients with positive measurable residual disease in first complete remission.",AB_0172
"mussels are globally distributed and abundant species on intertidal habitats such as rocky shores where they form dense beds and provide a variety of ecosystem services. the ability to measure mussel abundance on shores with high efficiency and accuracy will enhance assessment of their facilitative services to intertidal ecosystems. traditional sampling methods, however, are labour intensive and consequently limited in spatial and temporal coverage. to advance such monitoring and quantification processes, four state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (cnn); namely u-net, fastscnn, deeplab v3+, and hrnet, were compared in their performance to segment mussels at the pixel level either with or without cityscapes pre-trained weights. all proposed cnn were trained on a photographic dataset of 1455 images generated from field images of mussel beds. cnn trained with the cityscapes pre-trained weights showed an overall increased model performance as illustrated by mean intersection-over-union (miou), loss, overall accuracy (oacc), and cohen's kappa coefficient. deeplab v3+ and hrnet with the combination of cityscapes pre-trained weights achieved over 95% miou and 97% oacc for assessing distribution and abundance of these important intertidal species. such combination of approaches is, therefore, recommended for ecologists who wish to conduct image-driven surveys of intertidal ecosystems and the code for this study is available at: https://github.com/vicellken/cnn-ss-mussel.",AB_0172
"accurate segmenting regions of interest in various medical images are essential to clinical research and applications. although deep learning-based methods have achieved good results, the fully automated seg-mentation results still need to be refined on the tininess, complexities, and irregularities of lesion shapes. to address this issue, we propose a dual-stream representation fusion learning (drfl) paradigm for accurate clinical segmentation, including dual-stream fusion module, representation fusion transformer module and peakiness fusion attention module. specifically, dual-stream fusion module can simultaneously generate binary masks and high-resolution images with segmentation stream and super-resolution stream that share a feature extractor, then both prediction outputs are merged as the input of fusion module to further improve the performance of the network for generating the final segmentation result; representation fusion transformer module is lightweight to fuse high-resolution representation and fine-grained structure representation; peakiness fusion attention module can capture more salient features while fusing more spatial information to improve the performance of the network. the effectiveness of our dual-stream representation fusion learning is validated on different medical image segmentation tasks, and extensive experiments show that our drfl outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality of lung nodule segmentation, lung segmentation, cell contour segmentation, and prostate segmentation. our code is available at https://github.com/rongtao-xu/representationlearning/tree/main/drfl-eaai2023.",AB_0172
"background: the evaluation of liver fibrosis is essential in the management of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (aih). we aimed to establish and validate an easy-to-use nomogram to identify aih patients with advanced liver fibrosis. methods: aih patients who underwent liver biopsies were included and randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression was used to select independent predictors of advanced liver fibrosis from the training set, which were utilized to establish a nomogram. the performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the receiver characteristic curve (roc), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (dca). results: the median age of 235 patients with aih was 54 years old, with 83.0% of them being female. six independent factors associated with advanced fibrosis, including sex, age, red cell distribution width, platelets, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time, were combined to construct a predictive aih fibrosis (aihf)nomogram. the aihf- nomogram showed good agreement with real observations in the training and validation sets, according to the calibration curve. the aihf-nomogram performed significantly better than the fibrosis-4 and aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio scores in the training and validation sets, with an area under the rocs for predicting advanced fibrosis of 0.804 in the training set and 0.781 in the validation set. dca indicated that the aihfinomogram was clinically useful. the nomogram will be available at http:// ndth-zzy.shinyapps.io/aihf-nomogram/as a web-based calculator. conclusions: the novel, easy- to-use web-based aihf-nomogram model provides an insightful and applicable tool to identify aih patients with advanced liver fibrosis.",AB_0172
"trees are common natural objects widely distributed in urban areas. the modeling quality of trees has significant visual effects for urban modeling. tree models directly from the oblique photogrammetry pipeline are erratic because tree textures are repeating and confusing. existing tree modeling approaches either cannot deal with the input data of poor quality or are time-consuming. this paper presents an oblique photogrammetry-supporting procedural tree modeling approach to solve this problem. specifically, we propose a point cloud data -supported hybrid parametric model that models trees by simulating the growth of natural trees. to solve the challenging optimization problem in high dimensional space defined by the parametric model, a control parameter analysis (cpa)-based optimization method is proposed to find the approximate solution with the highest resemblance to the input data. finally, an automatic level of detail (lod) control method of tree models is proposed to form a complete workflow for rendering the urban scenes. experimental results indicate that the proposed method can generate procedural tree models in urban areas with satisfying accuracy and efficiency. the mean normalized distance between the generated tree models and input data in the test regions is 0.022, and it takes about ten minutes to generate each tree model. our code is available at https://github.com/lelle mu/procedrual_tree_modeling.",AB_0172
"thermo-lp (thermodynamics-linear programing) is a computational program written in c and python for evaluating the thermodynamic formability of max phases at the finite temperature, including configurational, electronic, and vibrational entropies. the program uses the phonon density of states (pdos) and electron density of states (edos) as the main inputs to obtain the gibbs free energy in a temperature range from 0 k to 2000 k for each crystal structure in the self-contained structural and thermodynamic data pool. thermo-lp offers a highly reliable evaluation of the overall thermodynamic stability of a target max phase with respect to many competing impurities using linear programing optimization algorithm. thermo-lp program is also capable to simultaneously compose and optimize the synthetic pathways for the target max phase due to the implementation of constrained linear programing procedure. the capabilities of thermo-lp program are demonstrated using the quaternary cr2tialc2 o-max compound as the typical example by successfully predicting the thermodynamically most feasible synthetic route, and the most likely impurities at 1724 k for the annealing temperature. program summary program title: thermo-lp cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /ykdpvcr8by.1 developer's repository link: https://gitlab .com /fxhln /thermo -lp .git licensing provisions: mit programming language: c and python nature of problem: evaluating the thermodynamic formability of a max phase and finding the most competing impurities associated with a specific synthetic pathway among many possible decomposition reactions requires an efficient and reliable searching algorithm within a large structural data pool.solution method: using phonon density of states and electron density of states as the main input data to calculate the finite-temperature corrections to gibbs free energy. utilizing the advanced linear programing optimization procedure to evaluate the overall thermodynamic formability of max phase with respect to competing impurities based on a self-built thermodynamic data pool.(c) 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0172
"train surface anomaly detection is an essential task in vision-based railway safety inspection. although existing deep learning methods show great potential, their anomaly detection accuracy is affected by the lack of abnormal images. the number of abnormal images on the train surface is far less than that of normal images. one effective way to solve this problem is to expand the abnormal sample. however, most of train surface anomaly image generation methods faces difficulties in producing images with high quality and rich diversity at the same time. in addition, generating small-area anomalies is not ideal. an anomaly-gan based on mask pool, abnormal aware loss, and local versus global discriminators is thus proposed in this paper to solve these problems. the mask pool consists of prior-knowledge-based masks and expert-experience-based masks that guide model in generating anomalies with different shapes, rotation angles, spatial locations, and part numbers. the anomaly aware loss focuses on small-area anomalies, thereby promoting the generated anomalies with more detailed textures and richer semantics. the local versus global consistency discriminators combine local and global feature expressions that lead to the generation of more realistic and natural abnormal samples. the experiments show that, compared with other advanced data augmentation algorithms, the images generated by anomaly-gan achieve the best fid and lpips scores in all anomaly categories. in addition, compared with the case without data augmentaion, the proposed data enhancement method improves the performance of cnn on map and miou by 25.6% and 24.2%, respectively. test code is available in https://github.com/ai-dream-chaser/anomaly-gan.",AB_0172
