"introduction heart failure (hf) with preserved ejection fraction (hfpef) has become the main type of hf worldwide. although large randomised controlled studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors among patients with hfpef, the mechanisms remain unclear. basic research suggests that empagliflozin inhibits myocardial fibrosis. myocardial extracellular volume (ecv) can be calculated using cardiac mri (cmri), which can reflect the degree of diffuse myocardial fibrosis. studies show that empagliflozin can reduce ecv and left ventricular mass (lvm) assessed by cmri in patients with diabetes with coronary heart disease and patients without diabetes with hf with reduced ejection fraction. however, whether empagliflozin reduces ecv and lvm among patients with hfpef is unclear. this study intends to use cmri to evaluate ecv and lvm, combined with echocardiography and an assessment of related biomarkers, to determine whether empagliflozin can improve myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular remodelling in patients with hfpef.methods and analysis this report describes the study design of a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel-group clinical study. a total of 180 participants with hfpef aged 40-80 years old who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly divided into an empagliflozin treatment group or a placebo control group. the empagliflozin treatment group will receive 10 mg of empagliflozin per day for 6 months in addition to guideline-directed medical treatment, while the control group will receive placebo oral administration with guideline-directed medical therapy for 6 months. the primary outcomes are ecv and lvm changes measured by cmri after 6 months of treatment.ethics and dissemination the study design is approved by the ethical committee of beijing hospital (2022bjyyec-070-02). the trial is registered at the chinese clinical trial registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn). the trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.trial registration number chinese clinical trial registry (chictr2200060862).",AB_0393
"background: this study aimed to analyze the long-term prognostic factors in acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion (vbao) patients treated with endovascular treatment (evt). methods: this study was performed using the acute posterior circulation ischemic stroke registry database from 21 stroke centers in 18 cities in china and retrospectively included consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with an acute, symptomatic, radiologically confirmed vbao who were treated with evt between december 2015 and december 2018. favorable clinical outcomes were evaluated by machine-learning methods. a clinical signature was constructed in the training cohort using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and was validated in the validation cohort.results: from 28 potential factors, 7 variables were independent prognostic factors and were included in the model: modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (m) [odds ratio (or): 2.900; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.566-5.370], age (a) (or, 0.977; 95% ci: 0.961-0.993), national institutes of health stroke scale (n) (13-27 vs. =12: or, 0.491; 95% ci: 0.275-0.876; = 28 vs. =12: or, 0.148; 95% ci: 0.076-0.289), atrial fibrillation (a) (or, 2.383; 95% ci: 1.444-3.933), glasgow coma scale (g) (or, 2.339; 95% ci: 1.383-3.957), endovascular stent-retriever thrombectomy (e) (stent-retriever vs. aspiration: or, 0.375; 95% ci: 0.156-0.902), and estimated time of onset of the occlusion to groin puncture (time) (or, 0.950; 95% ci: 0.909-0.993) (abbreviated as manage time). in the internal validation set, this model was well calibrated with good discrimination [c-index (95% ci) = 0.790 (0.755-0.826)]. a calculator based on the model can be found online (http://odywong.shinyapps.io/1yearfco/).conclusion: our results indicate that optimizing for evt, along with specific risk stratification, may improve long-term prognosis. however, a larger prospective study is needed to confirm the findings.",AB_0393
"objectives: ustekinumab (ust) optimization strategies, including shortening intervals and intravenous reinduction, should be administered to patients with partial or loss of respond. evidence comparing these types of optimization treatments is limited. we evaluated the efficacy and safety of weight-based ust intravenous reinduction in patients with refractory crohn's disease (cd). methods: this was a single-center retrospective observational study. optimization strategies were designed for patients showing partial or loss of response to standardized ust therapy. clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic response and remission rate were determined by crohn's disease activity index (cdai), c-reactive protein (crp) levels, and ses-cd evaluation. ust trough concentrations were detected and adverse events were recorded. results: a total of 128 patients receiving ust optimization therapies were included, with 105 patients administered shortening intervals of q8w or q4w, and 23 receiving intravenous reinduction followed by subcutaneous q8w or q4w. the follow-up duration for the shortening interval and reinduction cohorts were 15.0 (10.0, 31.0) and 23.0 (13.0, 70.0) weeks, respectively. a significant cdai delta variation pre-and post-treatment could be found between groups [17.0 (-4.4, 65.9) vs. 69.0(10.7, 151.0), p = 0.013]. the trough concentration of ust increased [2.5 (1.3, 5.3) vs. 1.1 (0.5, 2.3), p = 0.001] after intravenous reinduction. clinical and endoscopic remission were achieved in 69.6 and 31.8% of patients in the intravenous reinduction cohort, and 62.9 and 22.2% of patients in the shortening interval cohort, respectively. no significant difference was found between groups regarding safety. conclusion: intravenous reinduction brought about favorable recapture of clinical and endoscopic remission, and should have significant priority over the strategy of merely shortening drug intervals, which should be launched before switching to other biologics targeting different inflammatory pathways. clinical trial registration: identifier nct04923100. https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/nct04923100?id=04923100&draw=2&rank=",AB_0393
"congenital heart disease (chd) is one of the most common causes of major birth defects, with a prevalence of 1%. although an increasing number of studies have reported the etiology of chd, the findings scattered throughout the literature are difficult to retrieve and utilize in research and clinical practice. we therefore developed chdbase, an evidence-based knowledgebase of chd-related genes and clinical manifestations manually curated from 1114 publications, linking 1124 susceptibility genes and 3591 variations to more than 300 chd types and related syndromes. metadata such as the information of each publication and the selected population and samples, the strategy of studies, and the major findings of studies were integrated with each item of the research record. we also integrated functional annotations through parsing -50 databases/tools to facilitate the interpretation of these genes and variations in disease pathogenicity. we further prioritized the significance of these chd-related genes with a gene interaction network approach and extracted a core chd sub-network with 163 genes. the clear genetic landscape of chd enables the phenotype classification based on the shared genetic origin. overall, chdbase provides a comprehensive and freely available resource to study chd susceptibilities, supporting a wide range of users in the sci-entific and medical communities. chdbase is accessible at http://chddb.fwgenetics.org.",AB_0393
"the purpose of this work is to enhance kinasephos, a machine learning-based kinasespecific phosphorylation site prediction tool. experimentally verified kinase-specific phosphorylation data were collected from phosphositeplus, uniprotkb, the gps 5.0, and phospho.elm. in total, 41,421 experimentally verified kinase-specific phosphorylation sites were identified. a total of 1380 unique kinases were identified, including 753 with existing classification information from kinbase and the remaining 627 annotated by building a phylogenetic tree. based on this kinase classification, a total of 771 predictive models were built at the individual, family, and group levels, using at least 15 experimentally verified substrate sites in positive training datasets. the improved models demonstrated their effectiveness compared with other prediction tools. for example, the prediction of sites phosphorylated by the protein kinase b, casein kinase 2, and protein kinase a families had accuracies of 94.5%, 92.5%, and 90.0%, respectively. the average prediction accuracy for all 771 models was 87.2%. for enhancing interpretability, the shapley additive explanations (shap) method was employed to assess feature importance. the web interface of kinasephos 3.0 has been redesigned to provide comprehensive annotations of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on multiple proteins. additionally, considering the large scale of phosphoproteomic data, a downloadable prediction tool is available at https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/kinasephos/download.html or https://github.com/tom-209/ kinasephos-3.0-executable-file.",AB_0393
"introduction: n4-acetylcytidine (ac4c) is a critical acetylation modification that has an essential function in protein translation and is associated with a number of human diseases. methods: the process of identifying ac4c sites by biological experiments is too cumbersome and costly. and the performance of several existing computational models needs to be improved. therefore, we propose a new deep learning tool emdl-ac4c to predict ac4c sites, which uses a simple one-hot encoding for a unbalanced dataset using a downsampled ensemble deep learning network to extract important features to identify ac4c sites. the base learner of this ensemble model consists of a modified densenet and squeeze-and-excitation networks. in addition, we innovatively add a convolutional residual structure in parallel with the dense block to achieve the effect of two-layer feature extraction. results: the average accuracy (acc), mathews correlation coefficient (mcc), and area under the curve area under curve of emdl-ac4c on ten independent testing sets are 80.84%, 61.77%, and 87.94%, respectively. discussion: multiple experimental comparisons indicate that emdl-ac4c outperforms existing predictors and it greatly improved the predictive performance of the ac4c sites. at the same time, emdl-ac4c could provide a valuable reference for the next part of the study. the source code and experimental data are available at: https://github.com/13133989982/emdlac4c.",AB_0393
"linkage disequilibrium (ld) analysis is fundamental to the investigation of the genetic architecture of complex traits (e.g. human disease, animal and plant breeding) and population structure and evolution dynamics. however, until now, studies primarily focus on ld status between genetic variants located on the same chromosome. moreover, genome (re)sequencing produces unprecedented numbers of genetic variants, and fast ld computation becomes a challenge. here, we have developed gwld, a parallelized and generalized tool designed for the rapid genome-wide calculation of ld values, including conventional d/d', r(2), and (reduced) mutual information (mi and rmi) measures. ld between genetic variants within and across chromosomes can be rapidly computed and visualized in either an r package or a standalone c++ software package. to evaluate the accuracy and speed of ld calculation, we conducted comparisons using 4 real datasets. interchromosomal ld patterns observed potentially reflect levels of selection intensity across different species. both versions of gwld, the r package (https://github.com/rong-zh/gwld/gwld-r) and the standalone c++ software (https:// github.com/rong-zh/gwld/gwld-c++), are freely available on github.",AB_0393
"background the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and subsequent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has resulted in a significant global public health burden, leading to an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies. monoclonal antibodies (mabs) are a potentially effective therapeutic option. we identified a potent antibody jmb2002 against the sars-cov-2 receptor binding domain. jmb2002 has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a sars-cov-2 infected rhesus macaque model. methods we conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 1 trial to evaluate the jmb2002's safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity in healthy chinese adults. participants were randomly assigned to one of four cohorts with sequential dose, administrated intravenously with jmb2002 or placebo, and followed up for 85 +/- 5 days. results 40 participants were recruited and completed in the study. eight (25.0%) participants experienced 13 treatment emergent adverse events ( teaes) that were drug-related. no serious adverse events (saes), dose limiting events (dlts), or adverse events of special interest (aesis), such as infusion related/allergic reactions, were observed, and no drop out due to adverse events (aes) occurred. there was no significant safety difference observed between jmb2002 and the placebo, suggesting it was well tolerated. the auc(0-infinity), auc(0-t) of jmb2002 infusion increased dose-dependently from 5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg while there is also a linear trend between doses and c-max. conclusion therefore, jmb2002 was well tolerated after administration of a single dose in the range of 5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg in healthy chinese adults. trial registration chictr2100042150 at https://www.chictr.org.cn/searchproj.aspx (14/01/2021).",AB_0393
"background youtube (tm) (http://www.youtube.com), as a very popular video site worldwide, is increasingly being used as a platform to disseminate health information. the purposes of this review were to assess the overall usefulness of the information on the prevention of valproic acid use in women during pregnancy on youtube (tm) for patients. methods the youtube (tm) website was systematically using 8 keywords. one hundred and fifty four videos meet the selection criteria. the researcher evaluated the video duration, days since upload, views and the likes. these videos are categorized as education, news & politics and people & blogs. we designed a usefulness scoring scheme to assess videos quality and classified them as slightly useful, useful and very useful. the kruskal-wallis test was used to determine whether differences existed between total usefulness scores and categories and pearson chi-square test for categorical variables. results the majority of videos were educational (62.8%). the people & blogs and news & politics videos scored significantly higher, but had no significant difference in days since upload, views, views/day or likes. more than half of the videos (91/154) were categorized as useful. the mean posted days (p = 0.045) was significantly different in the useful group compared with the slightly useful group. there were no correlation between usefulness and the number of days since upload, duration, views, views/day, or likes. conclusion youtube (tm) is a promising source of information regarding the use of valproic acid during pregnancy. news & politics videos are the most usefulness. considering the presence of more slightly useful information, publishers need to improve more comprehensive video content that includes replacement medications, diagnoses and treatments. in the healthcare information space, consumers need to be directed to reliable video.",AB_0393
"humans do not learn everything from the scratch but can connect and associate the upcoming information with the exchanged experience and known knowledge. such an idea can be extended to cooperated multi-reinforcement learning and has achieved its success on homogeneous agents by means of parameter sharing. however, it is difficult to straightforwardly apply parameter sharing when dealing with heterogeneous agents thanks to their individual forms of input/output and their diverse functions and targets. neuroscience has provided evidence that our brain creates several levels of experience and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that not only exchange similar experiences but also allow for sharing of abstract concepts to handle unfamiliar situations that others have already encountered. inspired by such a brain's functions, we propose a semi-independent training policy method that can well tackle the conflict between parameter sharing and specialized training for heterogeneous agents. it employs a shared common representation for both observation and action, enabling the integration of various input and output sources. additionally, a shared latent space is utilized to maintain a balanced relationship between the upstream policy and downstream functions, benefiting each individual agent's target. from the experiments, it can approve that our proposed method outperforms the current mainstream algorithms, especially when handling heterogeneous agents. empirically, our proposed method can also be improved as a more general and fundamental heterogeneous agents' reinforcement learning structure for curriculum learning and representation transfer. all our code is open and released on https://gitlab.com/reinforcement/ntype.",AB_0393
