"code review is a software development practice aimed at assessing code quality, finding defects, and sharing knowledge among developers. despite its wide adoption, code review is a challenging task for developers, who often struggle to understand the content of a review change-set. visualization techniques represent a promising approach to support reviewers. in this paper we present a new visualization approach that displays classes and methods in review changes as nodes in a graph. then, we implemented our graph-based approach in a tool (reviewvis) and performed a two-step feedback collection phase to assess the developers' perceptions on the tool's benefits through (1) an in-company study with nine professional software developers and (2) an online survey with 37 participants. given the positive results obtained by this first evaluation, we performed a second survey with 31 participants with a specific focus on supporting developers' understanding of a review change-set. the collected feedback showed that the developers indeed perceive that reviewvis can help them navigate and understand the changes under review. the results achieved also indicate possible future paths to use software visualization for code review. data and materials: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7047993 (c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier inc. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0010
"compared with conventional comparative genomics, the recent studies in pan-genomics have provided further insights into species genomic dynamics, taxonomy and identification, pathogenicity and environmental adaptation. to better understand genome characteristics of species of interest and to fully excavate key metabolic and resistant genes and their conservations and variations, here we present propan (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/propan), a public database covering 23 archaeal species and 1,481 bacterial species (in a total of 51,882 strains) for comprehensively profiling prokaryotic pan-genome dynamics. by analyzing and integrating these massive datasets. propan offers three major aspects for the pan-genome dynamics of the species of interest: 1) the evaluations of various species' characteristics and composition in pan-genome dynamics; 2) the visualization of map association, the functional annotation and presence/absence variation for all contained species' gene clusters; 3) the typical characteristics of the environmental adaptation, including resistance genes prediction of 126 substances (biocide, antimicrobial drug and metal) and evaluation of 31 metabolic cycle processes. besides, propan develops a very user-friendly interface, flexible retrieval and multi-level real-time statistical visualization. taken together, propan will serve as a weighty resource for the studies of prokaryotic pan-genome dynamics, taxonomy and identification as well as environmental adaptation.",AB_0010
"enzyme parameters are essential for quantitatively understanding, modelling, and engineering cells. however, experimental measurements cover only a small fraction of known enzyme-compound pairs in model organisms, much less in other organisms. artificial intelligence (al) techniques have accelerated the pace of exploring enzyme properties by predicting these in a high-throughput manner. here, we present gotenzymes, an extensive database with enzyme parameter predictions by al approaches, which is publicly available at https://metabolicatlas.org/gotenzymes for interactive web exploration and programmatic access. the first release of this data resource contains predicted turnover numbers of over 25.7 million enzyme-compound pairs across 8099 organisms. we believe that gotenzymes, with the readily-predicted enzyme parameters, would bring a speed boost to biological research covering both experimental and computational fields that involve working with candidate enzymes.",AB_0010
"snodb is an interactive database of human small nucleolar rnas (snornas) that includes up-to-date information on snorna features, genomic location, conservation, host gene, snorna-rna targets and snorna abundance and provides links to other resources. in the second edition of this database (snodb 2.0), we added an entirely new section on ribosomal rna (rrna) chemical modifications guided by snornas with easy navigation between the different rrna versions used in the literature and experimentally measured levels of modification. we also included new layers of information, including snorna motifs, secondary structure prediction, snorna-protein interactions, copy annotations and low structure bias expression data in a wide panel of tissues and cell lines to bolster functional probing of snorna biology. version 2.0 features updated identifiers, more links to external resources and duplicate entry resolution. as a result, snodb 2.0, which is freely available at https://bioinfoscottgroup.med.usherbrooke.ca/snodb/, represents a one-stop shop for snorna features, rrna modification targets, functional impact and potential regulators.",AB_0010
"recent advances in single image super-resolution (sisr) explore the power of deep convolutional neu-ral networks (cnns) to achieve better performance. however, most of the progress has been made by scaling cnn architectures, which usually raise computational demands and memory consumption. this makes modern architectures less applicable in practice. in addition, most cnn-based sr methods do not fully utilize the informative hierarchical features that are helpful for final image recovery. in order to address these issues, we propose a directional variance attention network (divanet), a computationally efficient yet accurate network for sisr. specifically, we introduce a novel directional variance attention (diva) mechanism to capture long-range spatial dependencies and exploit inter-channel dependencies si-multaneously for more discriminative representations. furthermore, we propose a residual attention fea-ture group (rafg) for parallelizing attention and residual block computation. the output of each residual block is linearly fused at the rafg output to provide access to the whole feature hierarchy. in parallel, diva extracts most relevant features from the network for improving the final output and preventing information loss along the successive operations inside the network. experimental results demonstrate the superiority of divanet over the state of the art in several datasets, while maintaining relatively low computation and memory footprint. the code is available at https://github.com/pbehjatii/divanet .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0010
"state-of-the-art noisy-label learning algorithms rely on an unsupervised learning to classify training sam-ples as clean or noisy, followed by a semi-supervised learning (ssl) that minimises the empirical vicinal risk using a labelled set formed by samples classified as clean, and an unlabelled set with samples clas-sified as noisy. the classification accuracy of such noisy-label learning methods depends on the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples, and the robustness of ssl to small clean sets. we address these points with a new noisy-label training algorithm, called longremix, which im-proves the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples and the robustness of ssl to small clean sets with a two-stage learning process. the stage one of longremix finds a small but precise high-confidence clean set, and stage two augments this high-confidence clean set with new clean samples and oversamples the clean data to increase the robustness of ssl to small clean sets. we test longremix on cifar-10 and cifar-10 0 with introduced synthetic noisy labels, and the real-world noisy -label benchmarks cnwl (red mini-imagenet), webvision, clothing1m, and food101-n. the results show that our longremix produces significantly better classification accuracy than competing approaches, par-ticularly in high noise rate problems. furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in most datasets. the code is available at https://github.com/filipe-research/longremix .(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0010
"we present a computational and theoretical framework for solving the schrodinger equation (se) for the two-center coulomb problem in prolate spheroidal coordinates when the energy of the se is positive. a general and robust computer code has been produced that calculates the separation constants, spheroidal harmonic expansion coefficients, regular quasi-radial two-center coulomb wave functions, and two- center coulomb phase shifts. these quantities can be calculated over a range of internuclear separations, angular momentum projections, and continuum electron momenta. a representative set of results are presented and compared with previous calculations, excellent agreement is found in many cases while significant disagreements are found in others. program summary program title: spheroidal-cw cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /nf5gw7vjnh .1 code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /7638744 licensing provisions: mit programming language: fortran 90 nature of problem: a robust and accurate computer code for calculating coulomb wave functions in prolate spheroidal coordinate is necessary for the calculation of cross sections for photonionization, and electron and positron scattering on charged diatomic targets. solution method: the angular solution is expanded in a series of spherical harmonics leading to the diagonalization of a pentadiagonal matrix. the eigenvectors contain the expansion coefficients and the eigenvalues are the separation constants which, unlike the se in spherical coordinates, are also functions of the energy. the radial two-center coulomb wave functions are started using a power series solution and then propagated using a linear multistep method. an asymptotic expansion is used to calculate the two-center coulomb phase shift, and to normalize the radial wave function. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: two-center coulomb radial wave functions and phase shifts can be accurately calculated for internuclear separations from 0.001 to 60.0 a0, angular momentum projection |m| from 0 to 44, momentum k from 0.01 to 100.0 a.u., and a combined nuclear charge z(+ )from 1 to 12.

"r-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed from the hybridization of rna and dna. in 2012, ginno et al. introduced the first r-loop mapping method. since that time, dozens of r-loop mapping studies have been conducted, yielding hundreds of publicly available datasets. current ir-loop databases provide only limited access to these data. moreover, no web tools for analyzing user-supplied r-loop datasets have yet been described. in our recent work, we reprocessed 810 r-loop mapping samples, building the largest r-loop data resource to date. we also defined r-loop consensus regions and developed a framework for r-loop data analysis. now, we introduce rlbase, a user-friendly database that provides the capability to (i) explore hundreds of public r-loop mapping datasets, (ii) explore r-loop consensus regions, (iii) analyze user-supplied data and (iv) download standardized and reprocessed datasets. rlbase is directly accessible via the following url: https://gccri.bishop-lab. uthscsa.edu/shiny/rlbase/.",AB_0010
"heterogeneous graph representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional vector representations of different types of entities and relations to empower downstream tasks. existing popular methods either capture semantic relationships but indirectly leverage node/edge attributes in a complex way, or leverage node/edge attributes directly without taking semantic relationships into account. when involving multi-ple convolution operations, they also have poor scalability. to overcome these limitations, this paper pro-poses a flexible and efficient graph information propagation network (gripnet) framework. specifically, we introduce a new supergraph data structure consisting of supervertices and superedges. a supervertex is a semantically-coherent subgraph. a superedge defines an information propagation path between two supervertices. gripnet learns new representations for the supervertex of interest by propagating informa-tion along the defined path using multiple layers. we construct multiple large-scale graphs and evaluate gripnet against competing methods to show its superiority in link prediction, node classification, and data integration. the code and data are available at https://github.com/nyxflower/gripnet .(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license (  )",AB_0010
"hyperspectral band selection aims to identify an optimal subset of bands for hyperspectral images (hsis). for most existing clustering-based band selection methods, they directly stretch each band into a single feature vector and employ the pixelwise features to address band redundancy. in this way, they do not take full consideration of the spatial information and deal with the importance of different regions in hsis, which leads to a nonoptimal selection. to address these issues, a region-aware hierarchical latent feature representation learning-guided clustering (hlfc) method is proposed. specifically, in order to fully preserve the spatial information of hsis, the superpixel segmentation algorithm is adopted to segment hsis into multiple regions first. for each segmented region, the similarity graph is constructed to reflect the bands-wise similarity, and its corresponding laplacian matrix is generated for learning low-dimensional latent features in a hierarchical way. all latent features are then fused to form a unified feature representation of hsis. finally, k-means clustering is utilized on the unified feature representation matrix to generate multiple clusters from which the band with maximum information entropy is selected to form the final subset of bands. extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed clustering method can achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art representative methods on the band selection. the demo code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/wangjun2023/hlfc.",AB_0010
