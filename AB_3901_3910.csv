"immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment method; however, only a few patients benefit from it. the development of new immunotherapy strategies and effective biomarkers of response and resistance is urgently needed. recently, high-throughput bulk and single-cell gene expression profiling technologies have generated valuable resources. however, these resources are not well organized and systematic analysis is difficult. here, we present tiger, a tumor immunotherapy gene expression resource, which contains bulk transcriptome data of 1508 tumor samples with clinical immunotherapy outcomes and 11,057 tumor/normal samples without clinical immunotherapy outcomes, as well as single-cell transcriptome data of 2,116,945 immune cells from 655 samples. tiger provides many useful modules for analyzing collected and user-provided data. using the resource in tiger, we identified a tumor-enriched subset of cd4+ t cells. patients with melanoma with a higher signature score of this subset have a significantly better response and survival under immunotherapy. we believe that tiger will be helpful in understanding anti-tumor immunity mechanisms and discovering effective biomarkers. tiger is freely accessible at http:// tiger.canceromics.org/.",AB_0391
"next-generation sequencing technologies both boost the discovery of variants in the human genome and exacerbate the challenges of pathogenic variant identification. in this study, we developed pathogenicity prediction tool for missense variants (mvppt), a highly sensitive and accurate missense variant classifier based on gradient boosting. mvppt adopts high-confidence training sets with a wide spectrum of variant profiles, and extracts three categories of features, including scores from existing prediction tools, frequencies (allele frequencies, amino acid frequencies, and genotype frequencies), and genomic context. compared with established predictors, mvppt achieves superior performance in all test sets, regardless of data source. in addition, our study also provides guidance for training set and feature selection strategies, as well as reveals highly relevant features, which may further provide biological insights into variant pathogenicity. mvppt is freely available at http://www.mvppt.club/.",AB_0391
"genetic and epigenetic changes after polyploidization events could result in variable gene expression and modified regulatory networks. here, using large-scale transcriptome data, we constructed co-expression networks for diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat species, and built a platform for comparing co-expression networks of allohexaploid wheat and its progenitors, named wheatcenet. wheatcenet is a platform for searching and comparing specific functional coexpression networks, as well as identifying the related functions of the genes clustered therein. functional annotations like pathways, gene families, protein-protein interactions, micrornas (mirnas), and several lines of epigenome data are integrated into this platform, and gene ontology (go) annotation, gene set enrichment analysis (gsea), motif identification, and other useful tools are also included. using wheatcenet, we found that the network of wheat aberrant panicle organization 1 (wapo1) has more co-expressed genes related to spike development in hexaploid wheat than its progenitors. we also found a novel motif of ccwwwwwwgg (carg) specifically in the promoter region of wapo-a1, suggesting that neofunctionalization of the wapo-a1 gene affects spikelet development in hexaploid wheat. wheatcenet is useful for investigating co-expression networks and conducting other analyses, and thus facilitates comparative and functional genomic studies in wheat. wheatcenet is freely available at http:// bioinformatics.cpolar.cn/wheatcenet and http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/wheatcenet.",AB_0391
"single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) is revolutionizing the study of complex and dynamic cellular mechanisms. however, cell type annotation remains a main challenge as it largely relies on a priori knowledge and manual curation, which is cumbersome and subjective. the increasing number of scrna-seq datasets, as well as numerous published genetic studies, has motivated us to build a comprehensive human cell type reference atlas. here, we present decoding cell type specificity (decs), an automatic cell type annotation method augmented by a comprehensive collection of human cell type expression profiles and marker genes. we used decs to annotate scrnaseq data from various tissue types and systematically evaluated the annotation accuracy under different conditions, including reference panels, sequencing depth, and feature selection strategies. our results demonstrate that expanding the references is critical for improving annotation accuracy. compared to many existing state-of-the-art annotation tools, decs significantly reduced computation time and increased accuracy. decs can be integrated into the standard scrna-seq analytical pipeline to enhance cell type annotation. finally, we demonstrated the broad utility of decs to identify trait-cell type associations in 51 human complex traits, providing deep insights into the cel-lular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. all documents for decs, including source code, user manual, demo data, and tutorials, are freely available at https://github.com/bsml320/decs.",AB_0391
"non-coding genomic variants constitute the majority of trait-associated genome variations; however, the identification of functional non-coding variants is still a challenge in human genetics, and a method for systematically assessing the impact of regulatory variants on gene expression and linking these regulatory variants to potential target genes is still lacking. here, we introduce a deep neural network (dnn)-based computational framework, regvar, which can accurately predict the tissue-specific impact of non-coding regulatory variants on target genes. we show that by robustly learning the genomic characteristics of massive variant-gene expression associations in a variety of human tissues, regvar vastly surpasses all current non-coding variant prioritization methods in predicting regulatory variants under different circumstances. the unique features of regvar make it an excellent framework for assessing the regulatory impact of any variant on its putative target genes in a variety of tissues. regvar is available as a web server at https://regvar.omic.tech/.",AB_0391
"allergy is an autoimmune disorder described as an undesirable response of the immune system to typically innocuous substance in the environment. studies have shown that the ability of proteins to trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals can be evaluated by bioinformatics tools. however, developing computational methods to accurately identify new allergenic proteins remains a vital challenge. this work aims to propose a machine learning model based on multi-feature fusion for predicting allergenic proteins efficiently. firstly, we prepared a benchmark dataset of allergenic and non-allergenic protein sequences and pretested on it with a machine-learning platform. then, three preferable feature extraction methods, including amino acid composition (aac), dipeptide composition (dpc) and composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (cksaap) were chosen to extract protein sequence features. subsequently, these features were fused and optimized by pearson correlation coefficient (pcc) and principal component analysis (pca). finally, the most representative features were picked out to build the optimal predictor based on random forest (rf) algorithm. performance evaluation results via 5-fold cross-validation showed that the final model, called ialler (https://github.com/laihongyan/ialler), could precisely distinguish allergenic proteins from non-allergenic proteins. the prediction accuracy and auc value for validation dataset achieved 91.4% and 0.97%, respectively. this model will provide guide for users to identify more allergenic proteins.",AB_0391
"motivation: family-based study design is one of the popular designs used in genetic research, and the whole-genome sequencing data obtained from family-based studies offer many unique features for risk prediction studies. they can not only provide a more comprehensive view of many complex diseases, but also utilize information in the design to further improve the prediction accuracy. while promising, existing analytical methods often ignore the information embedded in the study design and overlook the predictive effects of rare variants, leading to a prediction model with sub-optimal performance.results: we proposed a bayesian linear mixed model for the prediction analysis of sequencing data obtained from family-based studies. our method can not only capture predictive effects from both common and rare variants, but also easily accommodate various disease model assumptions. it uses information embedded in the study design to form surrogates, where the predictive effects from unmeasured/unknown genetic and environmental risk factors can be modelled. through extensive simulation studies and the analysis of sequencing data obtained from the michigan state university twin registry study, we have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms commonly adopted techniques.availability: r package is available at https://github.com/yhai943/fblmm.",AB_0391
"the bnl and fnal measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon disagree with the standard model (sm) prediction by more than 4 sigma. the hadronic vacuum polarization (hvp) contributions are the dominant source of uncertainty in the sm prediction. there are, however, tensions between different estimates of the hvp contributions, including data-driven estimates based on measurements of the r-ratio. to investigate that tension, we modeled the unknown r-ratio as a function of cm energy with a treed gaussian process (tgp). this is a principled and general method grounded in data-science that allows complete uncertainty quantification and automatically balances over- and under-fitting to noisy data. our tool yields exploratory results are similar to previous ones and we find no indication that the r-ratio was previously mismodeled. whilst we advance some aspects of modeling the r-ratio and develop new tools for doing so, a competitive estimate of the hvp contributions requires domain-specific expertise and a carefully curated database of measurements (github, https://github.com/qiao688/tgp_for_g-2).",AB_0391
"using a set of high-resolution n-body simulations, we extend the unified distribution model of cold dark matter (cdm) subhaloes to the warm dark matter (wdm) case. the same model framework combining the unevolved mass function, unevolved radial distribution, and tidal stripping can predict the mass function and spatial distribution of subhaloes in both cdm and wdm simulations. the dependence of the model on the dm particle property is universally parametrized through the half-mode mass of the initial power spectrum. compared with the cdm model, the wdm model differs most notably in two aspects. (1) in contrast to the power-law form in cdm, the unevolved subhalo mass function for wdm is scale-dependent at the low mass end due to the cut-off in the initial power spectrum. (2) wdm subhaloes are more vulnerable to tidal stripping and disruption due to their lower concentrations at accretion time. their survival rate is also found to depend on the infall mass. accounting for these differences, the model predicts a final wdm subhalo mass function that is also proportional to the unevolved subhalo mass function. the radial distribution of wdm subhaloes is predicted to be mass-dependent. for low mass subhaloes, the radial distribution is flatter in the inner halo and steeper in the outer halo compared to the cdm counterpart, due to the scale-dependent unevolved mass function and the enhanced tidal stripping. the code for sampling subhaloes according to our generalized model is available at https://github.com/fhtouma/subgen2.",AB_0391
"backgroundpulmonary tuberculosis is a major public health problem endangering people's health, a scientifically accurate predictive model is of great practical significance for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.methodsthe reported incidence data of pulmonary tuberculosis were from the national public health science data center (https://www.phsciencedata.cn/). the arima, lstm, emd-sarima, emd-lstm, emd-arma-lstm models were established using the reported monthly incidence of tuberculosis reported in china from january 2008 to december 2018. the mse, mae, rmse and mape were used to evaluate the performance of the models to determine the best model.resultscomparing decomposition-based single model with undecomposed single model, it was found that: when predicting the incidence trend in the next year, compared with sarima model, the mse, mae, rmse and mape of emd-sarima decreased by 39.3%, 19.0%, 22.1% and 19.8%, respectively. the mse, mae, rmse and mape of emd-lstm were reduced by 40.5%, 12.8%, 22.9% and 12.7%, respectively, compared with the lstm model; comparing the decomposition-based hybrid model with the decomposition-based single model, it was found that: when predicting the incidence trend in the next year, compared with emd-sarima model, the mse, mae, rmse and mape of emd-arma-lstm model decreased by 21.7%, 10.6%, 11.5% and 11.2%, respectively. the mse, mae, rmse and mape of emd-arma-lstm were reduced by 16.7%, 9.6%, 8.7% and 12.3%, respectively, compared with emd-lstm model. furthermore, the performance of the model were consistent when predicting the incidence trend in the next 3 months, 6 months and 9 months.conclusionthe prediction performance of the decomposition-based single model is better than that of the undecomposed single model, and the prediction performance of the combined model using the advantages of different models is better than that of the decomposition-based single model, so the emd-arma-lstm combination model can improve the prediction accuracy better than other models, which can provide a theoretical basis for predicting the epidemic trend of pulmonary tuberculosis and formulating prevention and control policies.",AB_0391
