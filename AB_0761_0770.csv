"backgroundself-harm in young people is a public health concern connected with severe mental health problems, such as personality pathology. currently, there are no specific evidence-based interventions available for young people who self-harm. therefore, we developed pre-intervention monitoring of affect and relationships in youth (primary), a smartphone-based intervention, co-designed by clinicians and young people with lived experience of mental ill-health. primary combines the experience sampling method (esm) with weekly report sessions. the study aims to examine the effectiveness of primary with regard to reducing self-harm, and improving emotion regulation and quality of relationships.methodsthis study is a multicenter, parallel groups, randomized controlled trial (rct) comparing the primary intervention to a waiting list control group. primary comprises 28 consecutive days of questionnaires five times each day (i.e., esm) and four weekly report sessions. participants will comprise 180 young people referred for treatment to the participating dutch mental healthcare institutions and (1) are aged 12 to 25 years, and (2) engaged in >= 1 act of self-harm in the past year. participants are randomly allocated to a study group after screening in a 1:1 ratio by an independent researcher using computer-generated randomization sequences with stratified block randomization by age (12 to 15 years / 16 to 25 years). staff will conduct assessments with all participants at baseline (wave 1), after 28 days (wave 2), and in a subsample after 10 weeks of subsequent specialized treatment (wave 3). the primary outcomes are self-harm, emotion regulation, and quality of relationships. secondary outcomes include patient and clinician satisfaction. exploratory analyses of esm data will examine the relationship between emotions, social relationships, and self-harm.discussionthe results of this trial will clarify whether an innovative smartphone-based intervention is effective for reducing self harm and improving emotion regulation and the quality of social relationships. it has the potential to fill a treatment gap of interventions specifically targeting self-harm. if proven effective, it would provide an accessible, easy-to-implement, low-cost intervention for young people. furthermore, the esm-data will allow detailed analyses into the processes underlying self-harm, which will contribute to theoretical knowledge regarding the behavior.trial registrationisrctn42088538 (https://doi.org/10.1186/isrctn42088538), retrospectively registered on the 26th of october 2022.",AB_0077
"background:although venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ecmo) is beneficial for the treatment of profound cardiogenic shock, peripheral va-ecmo cannulation can increase left ventricular afterload, thus compromising myocardial recovery. we investigated whether early routine left ventricular unloading can reduce 30-day mortality compared with the conventional approach in patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing va-ecmo.methods:this randomized clinical trial involved 116 patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing va-ecmo from march 2021 to september 2022 at chonnam national university hospital, gwangju, south korea. the patients were randomly assigned to undergo either early routine left ventricular unloading with transseptal left atrial cannulation within 12 hours after randomization (n=58) or the conventional approach, which permitted rescue transseptal left atrial cannulation in case of an increased left ventricular afterload (n=58). the primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days.results:all 116 randomized patients (mean age, 67.6 +/- 13.5 years; 34 [29.3%] women) completed the trial. at 30 days, all-cause death had occurred in 27 (46.6%) patients in the early group and 26 (44.8%) patients in the conventional group (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% ci, 0.59-1.74]; p=0.942). crossover to rescue transseptal left atrial cannulation occurred in 29 patients (50%) in the conventional group according to a clear indication. time to rescue transseptal cannulation in the conventional group was a median of 21.8 (interquartile range, 12.4-52.2) hours after randomization. there were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes between the 2 groups except for a shorter time to disappearance of pulmonary congestion in the early group (median, 3 [interquartile range, 2-6] versus 5 [interquartile range, 3-7] days; p=0.027).conclusions:among patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing va-ecmo, early routine left ventricular unloading with transseptal left atrial cannulation did not reduce 30-day mortality compared with the conventional strategy, which permitted rescue transseptal left atrial cannulation. these findings should be cautiously interpreted until the results of multicenter trials using other unloading modalities become available.registration:url: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: nct04775472.",AB_0077
"backgroundaustralia persistently has one of the highest rates of colorectal cancer (crc) in the world. australia's national bowel cancer screening program (nbcsp) sends a biennial faecal immunochemical test (fit)-the 'nbcsp kit'-to everyone eligible for the programme between 50 and 74 years old; however, participation in the programme is low, especially in the 50- to 60-year-old age group. our previous efficacy trial ('smartscreen') demonstrated an absolute increase in uptake of 16.5% (95% confidence interval = 2.02-30.9%) for people sent an sms with motivational and instructional videos, from their general practice prior to receiving their nbcsp kit, compared to those receiving usual care. building on the strengths of the smartscreen trial and addressing limitations, the 'smarterscreen' trial will test the effect on participation in the nbcsp of sending either an sms only or an sms with online video material to general practice patients due to receive their nbcsp compared to 'usual care'.methodssmarterscreen is a three-arm stratified cluster randomised controlled trial involving 63 general practices in two states in australia. eligible patients are patients who are aged 49-60 years and due to receive their nbcsp kit within the next 2 weeks during the intervention period. general practices will be equally randomised to three trial arms (21:21:21, estimated average 260 patients/practice). the two interventions include (i) an sms with an encouraging message from their general practice or (ii) the same sms with weblinks to additional motivational and instructional videos. the control arm will receive 'usual care'. using the intention-to-treat approach, primary analysis will estimate the three pair-wise between-arm differences in the proportion of eligible patients who participate in the nbcsp within 6 months of when their kit is sent, utilising screening data from the australian national cancer screening register (ncsr). patient intervention adherence to the interventions will also be evaluated. findings will be incorporated into the policy1-bowel microsimulation model to estimate the long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.discussionsmarterscreen will provide high-level evidence determining whether an sms or an sms with web-based material sent to general practice patients prior to receiving their nbcsp kit increases participation in bowel cancer screening.trial registrationaustralian new zealand clinical trials registry actrn12623000036617. registered on 13 january 2023.trial url: https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=385119&isclinicaltrial=falsetrial registrationaustralian new zealand clinical trials registry actrn12623000036617. registered on 13 january 2023.trial url: https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=385119&isclinicaltrial=false",AB_0077
"lymphedema is a disease that refers to tissue swelling caused by an accumulation of protein-rich fluid that is usually drained through the lymphatic system. detection of lymphedema is often based on expensive diagnoses such as bioimpedance spectroscopy, shear wave elastography, computed tomography, etc. in current machine learning models for lymphedema prediction, reliance on observable symptoms reported by patients introduces the possibility of errors in patient-input data. moreover, these symptoms are often absent during the initial stages of lymphedema, creating challenges in its early detection. identifying lymphedema before these observable symptoms manifest would greatly benefit patients by potentially minimizing the discomfort caused by these symptoms. in this study, we propose to use new data, such as complete blood count, serum, and therapy data, to develop predictive models for lymphedema. this approach aims to compensate for the limitations of using only observable symptoms data. we collected data from 2137 patients, including 356 patients with lymphedema and 1781 patients without lymphedema, with the lymphedema status of each patient confirmed by clinicians. the data for each patient included: (1) a complete blood count (cbc) test, (2) a serum test, and (3) therapy information. we used various machine learning algorithms (i.e. random forest, gradient boosting, decision tree, logistic regression, and artificial neural network) to develop predictive models on the training dataset (i.e. 80% of the data) and evaluated the models on the external validation dataset (i.e. 20% of the data). after selecting the best predictive models, we created a web application to aid medical doctors and clinicians in the rapid screening of lymphedema patients. a dataset of 2137 patients was assembled from seoul national university bundang hospital. predictive models based on the random forest algorithm exhibited satisfactory performance (balanced accuracy = 87.0 +/- 0.7%, sensitivity = 84.3 +/- 0.6%, specificity = 89.1 +/- 1.5%, precision = 97.4 +/- 0.7%, f1 score = 90.4 +/- 0.4%, and auc = 0.931 +/- 0.007). we developed a web application to facilitate the swift screening of lymphedema among medical practitioners: https://snubhtxt.shinyapps.io/snubh_lymphedema. our study introduces a novel tool for the early detection of lymphedema and establishes the foundation for future investigations into predicting different stages of the condition.",AB_0077
"recent uncertainty quantification approaches lack transparency. algorithms often perform poorly in an input domain and the reason for poor performance remains unknown. therefore, we present a neural network training method that considers similar samples with sensitivity awareness in this paper. in the proposed nn training method for uq, first, we train a shallow nn for the point prediction. then, we train another nn to predict absolute differences between targets and predictions. in the next step, we select each sample in the training set one by one and compute both prediction and error sensitivities. then we select similar samples with sensitivity consideration and save indexes of similar samples. the ranges of an input parameter become narrower when the output is highly sensitive to that parameter. after that, we construct initial uncertainty bounds (ub) by considering the distribution of sensitivity-aware similar samples. prediction intervals (pis) from initial uncertainty bounds are larger and cover more samples than required. therefore, we train bound correction nn. as following all the steps for finding ub for each sample requires a lot of computation and memory access, we train a ub computation nn. the ub computation nn takes an input sample and provides an uncertainty bound. the ub computation nn is the final product of the proposed approach. we have achieved superior performance in most situations through the proposed transparent method. scripts of the proposed method are available in the following github repository: https://github.com/dipuk0506/uq",AB_0077
"the whale optimization algorithm (woa) is a widely used metaheuristic optimization approach with applications in various scientific and industrial domains. however, woa has a limitation of relying solely on the best solution to guide the population in subsequent iterations, overlooking the valuable information embedded in other candidate solutions. to address this limitation, we propose a novel and improved variant called pbest-guided differential woa (pdwoa). pdwoa combines the strengths of woa, particle swarm optimizer (pso), and differential evolution (de) algorithms to overcome these shortcomings. in this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed pdwoa algorithm on both benchmark and real-world optimization problems. the benchmark tests comprise 30-dimensional functions from cec 2014 test functions, while the real-world problems include pressure vessel optimal design, tension/compression spring optimal design, and welded beam optimal design. we present the simulation results, including the outcomes of non-parametric statistical tests including the wilcoxon signed-rank test and the friedman test, which validate the performance improvements achieved by pdwoa over other algorithms. the results of our evaluation demonstrate the superiority of pdwoa compared to recent methods, including the original woa. these findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid woa algorithm. furthermore, we offer recommendations for future research to further enhance its performance and open new avenues for exploration in the field of optimization algorithms. the matlab codes of fisa are publicly available at https://ithub.com/ebrahimakbary/pdwoa.",AB_0077
"to gain a better understanding of the complex human immune system, it is necessary to measure and interpret numerous cellular protein expressions at the single cell level. mass cytometry is a relatively new technology that offers unprecedented information about the protein expression of a single cell. conversely, the analysis of high-dimensional and multiparametric mass cytometric data sets presents a new computational challenge. for instance, conventional manual gating analysis was inefficient and unreliable for multiparametric phenotyping of the heterogeneous immune cellular system; consequently, automated methods have been developed to address the high dimensionality of mass cytometry data and enhance the reproducibility of the analysis. here, we present cygate, a semiautomated method for classifying single cells into their respective cell types. cygate learns a gating strategy from a reference data set, trains a model for cell classification, and then automatically analyzes additional data sets using the trained model. cygate also supports the machine learning framework for the classification of ungated cells, which are typically disregarded by automated methods. cygate's utility was demonstrated by its high performance in cell type classification and the lowest generalization error on various public data sets when compared to the state-of-the-art semiautomated methods. notably, cygate had the shortest execution time, allowing it to scale with a growing number of samples. cygate is available at https://github.com/seungjinna/cygate.",AB_0077
"motivation the origins of replication sites (oris) are precise regions inside the dna sequence where the replication process begins. these locations are critical for preserving the genome's integrity during cell division and guaranteeing the faithful transfer of genetic data from generation to generation. the advent of experimental techniques has aided in the discovery of oris in many species. experimentation, on the other hand, is often more time-consuming and pricey than computational approaches, and it necessitates specific equipment and knowledge. recently, ori sites have been predicted using computational techniques like motif-based searches and artificial intelligence algorithms based on sequence characteristics and chromatin states.results in this article, we developed ori-explorer, a unique artificial intelligence-based technique that combines multiple feature engineering techniques to train catboost classifier for recognizing oris from four distinct eukaryotic species. ori-explorer was created by utilizing a unique combination of three traditional feature-encoding techniques and a feature set obtained from a deep-learning neural network model. the ori-explorer has significantly outperformed current predictors on the testing dataset. furthermore, by employing the sophisticated shapley additive explanation method, we give crucial insights that aid in comprehending model success, highlighting the most relevant features vital for forecasting cell-specific oris. ori-explorer is also intended to aid community-wide attempts in discovering potential oris and developing innovative verifiable biological hypotheses.availability and implementation the used datasets along with the source code are made available through https://github.com/z-abbas/ori-explorer and https://zenodo.org/record/8358679.",AB_0077

"objectives neutrophils play a key role in anca-associated vasculitis, both as targets of autoimmunity and as facilitators of vascular damage. in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (gpa), the data regarding the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) in neutrophils are unclear. further, recent data suggests that ros production could have an anti-inflammatory effect through the regulation of inflammasomes and il-1-related cytokines. we aimed to analyse ros production in neutrophils from patients with gpa and investigate its association with il-1-related cytokines and the autoantigen pr3.methods seventy-two gpa patients with disease flare were included in the neutrovasc prospective cohort study. ros production in whole blood of patients with active gpa was evaluated and compared with that in the same patients in remission or healthy controls. associations between ros production, pr3 membrane expression on neutrophils, serum levels of il-1-related cytokines as well as inflammasome-related proteins were analysed.results we observed a robust defect in ros production by neutrophils from patients with active gpa compared with healthy controls, independent of glucocorticoid treatment. serum levels of il-1-related cytokines were significantly increased in gpa patients, particularly in patients with kidney involvement, and levels of these cytokines returned to normal after patients achieved remission. further, inflammasome-related proteins were significantly dysregulated in the cytosol of neutrophils as well as the serum from gpa patients.conclusion our data suggests that ros production and regulation of inflammasomes in neutrophils from patients with gpa are disturbed and may be a potential therapeutic target.trial registration clinicaltrials.gov, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov, nct01862068. graphical abstract",AB_0077
