"lung cancer, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting lung tissue, remains a significant contributor to mortality in both developed and developing nations. accurate biomarker identification is imperative for effective cancer diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. this study introduces the voting-based enhanced binary ebola optimization search algorithm (vbeosa), an innovative ensemble-based approach combining binary optimization and the ebola optimization search algorithm. vbeosa harnesses the collective power of the state-of-the-art classification models through soft voting. moreover, our research applies vbeosa to an extensive lung cancer gene expression dataset obtained from tcga, following essential preprocessing steps including outlier detection and removal, data normalization, and filtration. vbeosa aids in feature selection, leading to the discovery of key hub genes closely associated with lung cancer, validated through comprehensive protein-protein interaction analysis. notably, our investigation reveals ten significant hub genes-adrb2, actb, arrb2, gngt2, adrb1, actg1, acaca, atp5a1, adcy9, and adra1b-each demonstrating substantial involvement in the domain of lung cancer. furthermore, our pathway analysis sheds light on the prominence of strategic pathways such as salivary secretion and the calcium signaling pathway, providing invaluable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning lung cancer. we also utilize the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna) method to identify gene modules exhibiting strong correlations with clinical attributes associated with lung cancer. our findings underscore the efficacy of vbeosa in feature selection and offer profound insights into the multifaceted molecular landscape of lung cancer. finally, we are confident that this research has the potential to improve diagnostic capabilities and further enrich our understanding of the disease, thus setting the stage for future advancements in the clinical management of lung cancer. the vbeosa source codes is publicly available at https://github.com/tehnan/vbeosa-a-novel-feature-selection-algorithm-for-identifying-hub-genes-in-lung-cancer.",AB_0398
"background: carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (cre) are spreading in the united arab emirates (uae) where their dissemination is facilitated by international travel, trade, and tourism. the objective of this study is to describe the longitudinal changes of cre as reported by the national amr surveillance system of the uae.methods: in this study, we retrospectively describe cre isolated from 317 surveillance sites, including 87 hospitals and 230 centers/clinics from 2010 to 2021. the associated clinical, demographic, and microbiological characteristics are presented by relying on the uae national amr surveillance program. data was analyzed using whonet microbiology laboratory database software (http://www.whonet.org).results: a total of 14,593 carbapenem resistant enterobacterales were analyzed, of which 48.1% were carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp), 25.1% carbapenem resistant escherichia coli (crec), and 26.8% represented 72 other carbapenem resistant species. carbapenem resistant strains were mostly associated with adults and isolated from urine samples (36.9% of crkp and 66.6% of crec) followed by respiratory samples (26.95% for crkp) and soft tissue samples (19.5% for crkp). over the studied period carbapenem resistance rates remained high, especially in k. pneumoniae, and in 2021 were equivalent to 67.6% for imipenem, 76.2% for meropenem, and 91.6% for ertapenem. nevertheless, there was a statistically significant decreasing trend for imipenem and meropenem resistance in klebsiella species (p < 0.01) while the decrease in ertapenem resistance was non-significant. concerning e. coli, there was a statistically significant decreasing trend for meropenem and imipenem resistance over the 12 years, while ertapenem resistance increased significantly with 83.8% of e. coli exhibiting ertapenem resistance in 2021. resistance rates to ceftazidime and cefotaxime remained higher than 90% (in 2021) for crkp and cefotaxime rates increased to 90.5% in 2021 for crec. starting 2014, resistance to colistin and tigecycline was observed in carbapenem resistant enterobacterales. cre were associated with a higher mortality (rr: 6.3), admission to icu (rr 3.9), and increased length of stay (los; 10 excess inpatient days per cre case).conclusion: this study supports the need to monitor cre in the uae and draws attention to the significant increase of ertapenem resistance in e. coli. future surveillance analysis should include a genetic description of carbapenem resistance to provide new strategies.",AB_0398
"motivation in many high-dimensional prediction or classification tasks, complementary data on the features are available, e.g. prior biological knowledge on (epi)genetic markers. here we consider tasks with numerical prior information that provide an insight into the importance (weight) and the direction (sign) of the feature effects, e.g. regression coefficients from previous studies.results we propose an approach for integrating multiple sources of such prior information into penalized regression. if suitable co-data are available, this improves the predictive performance, as shown by simulation and application.availability and implementation the proposed method is implemented in the r package transreg (https://github.com/lcsb-bds/transreg, https://cran.r-project.org/package=transreg).",AB_0398
"as a widely applied theory that has found success across many fields, density functional theory (dft) is largely taught. typically, the most effective way to convey dft concepts is through illustrative examples that are currently lacking in available resources. in this work, we demonstrate total energy calculations for h-2 using 1s slater type orbitals (stos) within the framework of dft. the molecular orbitals are constructed from a linear combination of 1s stos centered on each atom. using the kohn-sham equation, an equivalent expression for total energy, based on kohn-sham orbital eigenvalues, is given, aligning with that of the hartree-fock method. detailed evaluations of slater and x-alpha exchange energies are presented along with a plotted potential energy surface and variations in density. comparison with sto-ng basis sets not only supports the current work but also demonstrates the superiority of 1s sto over them. these features are included in the h-2 jupyter notebook which is freely accessible at https://github.com/choirunnr/dft-h2-1s. additionally, the h-2 jupyter notebook was assessed for its implementation, receiving largely positive responses. consequently, this work offers a valuable complement to existing teaching resources and strategy.",AB_0398
"language identification and content detection are essential for ensuring effective digital communication, and content moderation. while extensive research has primarily focused on well-known and widely spoken languages, challenges persist when dealing with indigenous and resource-limited languages, especially between closely similar languages such as ethiopian languages. this article aims to simultaneously identify the language of a given text and detect its content, and to achieve this, we propose a novel attention-based recurrent neural network framework. the proposed method has an attention-embedded bidirectional-lstm architecture with two classifiers that identify the language of a given text and content within the text. the two classifiers share a common feature space before they branched at their task-specific layers where both layers are assisted by attention mechanism. we use five different topics in six ethiopian languages the dataset consists of nearly 22,624 sentences. we compared our result with the classical nlp techniques, the proposed method shortened the data prepossessing steps. we evaluated the model performance using the accuracy metric, achieving results of 98.88% for language identification and 96.5% for text content detection. the dataset, source code, and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/bdu-birhanu/lid_tcd.",AB_0398
"introductionfamily-focused adolescent & lifelong health promotion (flourish) project will adapt, implement and evaluate a programme to support adolescent mental health and well-being through strategies, such as strengthening parenting practices, adolescent-caregiver relationships, adolescent and parent socioemotional skills, and social support.methods and analysisthe project will focus on adolescents aged 10-14 years and their caregivers in north macedonia and moldova. the countries were selected based on implementation readiness of two organisations and a need for accessible evidence-informed services to help mitigate health risks due to economic, social and political challenges. parenting for lifelong health (plh) for parents and teens is a family-based programme developed for low-resource settings. plh has been adapted with input from advisory groups. the programme includes additional components to strengthen impacts on adolescents: adolescent mental health tools, based on unicef's helping adolescents thrive, adolescent peer support and participation booster. this pilot is first of three study phases. the pilot will be a feasibility testing of the adapted intervention and the assessment and implementation procedures to determine further refinements. the pilot will examine if the adapted programme is acceptable for adolescents, their families and providers, explore contextual factors relevant to embedding this programme into longer-term scale-up and investigate whether the programme can be delivered with fidelity and participation; whether the participants report changes in adolescent emotional and behavioural problems, well-being and other outcomes; and whether the study tools are feasible and appropriate. pre-post adolescent and caregiver questionnaires will provide outcome data. process evaluation will include attendance and fidelity data, and focus groups. we will examine delivery cost and resource requirements.ethics and disseminationthe study was approved at the university of klagenfurt (austria), medical faculty at st. cyril and methodius university (north macedonia) and national committee of ethical expertise for clinical trials (moldova). through stakeholder engagement and dissemination, flourish will advance scale-up of open-source family interventions.trial registration numbertrial registration: id101095528; project page: https://www.flourish-study.org/about.html; https://www.linkedin.com/company/flourish-study/",AB_0398
"objective over the past decade, the enhanced recovery after surgery (eras) program has demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in improving postoperative care and enhancing recovery across various surgical fields. preliminary results of eras protocol implementation in craniosynostosis surgery are presented.methods an eras protocol was developed and implemented for cranial pediatric neurosurgery, focusing on craniosynostosis repair. the study incorporated a pre-eras group consisting of a consecutive series of patients who underwent craniosynostosis repair surgery prior to the implementation of the eras protocol; the results were compared with a consecutive group of patients who had been prospectively collected since the introduction of the eras for cranio-synostosis protocol. the safety, feasibility, and efficiency of the eras protocol in pediatric neurosurgery was evaluated, through the collection of clinical data from the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phase. surgery-related complications were evaluated according to the clavien-dindo classification. costs of the stays were obtained using a microcosting approach.results a total of 35 pre-eras patients and 10 eras patients were included. scaphocephaly was the most common pathology in both groups. the overall compliance with the pre-, intra-, and postoperative criteria significantly increased- from 35.5%, 64.4%, and 54.7%, respectively, in each phase to 94%, 90%, and 84% (p < 0.001). the authors noticed a reduction in the average opioid dose used per patient in the eras group (p = 0.004), and they observed a trend toward a decreased mean length of stay from 5.2 days in the pre-eras group to 4.6 days in the eras group, without an in-crease of the rate of readmission within 30 days of surgery. the rate of complications decreased but this difference was not statistically significant. the hospital costs lowered significantly: from 21,958 confederatio helvetica francs (chf) in the pre-eras group to 18,936 chf in the eras group (p = 0.02).conclusions the eras protocol represents a safe and cost-effective tool for the perioperative management of craniosynostosis. it showed its positive impact on the analgesia provided and on the reduction of in-hospital costs for these patients. eras protocols may thus be interesting options in the pediatric neurosurgical field. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2023.9.focus23540",AB_0398
"the analysis of data over space and time is a core part of descriptive epidemiology, but the complexity of spatiotemporal data makes this challenging. there is a need for methods that simplify the exploration of such data for tasks such as surveillance and hypothesis generation. in this paper, we use combined clustering and dimensionality reduction methods (hereafter referred to as 'cluster embedding' methods) to spatially visualize patterns in epidemiological time-series data. we compare several cluster embedding techniques to see which performs best along a variety of internal cluster validation metrics. we find that methods based on k-means clustering generally perform better than self-organizing maps on real world epidemiological data, with some minor exceptions. we also introduce epivecs, a tool which allows the user to perform cluster embedding and explore the results using interactive visualization. epivecs is available as a privacy preserving, in-browser open source web application at https://episphere.github.io/epivecs.",AB_0398
"objective: breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the first cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. in 90% of the cases, mortality is related to distant metastasis. computer-aided prognosis systems using machine learning models have been widely used to predict breast cancer metastasis. despite that, these systems still face several challenges. first, the models are generally biased toward the majority class due to datasets unbalance. second, their increased complexity is associated with decreased interpretability which causes clinicians to distrust their prognosis. methods: to tackle these issues, we have proposed an explainable approach for predicting breast cancer metastasis using clinicopathological data. our approach is based on cost-sensitive catboost classifier and utilises lime explainer to provide patient-level explanations. results: we used a public dataset of 716 breast cancer patients to assess our approach. the results demonstrate the superiority of cost-sensitive catboost in precision (76.5%), recall (79.5%), and f1-score (77%) over classical and boosting models. the lime explainer was used to quantify the impact of patient and treatment characteristics on breast cancer metastasis, revealing that they have different impacts ranging from high impact like the non-use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and moderate impact including carcinoma with medullary features histological type, to low impact like oral contraception use. the code is available at https://github.com/ikrammaouche/cs-catboost conclusion: our approach serves as a first step toward introducing more efficient and explainable computer-aided prognosis systems for breast cancer metastasis prediction.",AB_0398
"introduction pseudomonas is a group of ubiquitous non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria (nfgnb). of the several species associated with humans, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) can acclimate to diverse environments. the global frequency of pa infections is rising and is complicated by this organism's high intrinsic and acquired resistance to several clinically relevant antibiotics. data on the epidemiology, levels, and trends of antimicrobial resistance of pa in clinical settings in the mena/gcc region is scarce.methods a retrospective 12-year analysis of 56,618 non-duplicate diagnostic pseudomonas spp. from the united arab emirates (uae) was conducted. data was generated at 317 surveillance sites by routine patient care during 2010-2021, collected by trained personnel and reported by participating surveillance sites to the uae national antimicrobial resistance (amr) surveillance program. data analysis was conducted with whonet (https://whonet.org/).results among the total isolates (n = 56,618), the majority were pa (95.6%). data on nationality revealed 44.1% were uae nationals. most isolates were from soft tissue (55.7%), followed by respiratory tract (26.7%). pa was more commonly found among inpatients than among outpatients, followed by icus. pa showed a horizontal trend for resistance to fluoroquinolones, 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins, and decreasing trends of resistance for aminoglycosides and meropenem. the highest percentage of multidrug resistant (mdr) isolates was reported in 2011 at 35.6%. as an overall trend, the percentage of mdr, extensively drug-resistant (xdr), and possible pandrug-resistant (pdr) isolates generally declined over the study period. carbapenem-resistant pa (crpa) were associated with a higher mortality (rr: 2.7), increased admission to icu (rr: 2.3), and increased length of stay (los) (12 excess inpatient days per case), as compared to carbapenem-susceptible pa (cspa).conclusion the resistance trends in pseudomonas species in the uae indicated a decline in amr and in percentages of pseudomonas isolates with mdr and xdr profiles. the sustained pseudomonas spp. circulation particularly in the hospital settings highlights the importance of surveillance techniques, infection control strategies, and stewardship to limit the continued dissemination. this data also shows that crpa are associated with higher mortality, increased icu admission rates, and a longer hospitalization, thus higher costs due to increased number of in-hospital and icu days.",AB_0398
