"feature matching is a long-standing fundamental and critical problem in computer vision and photogrammetry. the indirect matching strategy has become a popular choice because of its high precision and generality, but it finds only a limited number of correct matches, and the mismatch removal phase does not utilize the critical feature descriptors. to this end, this paper proposes a novel and effective feature matching method, named progressive smoothness consensus (psc). our psc designs an objective function to directly construct correct matches from two feature point sets. to optimize the objective, we introduce a stepwise strategy, where a small but reliable match set with the smooth function is used as initialization, and then the correct match set is iteratively enlarged and optimized by match expansion and smooth function estimation, respectively. in addition, the local geometric constraint is added to the compact representation with a fourier basis, thus improving the estimation precision. we perform the match expansion as a bayesian formulation to exploit both the spatial distribution and feature description information, thus finding feasible matches to expand the match set. extensive experiments on feature matching, homography & fundamental matrix estimation, and image registration are conducted, which demonstrate the advantages of our psc against state-of-the-art methods in terms of generality and effectiveness. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/xiayifan1999/robust-feature-matching-via-progressive-smoothness-consensus.",AB_0193
"traffic prediction problem is one of the essential tasks of intelligent transportation system (its), alleviating traffic congestion effectively and promoting the intelligent development of urban traffic. to accommodate long-range dependencies, transformer-based methods have been used in traffic prediction tasks due to the parallelizable processing of sequences and explanation of attention matrices compared with recurrent neural units (rnns). however, the transformer-based model has two limitations, on the one hand, it ignores the local correlation in the traffic state in its parallel processing of the sequence, on the other hand, the absolute positional embedding is adopted to represent the positional relationship of time nodes is destroyed when it comes to calculate attention score. to address two embarrassing shortcomings, a novel framework called rpconvformer is proposed, where the improved parts are 1d causal convolutional sequence embedding and relative position encoding. in sequence embedding, we develop a sequence embedding layer composed of convolutional units, which consist of origin 1d convolutional and 1d causal convolutional. the size of the receptive field of the convolution can focus on the local region correlation of the sequence. in relative position encoding, we introduce a bias vector to automatically learn the relative position information of time nodes when linearly mapping the feature tensor. we respect the encoding and decoding framework of the transformer, the encoder is responsible for extracting historical traffic state information, and the decoder autoregressively predicts the future traffic state. the multi-head attention mechanism is adopted by both encoder and decoder aims to focus on rich temporal feature patterns. moreover, key mask technique is used after computing attention matrix to mask the traffic state at missing moments improving the resilience of the model. extensive experiments on two real-world traffic flow datasets. the results show that rpconvformer achieves the best performance compared to state-of-the-art time series models. ablation experiments show that considering the local correlation of time series has a higher gain on prediction performance. random mask experiments show that the model is robust when the historical data is less than 10% missing. in addition, multi-head attention matrix provides further explanation for the dependence between time nodes. rpconvformer as an improved transformer-based model can provide new ideas for molding temporal dimension in traffic prediction tasks. our code has been open-sourced at (https://github.com/yanjiewen/rpconvformer).",AB_0193
"identification of the dna-binding protein (dbp) helps dig out information embedded in the dna-protein interaction, which is significant to understanding the mechanisms of dna replication, transcription, and repair. although existing computational methods for predicting the dbps based on protein sequences have obtained great success, there is still room for improvement since the sequence-order information is not fully mined in these methods. in this study, a new three-part sequence -order feature extraction (called tpso) strategy is developed to extract more discriminative information from protein sequences for predicting the dbps. for each query protein, tpso first divides its primary sequence features into n-and c-terminal fragments and then extracts the numerical pseudo features of three parts including the full sequence and these two fragments, respectively. based on tpso, a novel deep learning-based method, called tpso-dbp, is proposed, which employs the sequence-based single-view features, the bidirectional long short-term memory (bilstm) and fully connected (fc) neural networks to learn the dbp prediction model. empirical outcomes reveal that tpso-dbp can achieve an accuracy of 87.01%, covering 85.30% of all dbps, while achieving a matthew's correlation coefficient value (0.741) that is significantly higher than most existing state-of-the-art dbp prediction methods. detailed data analyses have indicated that the advantages of tpso-dbp lie in the utilization of tpso, which helps extract more concealed prominent patterns, and the deep neural network framework composed of bilstm and fc that learns the nonlinear relationships between input features and dbps. the standalone package and web server of tpso-dbp are freely available at https:// jun-csbio.github.io/tpso-dbp/.",AB_0193
"metagenomic sequencing facilitates large-scale constitutional analysis and functional characterization of complex microbial communities without cultivation. recent advances in long-read sequencing techniques utilize long-range information to simplify repeat-aware metagenomic assembly puzzles and complex genome binning tasks. however, it remains methodologically challenging to remove host-derived dna sequences from the microbial community at the read resolution due to high sequencing error rates and the absence of reference genomes. we here present symbiont-screener (https://github.com/bgi-qingdao/symbiont-screener), a reference-free approach to identifying high-confidence host's long reads from symbionts and contaminants and overcoming the low sequencing accuracy according to a trio-based screening model. the remaining host's sequences are then automatically grouped by unsupervised clustering. when applied to both simulated and real long-read datasets, it maintains higher precision and recall rates of identifying the host's raw reads compared to other tools and hence promises the high-quality reconstruction of the host genome and associated metagenomes. furthermore, we leveraged both pacbio hifi and nanopore long reads to separate the host's sequences on a real host-microbe system, an algal-bacterial sample, and retrieved an obvious improvement of host assembly in terms of assembly contiguity, completeness, and purity. more importantly, the residual symbiotic microbiomes illustrate improved genomic profiling and assemblies after the screening, which elucidates a solid basis of data for downstream bioinformatic analyses, thus providing a novel perspective on symbiotic research.",AB_0193
"image captioning aims to generate descriptive sentences to describe image main contents. existing attention-based approaches mainly focus on the salient visual features in the image. however, ignoring the learning relationship between local features and global features may cause local features to lose the interaction with global concepts, generating impropriate or inaccurate relationship words/phrases in the sentences. to alleviate the above issue, in this work we propose the double-level relationship networks (dlrn) that novelly exploits the complementary local features and global features in the image, and enhances the relationship between features. technically, dlrn builds two types of networks, separate relationship network and unified relationship embedding network. the former learns different hierarchies of visual relationship by performing graph attention for local-level relationship enhancement and pixel-level relationship enhancement respectively. the latter takes the global features as the guide to learn the local-global relationship between local regions and global concepts, and obtains the feature representation containing rich relationship information. further, we devise an attention-based feature fusion module to fully utilize the contribution of different modalities. it effectively fuses the previously obtained relationship features and original region features. extensive experiments on three typical datasets verify that our dlrn significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. more remarkably, dlrn achieves the competitive performance while maintaining notable model efficiency. the source code is available at the github https://github.com/runcode90/imagecaptioning.",AB_0193
"biomedical image segmentation is one critical component in computer-aided system diagnosis. however, various non-automatic segmentation methods are usually designed to segment target objects with single-task driven, ignoring the potential contribution of multi-task, such as the salient object detection (sod) task and the image segmentation task. in this paper, we propose a novel dual-task framework for white blood cell (wbc) and skin lesion (sl) saliency detection and segmentation in biomedical images, called saliency-cce. saliency-cce consists of a preprocessing of hair removal for skin lesions images, a novel colour contextual extractor (cce) module for the sod task and an improved adaptive threshold (at) paradigm for the image segmentation task. in the sod task, we perform the cce module to extract hand-crafted features through a novel colour channel volume (ccv) block and a novel colour activation mapping (cam) block. we first exploit the ccv block to generate a target object's region of interest (roi). after that, we employ the cam block to yield a refined salient map as the final salient map from the extracted roi. we propose a novel adaptive threshold (at) strategy in the segmentation task to automatically segment the wbc and sl from the final salient map. we evaluate our proposed saliency-cce on the isic-2016, the isic-2017, and the scisc datasets, which outperform representative state-of-the-art sod and biomedical image segmentation approaches. our code is available at https://github.com/zxg3017/saliency-cce.",AB_0193

"identifying petition expectation for government response plays an important role in government administrative service. although some petition platforms allow citizens to label the petition expectation when they submit e-petitions, the misunderstanding and misselection of petition labels still has necessitated manual classification involved. automatic petition expectation identification has faced challenges in poor context information, heavy noise and casual syntactic structure of the petition text. in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning based method for petition expectation (citizens' demands for the level of government response) correction and identification named pecidrl. we collect a dataset from message board for leaders, the largest official petition platform in china, containing 237,042 petitions. firstly, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning framework to automatically correct the mislabeled and ambiguous labels of the petitions. then, multi-view textual features, including word-level and document-level semantic features, sentiment features and different textual graph representations are extracted and integrated to enrich more auxiliary information. furthermore, based on the corrected petitions, 19 novel petition expectation identification models are constructed by extending 11 popular machine learning models for petition expectation detection. finally, comprehensive comparison and evaluation are conducted to select the final petition expectation identification model with the best performance. after performing correction by pecidrl, each metric on all extended petition expectation identification models improves by an average of 8.3% with the highest increase ratio reaching 14.2%. the optimal model is determined as peti-svm-bert with the highest accuracy 93.66%. we also analyze the petition expectation label variation of the dataset by using pecidrl. we derive that 16.9% of e-petitioners tend to exaggerate the urgency of their petitions to make the government pay high attention to their appeals and 4.4% of the petitions urgency are underestimated. this study has substantial academic and practical value in improving government efficiency. additionally, a web-server is developed to facilitate government administrators and other researchers, which can be accessed at http://www.csbg-jlu.info/pecidrl/.",AB_0193
"background: immunotherapy has been approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for the treatment of non-metastatic colorectal cancer remains unclear. we tried to explore clinical effect of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the treatment of non-metastatic colorectal cancer.methods: we searched the databases (pubmed, wanfang embase, cochrane library and china national knowledge infrastructure databases) to obtain suitable articles up to september 2022. the primary outcomes of pathological complete response (pcrs), major pathological response (mpr), objective response rate (orr), r0-resection and anus preserving rate were collected and evaluated. secordary outcomes (pcrs and mpr) of subgroup analysis between deficient mismatch repair/microsatellite instability-high group (dmmr/msi-h) and proficient mismatch repair/microsatellite stable group (pmmr/mss) and outcomes for rectal cancer were analyzed for the final results.results: we included ten articles and 410 cases of non-metastatic colorectal cancer with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. there were 113 (27.5%) cases with the dmmr/msi-h status and 167 (40.7%) cases with the pmmr/mss status. pcrs was found in 167/373 (44.6%) patients (es: 0.49, 95% ci: 0.36 to 0.62, p < 0.01, chi(2) = 65.3, p < 0.01, i (2) = 86.2%) and mpr was found in 194/304 (63.8%) patients (es: 0.66, 95% ci: 0.54 to 0.78, p < 0.01, chi(2) = 42.55, p < 0.01, i (2) = 81.2%) with the random-effects model and huge heterogeneity. in the subgroup analysis, pcrs was higher in the dmmr/msi-h group than the pmmr/mss group in the fixed-effects model with minimal heterogeneity (or: 3.55, 95% ci: 1.74 to 7.27, p < 0.01, chi(2) = 1.86, p=0.6, i (2) = 0%). pcrs was found in 58/172 (33.9%) rectal cancer patients (es: 0.33, 95% ci: 0.26 to 0.40, p < 0.01, chi(2) = 3.04, p=0.55, i (2) = 0%) with the fixed-effects model and little heterogeneity.conclusion: neoadjuvant immunotherapy could increase pcrs and mpr rate for non-metastatic colorectal cancer. neoadjuvant immunotherapy could achieve better pcrs rate in dmmr/msi-h group than in the pmmr/mss group. neoadjuvant immunotherapy could be another treatment option for non-metastatic colorectal cancer.systematic review registration:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#myprospero, identifier crd42022350523.",AB_0193
