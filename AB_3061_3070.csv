"in the news recommendation, users are overwhelmed by thousands of news daily, which makes the users' behavior data have high sparsity. therefore, only considering a single user's personalized preferences cannot support the news recommendation. how to improve the relatedness of news and users and reduce data sparsity has become a hot issue. recent studies have attempted to use graph models to enrich the relationship between users and news, but they are still limited to modeling the historical behaviors of a single user. to fill the gap, we integrate user-news relationships and the overall user historical clicked news sequences to construct a global heterogeneous transition graph. and a refinement approach is proposed to recognize the news transition patterns in the graph. based on the global heterogeneous transition graph, we propose a heterogeneous transition graph attention network to capture the common behavior patterns of most users to enhance the representation of user interest. fusing the users' personalized and common interest, we propose the gainrec model to recommend news effectively. extensive experiments are conducted on two public news recommendation datasets, and the results show the superiority of the proposed gainrec model compared with the state-of-the-art news recommendation models. the implementation of our model is available at https://github.com/newsrec/gainrec.",AB_0307
"spaced repetition, namely, learners review items in a given schedule, has been proven powerful for memorization and practice of skills. most current spaced repetition methods focus on either predicting student recall or designing an optimal review schedule, thus omitting the integrity of the spaced repetition system. in this work, we propose a novel spaced repetition schedule framework by capturing the dynamics of memory, which alternates memory prediction and schedule optimization to improve the efficiency of learners' reviews. first, the framework collects logs from students' reviews and builds memory models with markov property to capture the dynamics of memory. then, the spaced repetition optimization is transformed a stochastic shortest path problem and solved via the value iteration method. we also construct a new benchmark dataset for spaced repetition, which is the first to contain time-series information during learners' memorization. experimental results on the collected data from the real world and the simulated environment demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces 64% error and 17% cost in predicting recall rates and optimizing schedules compared to several baselines. we have publicly released the dataset containing 220 million rows and codes used in this paper at: https://github.com/maimemo/ssp-mmc-plus.",AB_0307
"learning with streaming data has attracted extensive research interest in recent years. existing online learning approaches have specific assumptions regarding data streams, such as requiring fixed or varying feature spaces with explicit patterns and balanced class distributions. while the data streams generated in many real scenarios commonly have arbitrarily incomplete feature spaces and dynamic imbalanced class distributions, making existing approaches be unsuitable for real applications. to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel online learning from incomplete and imbalanced data streams (oli (2) ds) algorithm. oli 2 ds has a two-fold main idea: 1) it follows the empirical risk minimization principle to identify the most informative features of incomplete feature spaces, and 2) it develops a dynamic cost strategy to handle imbalanced class distributions in real-time by transforming f-measure optimization into a weighted surrogate loss minimization. to evaluate oli (2) ds, we compare it with stateof-the-art related algorithms in three kinds of experiments. first, we adopt 14 real datasets to simulate three scenarios of incomplete feature spaces, i.e., trapezoidal, feature evolvable, and capricious data streams. second, based on a benchmark online analyzer, we generate 13 datasets to simulate incomplete data streams with different imbalance ratios. third, we analyze concept drift in two simulated scenes, i.e., online learning and data stream mining, and verify the adaption of oli (2) ds on repeated concept drifts and variable imbalance ratios. the results demonstrate that oli (2) ds achieves a significantly better performance than its rivals. besides, a real-world case study on movie review classification is conducted to elaborate on our oli (2) ds algorithm's effectiveness. code is released at https://github.com/youdianlong/oli2ds.",AB_0307
"mapping woody vegetation from aerial images is an important task bluein environment monitoring and management. a few studies have shown that semantic segmentation methods involving deep learning achieve significantly better performance in mapping than methods involving field-based measurement and handcrafted features. however, current deep networks used for mapping vegetation require labour-intensive pixel-level annotations. thus, this paper proposes the use of image-level annotations and a weakly supervised semantic segmentation (wsss) network for mapping woody vegetation based on unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) imagery. the network comprises a localization branch (lb) and an attention relocation branch (arb). the lb is trained in stage 1 of the mapping to identify regions with the most discriminative vegetation, while the arb is introduced to better mine semantic information, which enhances the ability of the class activation maps (cams) to represent useful information. the arb inherits the weights from the lb in stage 2 and uses a multi-layer attention refocus structure (mars) into the network to expand the receptive field to enable the model to process global features. thus, same-category regions that are located farther apart are better captured. finally, the region focused by the dual branches are integrated to more accurately cover the areas to be segmented. using uav imagery datasets, namely uopnoa and minifrance, along with quantitative metrics and qualitative results, the network demonstrates performance better than existing state-of-the-art related methods. the effectiveness and generalization of each module of the network are validated by ablation experiments. the code for implementing the network will be accessible on https://github.com/mr-catc/dwslnet.",AB_0307
"data visualization empowers researchers to communicate their results that support scientific reasoning in an intuitive way. three-dimension (3d) spatially resolved transcriptomic atlases constructed from multi-view and high-dimensional data have rapidly emerged as a powerful tool to unravel spatial gene expression patterns and cell type distribution in biological samples, revolutionizing the understanding of gene regulatory interactions and cell niches. however, limited accessible tools for data visualization impede the potential impact and application of this technology. here we introduce vt3d, a visualization toolbox that allows users to explore 3d transcriptomic data, enabling gene expression projection to any 2d plane of interest, 2d virtual slice creation and visualization, and interactive 3d data browsing with surface model plots. in addition, it can either work on personal devices in standalone mode or be hosted as a web-based server. we apply vt3d to multiple datasets produced by the most popular techniques, including both sequencing-based approaches (stereo-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and slide-seq) and imaging-based approaches (merfish and starmap), and successfully build a 3d atlas database that allows interactive data browsing. we demonstrate that vt3d bridges the gap between researchers and spatially resolved transcriptomics, thus accelerating related studies such as embryogenesis and organogenesis processes. the source code of vt3d is available at https://github.com/bgi-qingdao/vt3d, and the modeled atlas database is available at http://www.bgiocean.com/vt3d_example. copyright (c) 2023, the authors. institute of genetics and developmental biology, chinese academy of sciences, and genetics society of china. published by elsevier limited and science press. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0307
"recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies have enabled unprecedented opportunities to elucidate tissue architecture and function in situ. spatial transcriptomics can provide multimodal and complementary information simultaneously, including gene expression profiles, spatial locations, and histology images. however, most existing methods have limitations in efficiently utilizing spatial information and matched high-resolution histology images. to fully leverage the multi-modal information, we propose a spatially embedded deep attentional graph clustering (spadac) method to identify spatial domains while reconstructing denoised gene expression profiles. this method can efficiently learn the low- dimensional embeddings for spatial transcriptomics data by constructing multi-view graph modules to capture both spatial location connectives and morphological connectives. benchmark results demonstrate that spadac outperforms other algorithms on several recent spatial transcriptomics datasets. spadac is a valuable tool for spatial domain detection, facilitating the comprehension of tissue architecture and cellular microenvironment. the source code of spadac is freely available at github (https://github.com/huoyuying/spadac. git).",AB_0307

"robots have always found it challenging to grasp in cluttered scenes because of the complex background in-formation and changing operating environment. therefore, in order to enable robots to perform multi-object grasping tasks in a wider range of application scenarios, such as object sorting on industrial production lines and object manipulation by home service robots, we innovatively integrated segmentation and grasp detection into the same framework, and designed a simultaneous instance segmentation and grasp detection network (sisg-net). by using the network, robots can better interact with complex environments and perform grasp tasks. in order to solve the problem of insufficient fusion of the existing rgbd fusion strategy in the robot field, we propose a lightweight rgb-d fusion module called smcf to make modal fusion more efficient. in order to solve the problem of inaccurate perception of small objects in different scenes, we propose the ffasp module. finally, we use the aff module to adaptively fuse multi-scale features. segmentation can remove noise information from the background, enabling the robot to grasp in different backgrounds with robustness. using the segmentation result, we refine grasp detection and find the best grasp pose for robot grasping in complex scenes. our grasp detection model performs similarly to state-of-the-art grasp detection algorithms on the cornell dataset. our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ocid dataset. we show that the method is stable and robust in real-world grasping experiments. the code and video of our experiment used in this paper can be found at: https://github.com/meiguiz/sisg-net.",AB_0307
"height estimation from single remote sensing image is a challenging inherently ambiguous and technically ill-posed problem that we address in this study by resorting to deep learning approach. a spatial enhanced and multi-scale aggregated encoder-decoder network, sm-ednet, is proposed, which takes a single image as input and produces an estimated height map as output. first, residual network (resnet) is applied to extract low-level and deep features to cope with the heterogeneous characteristics of remote sensing scenes. then, the multi-scale context information is aggregated through denseaspp (dense atrous spatial pyramid pooling) by extracting features from multiple dilated convolution layers. the skip connection is constructed by using the structure preserving model, dulr, to aggregate resnet low-level features and multi-scale high-level features. the deformable convolution module is constructed to enhance the sensitivity to differences in geometric shapes of ground objects. for model training, three-layer deep supervision mechanism is designed to counteract the adverse effects of unstable gradients changes. experimental results on three benchmark datasets, including isprs vaihingen, isprs potsdam, and dfc2018, show that the proposed method achieves the most outstanding performance compared with the state-of-the-art networks. the source codes are available at: https://github.com/xjh0929/2height.",AB_0307
"fetal heart rate (fhr) is critical for assessing fetal health and diagnosing disorders, such as fetal distress, congenital heart disease, and intrauterine growth retardation. with the rapid development of the internet of medical things (iomt), fetal r-peak detection plays an important role in diagnosing heart defects during pregnancy. however, due to the nonlinear mixing of multiple sources in the noninvasive signals and the low signal-to-noise ratio (snr), it is difficult to obtain accurate r-peak detection result. this article presents a dual self-calibrating system based on a spectral attention kernel independent component analysis (sa-kica) module and a self-calibrating fetal r-peak detection (sc-frd) module. sa-kica is an ica-based calibration module constructed by the spectral attention mechanism, which was sought from short-time fourier transform (stft) and was shipped back to original signal with convolution to achieve perfect maternal electrocardiogram (mecg) separation in high-dimensional linear separable space. then, a periodic and morphological-based channel selector is designed to select the optimal mecg. after mecg removal, to further improve the performance of fetal r-peak detection, the sc-frd module is introduced to utilize the interior peak information and self-calibrating strategy, which includes variance-based fetal r-peak seed selection, time-varying coarse prediction, and adaptive probability mask calibration. the proposed framework is a primary attempt to concurrently introduce the nonlinear feature, spectral information, and self-calibrating strategy in the field of fetal ecg processing. the framework achieved excellent performance in fetal r-peak detection accuracy on a simulated data set and two public data sets with varying divergence and richness of resources. the experimental results show that our framework is superior to existing methods and can be used as a potential fetal monitoring method in the application of iomt. the code is released in https://github.com/bfyjr/ni-fecg-extraction.",AB_0307
