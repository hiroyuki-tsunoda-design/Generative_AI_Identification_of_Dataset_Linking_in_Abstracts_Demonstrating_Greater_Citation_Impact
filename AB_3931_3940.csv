"the role and biological impact of structural variation (sv) are increasingly evident. deletion accounts for 40% of sv and is an important type of sv. therefore, it is of great significance to detect and genotype deletions. at present, high accurate long reads can be obtained as hifi reads. and, through a combination of error-prone long reads and high accurate short reads, we can also get accurate long reads. these accurate long reads are helpful for detecting and genotyping svs. however, due to the complexity of genome and alignment information, detecting and genotyping svs remain a challenging task. here, we propose lsnet, an approach for detecting and genotyping deletions with a deep learning network. because of the ability of deep learning to learn complex features in labeled datasets, it is beneficial for detecting sv. first, lsnet divides the reference genome into continuous sub-regions. based on the alignment between the sequencing data (the combination of error-prone long reads and short reads or hifi reads) and the reference genome, lsnet extracts nine features for each sub-region, and these features are considered as signal of deletion. second, lsnet uses a convolutional neural network and an attention mechanism to learn critical features in every sub-region. next, in accordance with the relationship among the continuous sub-regions, lsnet uses a gated recurrent units (gru) network to further extract more important deletion signatures. and a heuristic algorithm is present to determine the location and length of deletions. experimental results show that lsnet outperforms other methods in terms of the f1 score. the source code is available from github at .https://github.com/eioyuou/lsnet",AB_0394
"background identifying patients with clinically significant prostate cancer (cspca) before biopsy helps reduce unnec-essary biopsies and improve patient prognosis. the diagnostic performance of traditional transrectal ultrasound (trus) for cspca is relatively limited. this study was aimed to develop a high-performance convolutional neural network (cnn) model (p-net) based on a trus video of the entire prostate and investigate its efficacy in identifying cspca. methods between january 2021 and december 2022, this study prospectively evaluated 832 patients from four centres who underwent prostate biopsy and/or radical prostatectomy. all patients had a standardised trus video of the whole prostate. a two-dimensional cnn (2d p-net) and three-dimensional cnn (3d p-net) were constructed using the training cohort (559 patients) and tested on the internal validation cohort (140 patients) as well as on the external validation cohort (133 patients). the performance of 2d p-net and 3d p-net in predicting cspca was assessed in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc), biopsy rate, and unnecessary biopsy rate, and compared with the trus 5-point likert score system as well as multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-mri) prostate imaging reporting and data system (pi-rads) v2.1. decision curve analyses (dcas) were used to determine the net benefits associated with their use. the study is registered at https://www.chictr. org.cn with the unique identifier chictr2200064545. findings the diagnostic performance of 3d p-net (auc: 0.85-0.89) was superior to trus 5-point likert score system (auc: 0.71-0.78, p = 0.003-0.040), and similar to mp-mri pi-rads v2.1 score system interpreted by experienced radiologists (auc: 0.83-0.86, p = 0.460-0.732) and 2d p-net (auc: 0.79-0.86, p = 0.066-0.678) in the internal and external validation cohorts. the biopsy rate decreased from 40.3% (trus 5-point likert score system) and 47.6% (mp-mri pi-rads v2.1 score system) to 35.5% (2d p-net) and 34.0% (3d p-net). the unnecessary biopsy rate decreased from 38.1% (trus 5-point likert score system) and 35.2% (mp-mri pi-rads v2.1 score system) to 32.0% (2d p-net) and 25.8% (3d p-net). 3d p-net yielded the highest net benefit according to the dcas. interpretation 3d p-net based on a prostate grayscale trus video achieved satisfactory performance in identifying cspca and potentially reducing unnecessary biopsies. more studies to determine how ai models better integrate into routine practice and randomized controlled trials to show the values of these models in real clinical applications are warranted.",AB_0394
"thoracic paravertebral block (tpvb) is a common method of inducing perioperative analgesia in thoracic and abdominal surgery. identifying anatomical structures in ultrasound images is very important especially for inexperienced anesthesiologists who are unfamiliar with the anatomy. therefore, our aim was to develop an artificial neural network (ann) to automatically identify (in real-time) anatomical structures in ultrasound images of tpvb. this study is a retrospective study using ultrasound scans (both video and standard still images) that we acquired. we marked the contours of the paravertebral space (pvs), lung, and bone in the tpvb ultrasound image. based on the labeled ultrasound images, we used the u-net framework to train and create an ann that enabled real-time identification of important anatomical structures in ultrasound images. a total of 742 ultrasound images were acquired and labeled in this study. in this ann, the intersection over union (iou) and dice similarity coefficient (dsc or dice coefficient) of the paravertebral space (pvs) were 0.75 and 0.86, respectively, the iou and dsc of the lung were 0.85 and 0.92, respectively, and the iou and dsc of the bone were 0.69 and 0.83, respectively. the accuracies of the pvs, lung, and bone were 91.7%, 95.4%, and 74.3%, respectively. for tenfold cross validation, the median interquartile range for pvs iou and dsc was 0.773 and 0.87, respectively. there was no significant difference in the scores for the pvs, lung, and bone between the two anesthesiologists. we developed an ann for the real-time automatic identification of thoracic paravertebral anatomy. the performance of the ann was highly satisfactory. we conclude that ai has good prospects for use in tpvb. clinical registration number: chictr2200058470 (url: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=152839; registration date: 2022-04-09).",AB_0394
"traditional supervised learning methods require large quantities of labeled data. however, labeling sleep data according to polysomnography by well-trained sleep experts is a very tedious job. in the present day, the development of self supervised learning methods is making significant progress in many fields. it is also possible to apply some of these methods to sleep staging. this is to remove the dependency on labeled data at the stage of representation extraction. nevertheless, they often rely too much on negative samples for sample selection and construction. therefore, we propose psnsleep, a novel self-supervised learning method for sleep staging based on siamese networks. the crucial step to the success of our method is to select appropriate data augmentations (the time shift block) to construct the positive sample pair. psnsleep achieves satisfactory results without relying on any negative samples. we evaluate psnsleep on sleepedf and isruc-sleep and achieve accuracy of 80.0% and 74.4%. the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/arthurxl/psnsleep.",AB_0394
"we present analysis using a citizen science campaign to improve the cosmological measures from the hobby-eberly telescope dark energy experiment (hetdex). the goal of hetdex is to measure the hubble expansion rate, h(z), and angular diameter distance, d (a)(z), at z = 2.4, each to percent-level accuracy. this accuracy is determined primarily from the total number of detected lya emitters (laes), the false positive rate due to noise, and the contamination due to [o ii] emitting galaxies. this paper presents the citizen science project, dark energy explorers ( (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/erinmc/dark-energy-explorers), with the goal of increasing the number of laes and decreasing the number of false positives due to noise and the [o ii] galaxies. initial analysis shows that citizen science is an efficient and effective tool for classification most accurately done by the human eye, especially in combination with unsupervised machine learning. three aspects from the citizen science campaign that have the most impact are (1) identifying individual problems with detections, (2) providing a clean sample with 100% visual identification above a signal-to-noise cut, and (3) providing labels for machine-learning efforts. since the end of 2022, dark energy explorers has collected over three and a half million classifications by 11,000 volunteers in over 85 different countries around the world. by incorporating the results of the dark energy explorers, we expect to improve the accuracy on the d (a)(z) and h(z) parameters at z = 2.'' 4 by 10%-30%. while the primary goal is to improve on hetdex, dark energy explorers has already proven to be a uniquely powerful tool for science advancement and increasing accessibility to science worldwide.",AB_0394

"introduction: golgi is one of the components of the inner membrane system in eukaryotic cells. its main function is to send the proteins involved in the synthesis of endoplasmic reticulum to specific parts of cells or secrete them outside cells. it can be seen that golgi is an important organelle for eukaryotic cells to synthesize proteins. golgi disorders can cause various neurodegenerative and genetic diseases, and the accurate classification of golgi proteins is helpful to develop corresponding therapeutic drugs. methods: this paper proposed a novel golgi proteins classification method, which is golgi_df with the deep forest algorithm. firstly, the classified proteins method can be converted the vector features containing various information. secondly, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (smote) is utilized to deal with the classified samples. next, the light gbm method is utilized to feature reduction. meanwhile, the features can be utilized in the penultimate dense layer. therefore, the reconstructed features can be classified with the deep forest algorithm. results: in golgi_df, this method can be utilized to select the important features and identify golgi proteins. experiments show that the well-performance than the other art-of-the state methods. golgi_df as a standalone tools, all its source codes publicly available at https://github.com/baowz12345/golgidf. discussion: golgi_df employed reconstructed feature to classify the golgi proteins. such method may achieve more available features among the unirep features.",AB_0394
"introduction: drug-target interaction (dti) prediction is a key step in drug function discovery and repositioning. the emergence of large-scale heterogeneous biological networks provides an opportunity to identify drug-related target genes, which led to the development of several computational methods for dti prediction. methods: considering the limitations of conventional computational methods, a novel tool named lm-dti based on integrated information related to lncrnas and mirnas was proposed, which adopted the graph embedding (node2vec) and the network path score methods. first, lm-dti innovatively constructed a heterogeneous information network containing eight networks composed of four types of nodes (drug, target, lncrna, and mirna). next, the node2vec method was used to obtain feature vectors of drug as well as target nodes, and the path score vector of each drug-target pair was calculated using the daspfind method. finally, the feature vectors and path score vectors were merged and input into the xgboost classifier to predict potential drug-target interactions. results and discussion: the 10-fold cross validations evaluate the classification accuracies of the lm-dti. the prediction performance of lm-dti in aupr reached 0.96, which showed a significant improvement compared with those of conventional tools. the validity of lm-dti has also been verified by manually searching literature and various databases. lm-dti is scalable and computing efficient; thus representing a powerful drug relocation tool that can be accessed for free at http://www.lirmed.com:5038/lm_dti.",AB_0394
"the exploration of important biomarkers associated with cancer development is crucial for diagnosing cancer, designing therapeutic interventions, and predicting prognoses. the analysis of gene co-expression provides a systemic perspective on gene networks and can be a valuable tool for mining biomarkers. the main objective of co-expression network analysis is to discover highly synergistic sets of genes, and the most widely used method is weighted gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna). with the pearson correlation coefficient, wgcna measures gene correlation, and uses hierarchical clustering to identify gene modules. the pearson correlation coefficient reflects only the linear dependence between variables, and the main drawback of hierarchical clustering is that once two objects are clustered together, the process cannot be reversed. hence, readjusting inappropriate cluster divisions is not possible. existing co-expression network analysis methods rely on unsupervised methods that do not utilize prior biological knowledge for module delineation. here we present a method for identification of outstanding modules in a co-expression network using a knowledge-injected semi-supervised learning approach (kisl), which utilizes apriori biological knowledge and a semi-supervised clustering method to address the issue existing in the current gcn-based clustering methods. to measure the linear and non-linear dependence between genes, we introduce a distance correlation due to the complexity of the gene-gene relationship. eight rna-seq datasets of cancer samples are used to validate its effectiveness. in all eight datasets, the kisl algorithm outperformed wgcna when comparing the silhouette coefficient, calinski-harabasz index and davies-bouldin index evaluation metrics. according to the results, kisl clusters had better cluster evaluation values and better gene module aggregation. enrichment analysis of the recognition modules demonstrated their effectiveness in discovering modular structures in biological co-expression networks. in addition, as a general method, kisl can be applied to various co-expression network analyses based on similarity metrics. source codes for the kisl and the related scripts are available online at https://github.com/mowonhoo/kisl.git.",AB_0394
"background: the authors aimed to produce a prediction model for survival at any given date after surgery for esophageal cancer (conditional survival), which has not been done previously. materials and methods: using joint density functions, the authors developed and validated a prediction model for all-cause and disease-specific mortality after surgery with esophagectomy, for esophageal cancer, conditional on postsurgery survival time. the model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) and risk calibration, with internal cross-validation. the derivation cohort was a nationwide swedish population-based cohort of 1027 patients treated in 1987-2010, with follow-up throughout 2016. this validation cohort was another swedish population-based cohort of 558 patients treated in 2011-2013, with follow-up throughout 2018. results: the model predictors were age, sex, education, tumor histology, chemo(radio)therapy, tumor stage, resection margin status, and reoperation. the medians of auc after internal cross-validation in the derivation cohort were 0.74 (95% ci: 0.69-0.78) for 3-year all-cause mortality, 0.76 (95% ci: 0.72-0.79) for 5-year all-causemortality, 0.74 (95% ci: 0.70-0.78) for 3-year disease-specificmortality, and 0.75 (95% ci: 0.72-0.79) for 5-year disease-specificmortality. the corresponding auc values in the validation cohort ranged from 0.71 to 0.73. the model showed good agreement between observed and predicted risks. complete results for conditional survival any given date between 1 and 5 years of surgery are available from an interactive web-tool: https://sites.google.com/view/pcsec/home. conclusion: this novel prediction model provided accurate estimates of conditional survival any time after esophageal cancer surgery. the web-tool may help guide postoperative treatment and follow-up.",AB_0394
