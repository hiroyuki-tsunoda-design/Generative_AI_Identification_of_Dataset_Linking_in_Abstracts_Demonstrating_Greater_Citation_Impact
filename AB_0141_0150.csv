"owing to the various object types and scales, complicated backgrounds, and similar appearance between tissues in medical images, it is difficult to extract some valuable information from different medical images. in this paper, we propose a context aware network with dual-stream pyramid (canet) for medical image segmentation, which comprises a dual-stream pyramid module and an encoder-decoder module with context aware. concretely, the dual-stream pyramid captures numerous complementary features at different layers by adopting multi-resolution input versions and multi-scale convolutional units, which is conductive to learning the local detail features in various scales. the encoder-decoder module with context aware progressively concatenates semantic features of the encoder branch with high-level features of the decoder branch in an efficient manner, which aims to suppress complicated backgrounds and highlight the most attractive object in medical images. quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our canet favorably performs against 13 state-of-the-art object segmentation methods on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets. the code will be released at: https://github.com/xie-xiwang/bspc2022_canet.",AB_0015
"rapid advances in single-cell transcriptome analysis provide deeper insights into the study of tissue heterogeneity at the cellular level. unsupervised clustering can identify potential cell populations in single-cell rnasequencing (scrna-seq) data, but fail to further determine the identity of each cell. existing automatic annotation methods using scrna-seq data based on machine learning mainly use single feature set and single classifier. in view of this, we propose a weighted ensemble classification framework for cell type annotation, named scwecta, which improves the accuracy of cell type identification. scwecta uses five informative gene sets and integrates five classifiers based on soft weighted ensemble framework. and the ensemble weights are inferred through the constrained non-negative least squares. validated on multiple pairs of scrna-seq datasets, scwecta is able to accurately annotate scrna-seq data across platforms and across tissues, especially for imbalanced data containing rare cell types. moreover, scwecta outperforms other comparable methods in balancing the prediction accuracy of common cell types and the unassigned rate of non-common cell types at the same time. the source code of scwecta is freely available at https://github.com/ttren-sc/scwecta.",AB_0015
"the ground glass opacity (ggo) of the lung is one of the essential features of covid-19. the ggo in computed tomography (ct) images has various features and low-intensity contrast between the ggo and edge structures. these problems pose significant challenges for segmenting the ggo. to tackle these problems, we propose a new threshold method for accurate segmentation of ggo. specifically, we offer a framework for adjusting the threshold parameters according to the image contrast. three functions include attention mechanism threshold, contour equalization, and lung segmentation (acl). the lung is divided into three areas using the attention mechanism threshold. further, the segmentation parameters of the attention mechanism thresholds of the three parts are adaptively adjusted according to the image contrast. only the segmentation regions restricted by the lung segmentation results are retained. extensive experiments on four covid datasets show that acl can segment ggo images at low contrast well. compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the similarity dice of the acl segmentation results is improved by 8.9%, the average symmetry surface distance asd is reduced by 23%, and the required computational power flop s are only 0.09% of those of deep learning models. for ggo segmentation, acl is more lightweight, and the accuracy is higher. code will be released at https://github.com/lqs-github/acl.",AB_0015
"recently, a unified stochastic particle (usp) method [14] has been developed for the simulation of multiscale nonequilibrium gas flows. compared with the conventional stochastic particle methods, such as the direct simulation monte carlo (dsmc) method, usp can be applied with much larger time steps and cell sizes as it couples the effects of particle movements and collisions. to extend the applicability of usp to complex nonequilibrium gas flows, we develop a usp solver referred to as spartacus within the framework of sparta, which is a widely used software based on the dsmc method for the simulation of rarefied gas flows. inheriting from sparta, spartacus is parallelized with the message passing interface (mpi), and it is open-source under the gnu general public license (gpl) and released in an online repository with essential documentation, tutorial examples, and benchmark cases. to evaluate the performance of spartacus, the test cases cover from one to three dimensional flows with a wide range of the knudsen number and mach number, including couette flow, lid-driven cavity flow, hypersonic flow past a cylinder, and supersonic flow around a blunt body. the results obtained by spartacus in the rarefied and continuum regimes are in good agreement with dsmc and computational fluid dynamics (cfd) results, respectively. moreover, spartacus has significant computational efficiency advantage over traditional dsmc solvers, especially for three-dimensional nonequilibrium gas flows. in addition, spartacus shows comparable parallel efficiency with sparta, so it is promising to be applied with high performance computing for the simulation of complex multiscale gas flows encountered in engineering problems.program summaryprogram title: spartacuscpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /pyb343w7zv.1developer's repository link: https://github .com /kkfeng /spartacuslicensing provisions: gnu general public license version 2 programming language: c++external routines/libraries: sparta (http://sparta .sandia .gov/)nature of problem: multiscale simulation of nonequilibrium gas flows using unified stochastic particle method.solution method: unified stochastic particle (usp) method.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0015
"myocardial pathology segmentation (myops) can be a prerequisite for the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of myocardial infarction. however, achieving this segmentation is challenging, mainly due to the inadequate and indistinct information from an image. in this work, we develop an end-to-end deep neural network, referred to as myops-net, to flexibly combine five-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) images for myops. to extract precise and adequate information, we design an effective yet flexible architecture to extract and fuse cross-modal features. this architecture can tackle different numbers of cmr images and complex combinations of modalities, with output branches targeting specific pathologies. to impose anatomical knowledge on the segmentation results, we first propose a module to regularize myocardium consistency and localize the pathologies, and then introduce an inclusiveness loss to utilize relations between myocardial scars and edema. we evaluated the proposed myops-net on two datasets, i.e., a private one consisting of 50 paired multi-sequence cmr images and a public one from miccai2020 myops challenge. experimental results showed that myops-net could achieve state-of-the-art performance in various scenarios. note that in practical clinics, the subjects may not have full sequences, such as missing lge cmr or mapping cmr scans. we therefore conducted extensive experiments to investigate the performance of the proposed method in dealing with such complex combinations of different cmr sequences. results proved the superiority and generalizability of myops-net, and more importantly, indicated a practical clinical application. the code has been released via https://github.com/qjyball/myops-net.",AB_0015
"motivation: dna methylation within gene body and promoters in cancer cells is well documented. an increasing number of studies showed that cytosine-phosphate-guanine (cpg) sites falling within other regulatory elements could also regulate target gene activation, mainly by affecting transcription factors (tfs) binding in human cancers. this led to the urgent need for comprehensively and effectively collecting distinct cis-regulatory elements and tfbinding sites (tfbs) to annotate dna methylation regulation.results: we developed a database (canmethdb, http://meth.liclab.net/canmethdb/) that focused on the upstream and downstream annotations for cpg-genes in cancers. this included upstream cis -regulatory elements, especially those involving distal regions to genes, and tfbs annotations for the cpgs and downstream functional annotations for the target genes, computed through integrating abundant dna methylation and gene expression profiles in diverse cancers. users could inquire cpg-target gene pairs for a cancer type through inputting a genomic region, a cpg, a gene name, or select hypo/hypermethylated cpg sets. the current version of canmethdb documented a total of 38 986 060 cpg-target gene pairs (with 6 769 130 unique pairs), involving 385 217 cpgs and 18 044 target genes, abundant cis-regulatory elements and tfs for 33 tcga cancer types. canmethdb might help biologists perform indepth studies of target gene regulations based on dna methylations in cancer.availability and implementation: the main program is available at https://github.com/chunquanlipathway/canmethdb.",AB_0015
"images captured in weak illumination conditions could seriously degrade the image quality. solving a series of degradation of low-light images can effectively improve the visual quality of images and the performance of high-level visual tasks. in this study, a novel retinex-based real-low to real-normal network (r2rnet) is proposed for low-light image enhancement, which includes three subnets: a decom-net, a denoise-net, and a relight-net. these three subnets are used for decomposing, denoising, contrast enhancement and detail preservation, respectively. our r2rnet not only uses the spatial information of the image to improve the contrast but also uses the frequency information to preserve the details. therefore, our model achieved more robust results for all degraded images. unlike most previous methods that were trained on synthetic images, we collected the first large-scale real-world paired low/normal-light images dataset (lsrw dataset) to satisfy the training requirements and make our model have better generalization performance in real-world scenes. extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually. in addition, our results showed that the performance of the high-level visual task (i.e., face detection) can be effectively improved by using the enhanced results obtained by our method in low-light conditions. our codes and the lsrw dataset are available at: https://github.com/jianghaiscu/r2rnet.",AB_0015

"the subacromial impingement syndrome is a high-incidence injury for cross-country sit-skiing skier, which is often accompanied by muscle imbalance. however, at present, no musculoskeletal model has been identified for this sport. thus, this research aimed to establish a bilateral upper extremity trunk (buet) musculoskeletal model suitable for cross-country sit-skiing based on opensim software and verify the function of the model. by splicing three existing opensim models, an upper limb model with 17 segments, 35 degrees of freedom, and 472 musculotendon actuators was established. the clavicle and scapula were modeled as individual bodies and then connected to the torso through a three-degrees-of-freedom rotational joint and to the clavicle through a weld joint, respectively. the five lumbar vertebrae were established separately and coupled into a three-degree-of-freedom joint. kinematics, kinetic, and emg signal data of five 15-s maximal effort interval tests were obtained by using seven cameras, ergometers, and surface emg synchronous collection. based on the resulting rotator cuff muscle geometry of the model, simulated muscle activation patterns were comparable to experimental data, and muscle-driven ability was proven. the model will be available online (https:// simtk. org/ proje cts/ bit) for researchers to study the muscle activation of shoulder joint movement.",AB_0015
"mitosis counting of biopsies is an important biomarker for breast cancer patients, which supports disease prognostication and treatment planning. developing a robust mitotic cell detection model is highly challenging due to its complex growth pattern and high similarities with non-mitotic cells. most mitosis detection algorithms have poor generalizability across image domains and lack reproducibility and validation in multicenter settings. to overcome these issues, we propose a generalizable and robust mitosis detection algorithm (called fmdet), which is independently tested on multicenter breast histopathological images. to capture more refined morphological features of cells, we convert the object detection task as a semantic segmentation problem. the pixel-level annotations for mitotic nuclei are obtained by taking the intersection of the masks generated from a well-trained nuclear segmentation model and the bounding boxes provided by the midog 2021 challenge. in our segmentation framework, a robust feature extractor is developed to capture the appearance variations of mitotic cells, which is constructed by integrating a channel-wise multi-scale attention mechanism into a fully convolutional network structure. benefiting from the fact that the changes in the low-level spectrum do not affect the high-level semantic perception, we employ a fourier-based data augmentation method to reduce domain discrepancies by exchanging the low-frequency spectrum between two domains. our fmdet algorithm has been tested in the midog 2021 challenge and ranked first place. further, our algorithm is also externally validated on four independent datasets for mitosis detection, which exhibits state-of-the-art performance in comparison with previously published results. these results demonstrate that our algorithm has the potential to be deployed as an assistant decision support tool in clinical practice. our code has been released at https://github.com/xiyue-wang/1st-in-miccai-midog-2021-challenge.",AB_0015
