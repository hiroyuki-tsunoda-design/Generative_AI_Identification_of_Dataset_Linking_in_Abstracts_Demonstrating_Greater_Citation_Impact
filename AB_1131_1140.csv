"millions of in situ ocean temperature profiles have been collected historically using various instrument types with varying sensor accuracy and then assembled into global databases. these are essential to our current understanding of the changing state of the oceans, sea level, earth's climate, marine ecosystems and fisheries, and for constraining model projections of future change that underpin mitigation and adaptation solutions. profiles distributed shortly after collection are also widely used in operational applications such as real-time monitoring and forecasting of the ocean state and weather prediction. before use in scientific or societal service applications, quality control (qc) procedures need to be applied to flag and ultimately remove erroneous data. automatic qc (aqc) checks are vital to the timeliness of operational applications and for reducing the volume of dubious data which later require qc processing by a human for delayed mode applications. despite the large suite of evolving aqc checks developed by institutions worldwide, the most effective set of aqc checks was not known. we have developed a framework to assess the performance of aqc checks, under the auspices of the international quality controlled ocean database (iquod) project. the iquod-aqc framework is an open-source collaborative software infrastructure built in python (available from https://github.com/iquod). sixty aqc checks have been implemented in this framework. their performance was benchmarked against three reference datasets which contained a spectrum of instrument types and error modes flagged in their profiles. one of these (a subset of the quality-controlled ocean temperature archive (quota) dataset that had been manually inspected for quality issues by its creators) was also used to identify optimal sets of aqc checks. results suggest that the aqc checks are effective for most historical data, but less so in the case of data from mechanical bathythermographs (mbts), and much less effective for argo data. the optimal aqc sets will be applied to generate quality flags for the next release of the iquod dataset. this will further elevate the quality and historical value of millions of temperature profile data which have already been improved by iquod intelligent metadata and observational uncertainty information ().",AB_0114
"background: variation in tibia geometry is a risk factor for tibial stress fractures. geometric variability in bones is often quantified using statistical shape modelling. statistical shape models (ssm) offer a method to assess three-dimensional variation of structures and identify the source of variation. although ssm have been used widely to assess long bones, there is limited open-source datasets of this kind. overall, the creation of ssm can be an expensive process, that requires advanced skills. a publicly available tibia shape model would be beneficial as it enables researchers to improve skills. further, it could benefit health, sport and medicine with the potential to assess geometries suitable for medical equipment, and aid in clinical diagnosis. this study aimed to: (i) quantify tibial geometry using a ssm; and (ii) provide the ssm and associated code as an open-source dataset.methods: lower limb computed tomography (ct) scans from the right tibia -fibula of 30 cadavers (male n = 20, female n = 10) were obtained from the new mexico decedent image database. tibias were segmented and reconstructed into both cortical and trabecular sections. fibulas were segmented as a singular surface. the segmented bones were used to develop three ssm of the: (i) tibia; (ii) tibia -fibula; and (iii) cortical-trabecular. principal component analysis was applied to obtain the three ssm, with the principal components that explained 95% of geometric variation retained.results: overall size was the main source of variation in all three models accounting for 90.31%, 84.24% and 85.06%. other sources of geometric variation in the tibia surface models included overall and midshaft thickness; prominence and size of the condyle plateau, tibial tuberosity, and anterior crest; and axial torsion of the tibial shaft. further variations in the tibia -fibula model included midshaft thickness of the fibula; fibula head position relative to the tibia; tibia and fibula anterior-posterior curvature; fibula posterior curvature; tibia plateau rotation; and interosseous width. the main sources of variation in the cortical-trabecular model other than general size included variation in the medulla cavity diameter; cortical thickness; anterior-posterior shaft curvature; and the volume of trabecular bone in the proximal and distal ends of the bone.conclusion: variations that could increase the risk of tibial stress injury were observed, these included general tibial thickness, midshaft thickness, tibial length and medulla cavity diameter (indicative of cortical thickness). further research is needed to better understand the effect of these tibial -fibula shape characteristics on tibial stress and injury risk. this ssm, the associated code, and three use examples for the ssm have been provided in an open-source dataset. the developed tibial surface models and statistical shape model will be made available for use at: https://simtk. org/projects/ssm_tibia.",AB_0114
"fibroblast activation protein is highly expressed on a subset of activated fibroblasts and stellate cells at mesenchymalepithelial interfaces and is associated with macrophage infiltration. specific fibroblast activation protein inhibition modulates macrophage function, attenuates parenchymal liver fibrosis, and facilitates hepatocyte proliferation, with reduced efficacy in biliary fibrosis. background & aims: fibroblast activation protein (fap) is expressed on activated fibroblast. its role in fibrosis and des-moplasia is controversial, and data on pharmacological fap inhibition are lacking. we aimed to better define the role of fap in liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. methods: fap expression was analyzed in mice and patients with fibrotic liver diseases of various etiologies. fibrotic mice received a specific fap inhibitor (fapi) at 2 doses orally for 2 weeks during parenchymal fibrosis progression (6 weeks of carbon tetrachloride) and regression (2 weeks off carbon tet-rachloride), and with biliary fibrosis (mdr2-/-). recombinant fap was added to (co-)cultures of hepatic stellate cells (hsc), fibroblasts, and macrophages. fibrosis-and inflammation -related parameters were determined biochemically, by quan-titative immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, and transcriptomics. results: fap+ fibroblasts/hscs were a-smooth muscle actin (a-sma)-negative and located at interfaces of fibrotic septa next to macrophages in murine and human livers. in parenchymal fibrosis, fapi reduced collagen area, liver collagen content, alpha- sma+ myofibroblasts, m2-type macrophages, serum alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase, key fibrogenesis-related transcripts, and increased hepatocyte proliferation 10-fold. during regression, fap was suppressed, and fapi was ineffective. fapi less potently inhibited biliary fibrosis. in vitro, fap small interfering rna reduced hsc a-sma expression and collagen production, and fapi suppressed their activation and proliferation. compared with untreated macro-phages, fapi regulated macrophage probrogenic activation and transcriptome, and their conditioned medium attenuated hsc activation, which was increased with addition of recom-binant fap. conclusions: pharmacological fap inhibition attenuates inammation-predominant liver brosis. fap is expressed on subsets of activated broblasts/hsc and promotes both macrophage and hsc probrogenic activity in liver brosis.

"the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation (vos) has been greatly advanced and state-of-the-art performance has been made by dense matching-based methods. the recent methods leverage space-time memory (stm) networks and learn to retrieve relevant information from all available sources, where the past frames with object masks form an external memory and the current frame as the query is segmented using the mask information in the memory. however, when forming the memory and per-forming matching, these methods only exploit the appearance information while ignoring the motion information. in this paper, we advocate for the return of the motion information and propose a motion uncertainty-aware framework (munet) for semi-supervised vos. first, we propose an implicit method to learn the spatial correspondences between neighboring frames, building upon a correlation cost volume. to handle the challenging cases of occlusion and textureless regions during constructing dense corre-spondences, we incorporate the uncertainty in dense matching and achieve motion uncertainty-aware feature representation. second, we introduce a motion-aware spatial attention module to effectively fuse the motion features with the semantic features. comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that using a small amount of data and combining it with powerful motion information can bring a significant performance boost . we achieve 76 . 5% j&f only using davis17 for training2, which significantly outperforms the sota methods under the low-data protocol. the code and supplementary materials will be available at https://npucvr.github.io/munet .

"pattern recognition receptors (prrs) recognize distinct features on the surface of pathogens or damaged cells and play key roles in the innate immune system. prrs are divided into various families, including toll-like receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-i-like receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors, and c-type lectin receptors. as these are implicated in host health and several diseases, their accurate identification is indis-pensable for their functional characterization and targeted therapeutic approaches. here, we construct prr-hypred, a novel two-layer hybrid framework in which the first layer predicts whether a given sequence is prr or non-prr using a support vector machine, and in the second, the predicted prr sequence is assigned to a specific family using a random forest-based classifier. based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, prr-hypred achieved 83.4 % accuracy in the first layer and 95 % in the second, with matthew's correlation coefficient values of 0.639 and 0.816, respectively. this is the first study that can simultaneously predict and classify prrs into specific families. prr-hypred is available as a web portal at https://procarb.org/prrhypred/. we hope that it could be a valuable tool for the large-scale prediction and classification of prrs and subsequently facilitate future studies.",AB_0114

"robust learning methods aim to learn a clean target distribution from noisy and corrupted training data where a specific corruption pattern is often assumed a priori. our proposed method can not only success-fully learn the clean target distribution from a dirty dataset but also can estimate the underlying noise pattern. to this end, we leverage a mixture-of-experts model that can distinguish two different types of predictive uncertainty, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. we show that the ability to estimate the un-certainty plays a significant role in elucidating the corruption patterns as these two objectives are tightly intertwined. we also present a novel validation scheme for evaluating the performance of the corrup-tion pattern estimation. our proposed method is extensively assessed in terms of both robustness and corruption pattern estimation in the computer vision domain. code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/jeongeun980906/uncertainty-aware-robust-learning .
