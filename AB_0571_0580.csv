"prompted by the renewed interest the past decade in the hydrodynamic model for the description of nanoplasmonic systems, we present opensans, a matlab toolbox for the simulation of canonical (that is, standalone spherical and cylindrical) nanoparticles and planar stratified structures whose critical di-mensions are of mere nanometres. the method comprises of a generalisation of mie theory to properly address the hydrodynamic motion of free electrons in metals and a compact s matrix formulation for the efficient treatment of multiple layers. the toolbox is built in a modular manner; each part (routine) has its own important functionality and can be used independently from the others. our primary goal is the presentation of a highly efficient and accessible solver for the nanoplasmonics community. this is achieved by the very semi-analyticity of the chosen method and by powerful vectorisation techniques optimised in a very popular environment, matlab. program summary program title: opensans cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /hmk224xngb .1 code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /2246190 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: matlab r2018b and newer. supplementary material: see appendix a. nature of problem: solve the scattering problem from multilayered, dielectric, local or nonlocal metallic nanoparticles, excited by a plane wave and placed in a local (dielectric or metallic) background. solution method: mie theory, appropriately extended to incorporate nonlocal effects (longitudinal waves) as predicted by the hard wall-hydrodynamic model, combined with s matrix theory for efficient han-dling of the multilayered structure.

"postwrf is an open-source software toolkit to facilitate the main visualization tasks and data handling for the wrf model outputs. the toolkit is mostly written in ncl and shell, with a namelist that resembles the wrf or wps namelists. besides the visualizations, postwrf provides wrf-netcdf to geotiff conversion for gis applications, era5-netcdf reanalysis data plotting and extraction, and preparation and plotting of the rttov model inputs (from wrf) and outputs. the primary purpose of postwrf is to benefit the environmental researchers (both experienced and inexperienced) to make use of the wrf model simulations, in a straightforward and efficient way, without dealing with coding and syntax errors. since the wrf model simulates most aspects of a full atmospheric model in the regional scale, the toolkit can also be used as an educational aid in meteorological and environmental science. postwrf is freely available on github (https://github.com/anikfal/postwrf), provided with html documentations (https://postwrf.readthedocs.io/ en/master) and guided examples.",AB_0058
"we present a coarse-grained c alpha-based protein model that can be used to simulate structured, intrinsically disordered and partially disordered proteins. we use a go-like potential for the structured parts and two different variants of a transferable potential for the disordered parts. the first variant uses dynamic structure-based (dsb) contacts that form and disappear quasi-adiabatically during the simulation. by using specific structural criteria we distinguish sidechain-sidechain, sidechain-backbone and backbone -backbone contacts. the second variant is a non-radial multi-body pseudo-improper-dihedral (pid) potential that does not include time-dependent terms but requires more computational resources. our model can simulate in reasonable time thousands of residues on millisecond time scales.program summary program title: cg cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /dp7gwrs94n .1 code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /9528010 licensing provisions: mit programming language: c++ (new version), fortran (old version) nature of problem: simulations of one or more protein chains, structured, intrinsically disordered or partially disordered. calculating their equilibrium and kinetic properties in processes including but not limited to: folding, aggregation, conformational changes, formation of complexes, aggregation, response to deformation. all those processes need long simulation times or many trajectories to properly sample the system. solution method: the simulations use a molecular dynamics implicit-solvent coarse-grained model where each pseudoatom represents one amino acid residue. residues are harmonically connected to form a chain. the system evolves according to langevin dynamics. the backbone stiffness potential involves bond angle and dihedral angle terms (or a chirality term in the structured case). residues interact via modified lennard-jones or debye-hueckel potentials. the potential is different for structured and disordered parts of a protein. a go model contact map is used for the structured parts, where an interaction between two residues is attractive if effective spheres associated with their heavy atoms overlap in the native structure [1,2,3,4]. non-attractive contacts use only the repulsive part of the lennard-jones potential. the potential for the disordered parts has two versions: in the quasi-adiabatic dynamic structure-based (dsb) variant, the contacts are formed dynamically based on the structure of the chain and are quasi-adiabatically turned on and off [5,6]. in the slower, but more accurate pseudo-improper-dihedral (pid) variant the lennard-jones term is multiplied by a pseudo-improper-dihedral term that gives similar geometric restrictions with a time-independent hamiltonian [7]. proteins can be pulled by their termini to mimic stretching by an atomic force microscope [8,9]. multiple protein chains can be put in a simulation box with periodic boundary conditions or with walls that may be repulsive or attractive for the residues. the walls may move to mimic pulling or shearing deformations. the program accepts pdb files or protein sequences with optional user-defined contact maps. it saves the results in an output file (summary), a pdb file (structure) and a map file (contact map in a given snapshot). additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: the program supports openmp (effective up to 8 cores, use 4 cores for optimal speed-up). the c++ version is hosted on github, the fortran version is distributed as a .tar archive. references [1] m. sikora, j.i. sulkowska, m. cieplak, plos comput. biol. 5 (2009) e1000547.

"seven species of cornulitids, one unidentified tubicolous shell, and the problematic bryozoan lagenosypho spandel, 1898 are here described from the katian of baltica. three new species-cornulites lindae new species, cornulites meidlai new species, and conchicolites kroegeri new species-are described. the unidentified tubicolous organism has punctate shell structure and setae-like structures that can best be affiliated with lophophorates. the hirmuse fauna indicates that the diversity and number of cornulitids in the ordovician of baltica has been underestimated and it is likely that the baltic cornulitid fauna was as diverse and abundant as the fauna of laurentia. clay mud-bottom environments supported the highest cornulitid diversity in the late ordovician of baltica. the occurrence of intermediate forms indicates that some tentaculitid characters, e.g., regular annulation and a nearly straight shell, which were thought to be apomorphies of free-living tentaculitids, were actually inherited from ancestral cornulitids. the cornulitid fauna of the late ordovician of laurentia somewhat resembles the cornulitid fauna of the late ordovician of baltica, but there are fewer common faunal elements between gondwana and baltica.uuid: http://zoobank.org/cc704237-b578-4d06-a8ed-8457ca3ce972",AB_0058
"we propose region-wise (rw) loss for biomedical image segmentation. region-wise loss is versatile, can simultaneously account for class imbalance and pixel importance, and it can be easily implemented as the pixel-wise multiplication between the softmax output and a rw map. we show that, under the proposed rw loss framework, certain loss functions, such as active contour and boundary loss, can be reformulated similarly with appropriate rw maps, thus revealing their underlying similarities and a new perspective to understand these loss functions. we investigate the observed optimization instability caused by certain rw maps, such as boundary loss distance maps, and we introduce a mathematically-grounded principle to avoid such instability. this principle provides excellent adaptability to any dataset and practically ensures convergence without extra regularization terms or optimization tricks. following this principle, we propose a simple version of boundary distance maps called rectified region-wise (rrw) maps that, as we demonstrate in our experiments, achieve state-of-the-art performance with similar or better dice coefficients and hausdorff distances than dice, focal, weighted cross entropy, and boundary losses in three distinct segmentation tasks. we quantify the optimization instability provided by boundary loss distance maps, and we empirically show that our rrw maps are stable to optimize. the code to run all our experiments is publicly available at: https://github.com/jmlipman/regionwiseloss .

"in this study, we propose a novel approach to predict the distances of the detected objects in an observed scene. the proposed approach modifies the recently proposed convolutional support estimator networks (csens). csens are designed to compute a direct mapping for the support estimation (se) task in a representation-based classification problem. we further propose and demonstrate that representation-based methods (sparse or collaborative representation) can be used in well-designed regression problems especially over scarce data. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first representation-based method proposed for performing a regression task by utilizing the modified csens; and hence, we name this novel approach as representation-based regression (rbr). the initial version of csens has a proxy mapping stage (i.e., a coarse estimation for the support set) that is required for the input. in this study, we improve the csen model by proposing compressive learning csen (cl-csen) that has the ability to jointly optimize the so-called proxy mapping stage along with convolutional layers. the experimental evaluations using the kitti 3d object detection distance estimation dataset show that the proposed method can achieve a significantly improved distance estimation performance over all competing methods. finally, the software implementations of the methods are publicly shared at https://github.com/meteahishali/csendistance.(c) 2022 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd.",AB_0058

"purpose the determination of which amino acid in a protein interacts with other proteins is important in understanding the functional mechanism of that protein. although there are experimental methods to detect protein-protein interaction sites (ppiss), these are costly, time-consuming, and require expertise. therefore, many computational methods have been proposed to accelerate this type of research, but they are generally insufficient to predict ppiss accurately. there is a need for development in this field. methods in this study, we introduce a new ppiss prediction method. this method is a sequence-based stacking ensemble deep (sensdeep) learning method that has an ensemble learning model including the models of rnn, cnn, gru sequence to sequence (grus2s), gru sequence to sequence with an attention layer (grus2satt) and a multilayer perceptron. two embedded features, secondary structure, and protein sequence information are added to the training data set in addition to twelve existing features to improve the prediction performance of the method. results sensdeep trained on the training data set without two extra features obtains a better performance on some of the independent testing data sets than that of the other methods in the literature, especially on scoring metrics of sensitivity, f1, mcc, and auprc, having increments up to 63.5%, 19.3%, 18.5%, 11.4%, respectively. it is shown that the added extra features improve the performance of the method by having almost the same performance with less data as the method trained on the data set without these added features. on the other hand, different sizes of the sliding window are tried on the data sets and an optimal sliding window size for sensdeep is found. moreover, sensdeep has also been compared to structure-based methods. some of these methods have been found to perform better. using sensdeep obtained by training with both training data sets, ppiss prediction examples of various proteins that are not in these training data sets are also presented. furthermore, execution times for sensdeep and its submodels are shown. availability and implementation https://github.com/enginaybey/sensdeep",AB_0058
"the reliable control of wave energy devices highly relies on the forecasts of wave heights. however, the dynamic characteristics and significant fluctuation of waves' historical data pose challenges to precise predictions. neural networks offer a promising solution to forecast the wave heights by extracting meaningful features from historical observations. this paper proposes a novel hybrid random vector functional link network with the ensemble and deep learning benefits. hierarchical stacks of hidden layers are constructed to enforce the deep representations of the time series. individual output layers follow all enhancement layers to adopt ensemble learning. a neuron pruning strategy is proposed to remove the noisy information from the random features and boost the network's performance. besides, the proposed network is further utilized to forecast the additive and multiplicative residuals from the arima method. finally, the ensemble of additive-arima-edrvfl, multiplicative-arima-edrvfl, and edrvfl achieves the best average rankings around two for three forecasting horizons. the proposed ensemble achieves an average ranking of 1.33 on four-hours ahead of forecasting in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute scaled error. extensive experiments are conducted on twelve time series of the significant wave height. the comparative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over other state-of-the-art methods. the source codes are available on https://github.com/p-n-suganthan/codes.",AB_0058
