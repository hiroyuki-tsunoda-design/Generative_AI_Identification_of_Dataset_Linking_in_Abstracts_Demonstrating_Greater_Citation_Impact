"post-translational modifications (ptms) are one of the compulsive and predominant biological processes that regulate the diverse molecular mechanism, modulate the onset of disease, and are the reason behind the functional diversity of proteins. despite the widespread research findings in neuroproteomics, one of the key drawbacks has been the lack of proteome-level knowledge of hemispheric lateralization. we have investigated the proteome level expression in different neuroanatomical regions under the human brain proteome project (hbpp) and developed the global interhemispheric brain proteome map (brainprot) earlier. furthermore, this study has extended to decipher the phosphoproteome map of human brain interhemispheric regions through high-resolution mass spectrometry. the phosphoproteomics examination of 12 unique interhemispheric neurological brain regions using orbitrap fusion liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry provided comprehensive coverage of 996 phosphoproteins, 2010 phosphopeptides, and 3567 phosphosites. moreover, interhemispheric phosphoproteome profiling has been categorized according to synaptic ontologies and interhemispheric expression to understand the functionality. finally, we have integrated the phosphosites data under the phosphomap section in the inter-hemispheric brain proteome map portal (https:// www.brainprot.org/) for the advancement and support of the ongoing neuroproteomics research worldwide. data is available via proteomexchange with the identifier pxd031188.",AB_0050
"upstream open reading frames (uorfs) are initiated by aug or near-cognate start codons and have been identified in the transcript leader sequences of the majority of eukaryotic transcripts. functionally, uorfs are implicated in downstream translational regulation of the main protein coding sequence and may serve as a source of non-canonical peptides. genetic defects in uorf sequences have been linked to the development of various diseases, including cancer. to simplify uorf-related research, the initial release of uorfdb in 2014 provided a comprehensive and manually curated collection of uorf-related literature. here, we present an updated sequence-based version of uorfdb, accessible at https://www.bioinformatics.uni-muenster.de/tools/uorfdb. the new uorfdb enables users to directly access sequence information, graphical displays, and genetic variation data for over 2.4 million human uorfs. it also includes sequence data of >4.2 million uorfs in 12 additional species. multiple uorfs can be displayed in transcript- and reading-frame-specific models to visualize the translational context. a variety of filters, sequence-related information, and links to external resources (ucsc genome browser, dbsnp, clinvar) facilitate immediate in-depth analysis of individual uorfs. the database also contains uorf-related somatic variation data obtained from whole-genome sequencing (wgs) analyses of 677 cancer samples collected by the tcga consortium.",AB_0050
"approximations with matlab implementations for the relativistic fermi-dirac integral and its partial derivatives are given in this paper. as the numerical tests show, the expansions allow to calculate the functions efficiently and with high accuracy for a large range of parameters. therefore, our algorithms are expected to be a very useful tool, in combination with other methods, for building reliable and efficient software for computing the functions for all the parameters ranges. program summary program title: fermidiracexpans cpc library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/sk34wtcxhh.1 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: matlab nature of problem: the evaluation of the relativistic fermi-dirac function and its partial derivatives is needed in different problems in applied and theoretical physics, such as stellar astrophysics, plasma physics or electronics. solution method: convergent and asymptotic expansions are provided to approximate the relativistic fermi-dirac function and its derivatives for moderate/large values of its parameters. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: the functions work in recent versions of matlab (from version r2014b on).

"a significant fraction of mature mirna transcripts carries sequence and/or length variations, termed isomirs. isomirs are differentially abundant in cell types, tissues, body fluids or patients' samples. not surprisingly, multiple studies describe a physiological and pathophysiological role. despite their importance, systematically collected and annotated isomir information available in databases remains limited. we thus developed isomirdb, a comprehensive resource that compiles mirna expression data at isomir resolution from various sources. we processed 42 499 human mirna-seq datasets (5.9 x 10(11) sequencing reads) and consistently analyzed them using mirmaster and srnabench. our database provides online access to the 90 483 most abundant isomirs (>1 rpm in at least 1% of the samples) from 52 tissues and 188 cell types. additionally, the full set of over 3 million detected isomirs is available for download. our resource can be queried at the sample, mirna or isomir level so users can quickly answer common questions about the presence/absence of a particular mirna/isomir in tissues of interest. further, the database facilitates to identify whether a potentially interesting new isoform has been detected before and its frequency. in addition to expression tables, isomirdb can generate multiple interactive visualisations including violin plots and heatmaps. isomirdb is free to use and publicly available at: https://www.ccb.uni-saarland. de/isomirdb.",AB_0050
"a modern fortran implementation of three dirac operators (wilson, brillouin, susskind) in lattice qcd is presented, based on openmp shared-memory parallelization and simd pragmas. the main idea is to apply a dirac operator to nv vectors simultaneously, to ease the memory bandwidth bottleneck. all index computations are left to the compiler and maximum weight is given to portability and flexibility. the lattice volume, nxnynznt, the number of colors, nc, and the number of right-hand sides, nv, are parameters defined at compile time. several memory layout options are compared. the code performs well on modern many-core architectures (480 gflop/s, 880 gflop/s, and 780 gflop/s with nv = 12 for the three operators in single precision on a 72-core knl processor, a 2 x 24-core skylake node yields similar results). explicit run-time tests with cg/bicgstab inverters confirm that the memory layout is relevant for the knl, but less so for the skylake architecture. the ancillary code distribution contains all routines, including the single, double, and mixed precision krylov space solvers, to render it self-contained and ready-to-use.program summaryprogram title: testknl_main.f90cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /7km9wcspn3 .1licensing provisions: creative commons by 4.0programming language: fortran 2008supplementary material: detailed description of each module of the code distribution. nature of problem: solving the dirac equation du = b for three choices of the dirac operator d relevant to lattice qcd. the choices are known as wilson fermions, brillouin fermions and susskind or staggered fermions, respectively.solution method: standard solution through sparse iterative solvers cg and bicgstab, albeit with several right-hand vectors packed into a right-hand matrix. the number of colors, nc, the number of right-hand sides, nv, and the box lengths, nx, ny, nz and nt, can be chosen freely.additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: the code allows the user to compare several memory layout options for the block of right-hand sides, that is several orderings of the slots pertinent to nc, nv and possibly the dirac spinor, in the array representation of u and b. no machine dependent optimizations are used, only standard openmp shared-memory parallelization and simd pragmas are used.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0050
"the lisbon kinetics monte carlo (loki-mc) is an open-source simulation tool that solves the electron kinetics for low-temperature plasmas excited by uniform dc electric fields from different gas mixtures, using monte carlo techniques. following the strategy and data organization of the lisbon kinetics boltzmann (loki-b) solver, the program easily addresses any complex mixture of atomic/molecular species, describing electron collisions with any target state (electronic, vibrational and rotational), characterized by any user-prescribed population. loki-mc is written in c++, benefiting from a highly -efficient object-oriented structure. on input, the code requires the working conditions, the gas-mixture composition, the distributions of populations for the levels of the atomic/molecular gases considered, and the relevant sets of electron-scattering cross sections obtained from the open-access website lxcat. on output, it yields the electron energy and velocity distribution functions, the electron swarm parameters, the collision rate-coefficients, and the electron power absorbed from the electric field and transferred to the different collisional channels. this paper presents loki-mc and gives examples of results obtained for different model and real gases, verifying and benchmarking the simulation tool against analytical solutions and other available codes, and assesses its computational performance. moreover, the effects of the gas temperature, anisotropic ionization scattering (induced by momentum conservation) and superelastic collisions are analyzed in real gases.program summaryprogram title: loki-mccpclibrary link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /n7t6ctp2st .1developer's repository link: https://github .com /ist-lisbon /loki-mclicensing provisions: gplv3programming language: c++17nature of problem: simulation of the electron kinetics in non-equilibrium low-temperature plasmas, excited from arbitrarily complex gas-mixtures, under static and uniform electric fields. solution method: monte carlo sampling techniques.(c) 2022 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0050
"prior knowledge of perturbation data can significantly assist in inferring the relationship between chemical perturbations and their specific transcriptional response. however, current databases mostly contain cancer cell lines, which are unsuitable for the aforementioned inference in non-cancer cells, such as cells related to non-cancer disease, immunology and aging. here, we present chempert (https://chempert.uni.lu/), a database consisting of 82 270 transcriptional signatures in response to 2566 unique perturbagens (drugs, small molecules and protein ligands) across 167 non-cancer cell types, as well as the protein targets of 57 818 perturbagens. in addition, we develop a computational tool that leverages the non-cancer cell datasets, which enables more accurate predictions of perturbation responses and drugs in non-cancer cells compared to those based onto cancer databases. in particular, chempert correctly predicted drug effects for treating hepatitis and novel drugs for osteoarthritis. the chempert web interface is user-friendly and allows easy access of the entire datasets and the computational tool, providing valuable resources for both experimental researchers who wish to find datasets relevant to their research and computational researchers who need comprehensive non-cancer perturbation transcriptomics datasets for developing novel algorithms. overall, chempert will facilitate future in silico compound screening for non-cancer cells.",AB_0050

"diagnosis of depression using electroencephalography (eeg) is an emerging field of study. when mental health facilities are unavailable, the use of eeg as an objective measure for depression management at an individual level becomes necessary. however, the limited availability of the openly accessible eeg datasets for depression and the non-standard task paradigm confine the scope of the research. this study contributes to the area by presenting a dataset that includes eeg data of subjects in the resting state and patient health questionnaire (phq)-9 scores. these recordings incorporate eeg signals under both eyes open (eo) and eyes closed (ec) conditions. moreover, this work documents high performance on various benchmark depression classification tasks with the help of traditional supervised machine learning algorithms, namely decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbours, naive bayes, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, and extreme gradient boosted trees (xgboost) using the newly created dataset, where the class label of each patient is determined by the phq-9 score of the person. then, feature selection is performed on twenty-three linear, nonlinear, time domain, and frequency domain features using anova test and correlation analysis to identify statistically significant features, which are further fed into algorithms mentioned above separately for distinguishing healthy subjects from depressed. among these classifiers, the performance of the xgboost is found to be the best, with an accuracy of 87% for the eo state. the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms fourteen existing approaches. the dataset presented in this work can be downloaded via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1anuc-6hq02qg728zwv2a1uwtlubrrq y?usp=sharing.",AB_0050
