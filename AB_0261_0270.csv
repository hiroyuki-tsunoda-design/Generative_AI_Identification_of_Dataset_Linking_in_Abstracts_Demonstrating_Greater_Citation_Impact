"identifying protein thermodynamic stability changes upon single-point variants is crucial for studying mutation-induced alterations in protein biophysics, genomic variants, and mutation-related diseases. in the last decade, various computational methods have been developed to predict the effects of single-point variants, but the prediction accuracy is still far from satisfactory for practical applications. herein, we review approaches and tools for predicting stability changes upon the single-point variant. most of these methods require tertiary protein structure as input to achieve reliable predictions. however, the availability of protein structures limits the immediate application of these tools. to improve the performance of a computational prediction from a protein sequence without experimental structural information, we introduce a new computational framework: mu3dsp. this method assesses the effects of single-point variants on protein thermodynamic stability based on point mutated protein 3d structure profile. given a protein sequence with a single variant as input, mu3dsp integrates both sequence-level features and averaged features of 3d structures obtained from sequence alignment to pdb to assess the change of thermodynamic stability induced by the substitution. mu3dsp outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks, making it a reliable tool to assess both somatic and germline substitution variants and assist in protein design. mu3dsp is available as an open-source tool at https://github.com/hurraygong/mu3dsp.

"graph neural networks based on deep learning methods have been extensively applied to the molecular property prediction because of its powerful feature learning ability and good performance. however, most of them are black boxes and cannot give the reasonable explanation about the underlying prediction mechanisms, which seriously reduce people's trust on the neural network -based prediction models. here we proposed a novel graph neural network named iteratively focused graph network (ifgn), which can gradually identify the key atoms/groups in the molecule that are closely related to the predicted properties by the multistep focus mechanism. at the same time, the combination of the multistep focus mechanism with visualization can also generate multistep interpretations, thus allowing us to gain a deep understanding of the predictive behaviors of the model. for all studied eight datasets, the ifgn model achieved good prediction performance, indicating that the proposed multistep focus mechanism also can improve the performance of the model obviously besides increasing the interpretability of built model. for researchers to use conveniently, the corresponding website (http:// graphadmet.cniworkstifgn) was also developed and can be used free of charge.",AB_0027
"marine oil spills can cause severe damage to the marine environment and biological resources. using satellite remote sensing technology is one of the best ways to monitor the sea surface in near real-time to obtain oil spill information. the existing methods in the literature either use deep convolutional neural networks in synthetic aperture radar (sar) images to directly identify oil spills or use traditional methods based on artificial features sequentially to distinguish oil spills from sea surface. however, both approaches currently only use image information and ignore some valuable auxiliary information, such as marine weather conditions, distances from oil spill candidates to oil spill sources, etc. in this study, we proposed a novel method to help detect marine oil spills by constructing a multi-source knowledge graph, which was the first one specifically designed for oil spill detection in the remote sensing field. our method can rationally organize and utilize various oil spill-related information obtained from multiple data sources, such as remote sensing images, vectors, texts, and atmosphere-ocean model data, which can be stored in a graph database for user-friendly query and management. in order to identify oil spills more effectively, we also proposed 13 new dark spot features and then used a feature selection technique to create a feature subset that was favorable to oil spill detection. furthermore, we proposed a knowledge graph-based oil spill reasoning method that combines rule inference and graph neural network technology, which pre-inferred and eliminated most non-oil spills using statistical rules to alleviate the problem of imbalanced data categories (oil slick and non-oil slick). entity recognition is ultimately performed on the remaining oil spill candidates using a graph neural network algorithm. to verify the effectiveness of our knowledge graph approach, we collected 35 large sar images to construct a new dataset, for which the training set contained 110 oil slicks and 66264 non-oil slicks from 18 sar images, the validation set contained 35 oil slicks and 69005 non-oil slicks from 10 sar images, and the testing set contained 36 oil slicks and 36281 non-oil slicks from the remaining 7 sar images. the results showed that some traditional oil spill detection methods and deep learning models failed when the dataset suffered a severe imbalance, while our proposed method identified oil spills with a sensitivity of 0.8428, specificity of 0.9985, and precision of 0.2781 under those same conditions. the knowledge graph method we proposed using multi -source data can not only help solve the problem of information island in oil spill detection, but serve as a guide for construction of remote sensing knowledge graphs in many other applications as well. the dataset gathered has been made freely available online (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ddaqiljhjsmeuhyaatdiya?pwd=qmt6).",AB_0027
"it has been a long-standing goal in natural language processing (nlp) to learn a general lin-guistic intelligence model that can perform well on many different nlp tasks continually evolving over time while avoiding revisiting all previous data at each stage. most existing deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when dealing with sequential tasks in an incremental way, leading to dramatic performance degradation due to the miss-ing training data of old tasks. in this paper, we propose a lifelong language method with adaptive uncertainty regularization (laur), which can adapt a single bert model to work with continuously arriving text examples from different nlp tasks. specifically, laur is built on the bayesian online learning framework, and three uncertainty regularization terms are devised to collaboratively control the parameters so as to resolve the stability -plasticity dilemma in lifelong language learning. the previous posterior constrain param-eters that strongly determine the output results, preventing these parameters from chang-ing drastically, while other parameters are encouraged to be updated over time. in addition, we propose a task-specific residual adaptation module in parallel to each layer of bert to endow laur with the capacity to learn better task-specific knowledge. this con-figuration makes laur less prone to losing the knowledge stored in the base bert network when learning a new task. experimental results show that laur outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning models on a variety of nlp tasks. for reproducibility, we submit the code and data at:https://github.com/kiujhytgtrfd2021/laur.(c) 2022 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0027
"many deep learning approaches make extensive use of backbone networks pretrained on large datasets like imagenet, which are then fine-tuned. in remote sensing, the lack of comparable large annotated datasets and the diversity of sensing platforms impedes similar developments. in order to contribute towards the availability of pretrained backbone networks in remote sensing, we devise a self-supervised approach for pretraining deep neural networks. by exploiting the correspondence between co-located imagery and audio recordings, this is done completely label-free, without the need for manual annotation. for this purpose, we introduce the soundingearth dataset, which consists of co-located aerial imagery and crowd-sourced audio samples all around the world. using this dataset, we then pretrain resnet models to map samples from both modalities into a common embedding space, encouraging the models to understand key properties of a scene that influence both visual and auditory appearance. to validate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we evaluate the transfer learning performance of pretrained weights obtained against weights obtained through other means. by fine-tuning the models on a number of commonly used remote sensing datasets, we show that our approach outperforms existing pretraining strategies for remote sensing imagery. the dataset, code and pretrained model weights are available at https://github.com/khdlr/soundingearth.",AB_0027
"circular rnas (circrnas) are reverse -spliced and covalently closed rnas. their interactions with rna -binding proteins (rbps) have multiple effects on the progress of many diseases. some computational methods are proposed to identify rbp binding sites on circrnas but suffer from insufficient accuracy, robustness and explanation. in this study, we first take the characteristics of both rna and rbp into consideration. we propose a method for discriminating circrna-rbp binding sites based on multi -scale characterizing sequence and structure features, called crmss. for circrnas, we use sequence k-mer embedding and the forming probabilities of local secondary structures as features. for rbps, we combine sequence and structure frequencies of rna -binding domain regions to generate features. we capture binding patterns with multi -scale residual blocks. with bilstm and attention mechanism, we obtain the contextual information of high-level representation for circrna-rbp binding. to validate the effectiveness of crmss, we compare its predictive performance with other methods on 37 rbps. taking the properties of both circrnas and rbps into account, crmss achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. in the case study, our model provides reliable predictions and correctly identifies experimentally verified circrna-rbp pairs. the code of crmss is freely available at https://github.com/bioinformaticscsu/crmss.",AB_0027
"the recently reported machine learning- or deep learning -based scoring functions (sfs) have shown exciting performance in predicting protein-ligand binding affinities with fruitful application prospects. however, the differentiation between highly similar ligand conformations, including the native binding pose (the global energy minimum state), remains challenging that could greatly enhance the docking. in this work, we propose a fully differentiable, end -to -end framework for ligand pose optimization based on a hybrid sf called deeprmsd+vina combined with a multi -layer perceptron (deeprmsd) and the traditional autodock vina se the deeprmsd+vina, which combines (1) the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the docking pose with respect to the native pose and (2) the autodock vina score, is fully differentiable; thus is capable of optimizing the ligand binding pose to the energy -lowest conformation. evaluated by the casf-2016 docking power dataset, the deeprmsd+vina reaches a success rate of 94.4%, which outperforms most reported sfs to date. we evaluated the ligand conformation optimization framework in practical molecular docking scenarios (redocking and cross docking tasks), revealing the high potentialities of this framework in drug design and discovery. structural analysis shows that this framework has the ability to identify key physical interactions in protein-ligand binding, such as hydrogen -bonding. our work provides a paradigm for optimizing ligand conformations based on deep learning algorithms. the deeprmsd+vina model and the optimization framework are available at github repository https://github.comizchwang/deeprmsd-vina_optimization.",AB_0027
"crispr-mediated epigenome editing enables gene expression regulation without changing the underlying dna sequence, and thus has vast potential for basic research and gene therapy. effective selection of a single guide rna (sgrna) with high on-target efficiency and specificity would facilitate the application of epigenome editing tools. here we performed an extensive analysis of crispr-mediated epigenome editing tools on thousands of experimentally examined on-target sites and established epicas-dl, a deep learning framework to optimize sgrna design for gene silencing or activation. epicas-dl achieves high accuracy in sgrna activity prediction for targeted gene silencing or activation and outperforms other available in silico methods. in addition, epicas-dl also identifies both epigenetic and sequence features that affect sgrna efficacy in gene silencing and activation, facilitating the application of epigenome editing for research and therapy. epicas-dl is available at http://www.sunlab.fun:3838/epicas-dl.

"robust, reliable quantification of large sample cohorts is often essential for meaningful clinical or pharmaceutical proteomics investigations, but it is technically challenging. when analyzing very large numbers of samples, isotope labeling approaches may suffer from substantial batch effects, and even with label-free methods, it becomes evident that low-abundance proteins are not reliably measured owing to unsufficient reproducibility for quantification. the ms1-based quantitative proteomics pipeline ionstar was designed to address these challenges. ionstar is a label-free approach that takes advantage of the high sensitivity/selectivity attainable by ultrahigh-resolution (uhr)-ms1 acquisition (e.g., 120-240k full width at half maximum at m/z = 200) which is now widely available on ultrahigh -field orbitrap instruments. by selectively and accurately procuring quantitative features of peptides within precisely defined, very narrow m/z windows corresponding to the uhr-ms1 resolution, the method minimizes co-eluted interferences and substantially enhances signal-to-noise ratio of low-abundance species by decreasing noise level. this feature results in high sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy and precision for quantification of low-abundance proteins, as well as fewer missing data and fewer false positives. this protocol also emphasizes the importance of well-controlled, robust experimental procedures to achieve high-quality quantification across a large cohort. it includes a surfactant cocktail-aided sample preparation procedure that achieves high/reproducible protein/peptide recoveries among many samples, and a trapping nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry strategy for sensitive and reproducible acquisition of uhr-ms1 peptide signal robustly across a large cohort. data processing and quality evaluation are illustrated using an example dataset (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org), and example results from pharmaceutical project and one clinical project (patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome) are shown. the complete ionstar pipeline takes-1-2 weeks for a sample cohort containing-50-100 samples.",AB_0027
