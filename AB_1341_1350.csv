"background: this study aimed to explore the effect of mifepristone pretreatment on stress response and sex hormone levels after combined laparoscopic treatment for cesarean scar pregnancy. methods: we conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study from january 2020 to september 2022. a total of 98 pregnant women with cesarean scar pregnancy were included and divided into two groups by the random number table method. the control group received hysteroscopy combined with laparoscopy treatment, and the observation group received mifepristone pretreatment before hysteroscopy, combined with laparoscopy treatment. the surgical efficacy, surgical indices, menstrual recovery time, postoperative residual muscle layer, and scar morphology were observed and evaluated. the ovarian hemodynamic indices, stress indices, and sex hormone levels were measured, and the incidence of complications such as postoperative infection and liver function impairment was calculated. results: there was no significant difference in the surgical success rate between the two groups (97.96% vs 95.92%), as well as the thickness and proportion of residual muscle layer, the width, length, and depth of scars, and the incidence of postoperative complications (p > 0.05). combined mifepristone pretreatment reduced intraoperative bleeding, shortened the average time for beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hcg) to fall to negative (20.5 days, p < 0.05) and vaginal bleeding (19.8 days, p < 0.05), lowered vmax (49.8 cm/s, p < 0.05), and elevated resistance index (ri) (0.7, p < 0.05) and pulsatility index (pi) (2.5, p < 0.05). moreover, combined mifepristone pretreatment reduced c-reactive protein (crp: 8.1 mg/l, p < 0.05), cortisol (cor: 21.7 mg/l, p < 0.05), adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth: 40.2 ng/l, p < 0.05), as well as progesterone (p: 10.2 mmol/l, p < 0.05), luteinizing hormone (lh: 13.2 mu g/l, p < 0.05), and follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh: 14.8 mu g/l, p < 0.05). combined mifepristone pretreatment promoted the recovery of menstruation (25 days, p < 0.05). conclusion: mifepristone pretreatment can promote postoperative recovery, reduce postoperative stress response, improve hemodynamics, regulate sex hormone levels, and promote the early recovery of menstruation in patients with cesarean scar pregnancy. clinical trial registration: the study was registered at chinese clinical trial registry (https://www.chictr.org.cn), registration number: chictr1800015514.",AB_0135
"leaf area index (lai) with an explicit biophysical meaning is a critical variable to characterize terrestrial ecosystems. long-term global datasets of lai have served as fundamental data support for monitoring vegetation dynamics and exploring its interactions with other earth components. however, current lai products face several limitations associated with spatiotemporal consistency. in this study, we employed the back propagation neural network (bpnn) and a data consolidation method to generate a new version of the half-month 1/12(degrees) global inventory modeling and mapping studies (gimms) lai product, i.e., gimms lai4g, for the period 1982-2020. the significance of the gimms lai4g was the use of the latest pku gimms normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) product and 3.6 million high-quality global landsat lai samples to remove the effects of satellite orbital drift and sensor degradation and to develop spatiotemporally consistent bpnn models. the results showed that the gimms lai4g exhibited overall higher accuracy and lower underestimation than its predecessor (gimms lai3g) and two mainstream lai products (global land surface satellite (glass) lai and long-term global mapping (globmap) lai) using field lai measurements and landsat lai samples. its validation against landsat lai samples revealed an r-2 of 0.96, root mean square error of 0.32 m(2) m(-2), mean absolute error of 0.16 m(2) m(-2), and mean absolute percentage error of 13.6 % which meets the accuracy target proposed by the global climate observation system. it outperformed other lai products for most vegetation biomes in a majority area of the land. it efficiently eliminated the effects of satellite orbital drift and sensor degradation and presented a better temporal consistency before and after the year 2000. the consolidation with the reprocessed modis lai allows the gimms lai4g to extend the temporal coverage from 2015 to a recent period (2020), producing the lai trend that maintains high consistency before and after 2000 and aligns with the reprocessed modis lai trend during the modis era. the gimms lai4g product could potentially facilitate mitigating the disagreements between studies of the long-term global vegetation changes and could also benefit the model development in earth and environmental sciences. the gimms lai4g product is open access and available under attribution 4.0 international at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7649107 (cao et al., 2023).",AB_0135
"it is important to identify disease-associated genes for studying the pathogenic mechanism of complex diseases. recently, models for disease gene prediction are dominantly based on molecular expression data and networks, including gene expression, protein expression, co-expression networks, protein-protein interaction networks, etc. one limitation of these methods is that they do not consider the knowledge of annotated gene sets representing known pathways or functionally-related sets of genes. in this study, we propose a new approach to predict disease-associated genes by integrating annotated gene sets data from the molecular signature database (msigdb). it first represents and integrates the different types of annotated gene sets in the msigdb database in the form of the signal matrix. it then uses the signal matrix as the gene feature to train the disease gene prediction model. we compare our method with existing methods in predicting genes for five complex diseases. the results show that our method is superior to other methods. further, we perform a case study on autism spectrum disorder (asd). we find that asd predictions are associated with asd based on the statistical analysis of biological networks and independent asd studies. the source code, prediction results and datasets are publicly available on https://github.com/genemine/gsi.git.",AB_0135
"with the advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies such as illumina, pacbio, and 10x genomics platforms, and gas/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, large volumes of biological data in multiple formats can now be obtained through multi-omics analysis. bioinformatics is constantly evolving and seeking breakthroughs to solve multi-omics problems; however, it is challenging for most experimental biologists to analyse data using command-line interfaces, coding, and scripting. based on experience with multi-omics, we have developed omicssuite, a desktop suite that comprehensively integrates statistics and multi-omics analysis and visualization. the suite has 175 sub-applications in 12 categories, including sequence, statistics, algorithm, genomics, transcriptomics, enrichment, proteomics, metabolomics, clinical, microorganism, single cell, and table operation. we created the user interface with sequence view, table view, and intelligent components based on javafx and the popular shiny framework. the multi-omics analysis functions were developed based on biojava and 300+ packages provided by the r cran and bioconductor communities, and it encompasses over 3000 adjustable parameter interfaces. omicssuite can directly read multi-omics raw data in fasta, fastq, mutation annotation format, mzml, matrix, and hdf5 formats, and the programs emphasize data transfer directions and pipeline analysis functions. omicssuite can produce pre-publication images and tables, allowing users to focus on biological aspects. omicssuite offers multi-omics step-by-step workflows that can be easily applied to horticultural plant breeding and molecular mechanism studies in plants. it enables researchers to freely explore the molecular information contained in multi-omics big data (source: https://github.com/omicssuite/, website: https://omicssuite.github.io, v1.3.9).",AB_0135
"simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) systems are proposed to estimate mobile robot' poses and reconstruct maps of surrounding environments. most slam systems assume that their working environments are static. however, there are many dynamic objects in actual environments, which reduce the accuracy and robustness of the slam system. in this article, a real-time robust visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vslam) system working in dynamic environments named combine object detection, epipolar geometry constraint, and blur filtering (coeb-slam) is proposed, which combines object detection, epipolar geometry constraint, and blur filtering to remove dynamic feature points. in reality, shooting fast-moving objects can cause image motion blur, which affects the dynamic slam's ability to determine the object's state. therefore, we attempted to use the blurring level as a constraint to identify dynamic objects. moreover, the removal of a large number of feature points can lead to the failure of tracking. thus, we use a feature points redistribution method for retaining enough high-quality static features to reduce this impact. extensive evaluations in the public tum rgb-d datasets and the real-world dynamic environments demonstrate that coeb-slam has robustness in dynamic environments. compared to the orb-slam2 system, coeb-slam reduces the average absolute trajectory error by about 90% in tum rgb-d datasets. for the benefit of community, we make public the source code at https://github.com/biscuitzb/coebslam.",AB_0135
"the co-salient object detection (co-sod) aims to discover common, salient objects from a group of images. with the development of convolutional neural networks, the performance of co-sod methods has been significantly improved. however, some models cannot construct collaborative relationships across images optimally and lack effective retention of collaborative features in the top-down decoding process. in this paper, we propose a novel group attention retention network (garnet), which captures excellent collaborative features and retains them. first, a group attention module is designed to construct the inter-image relationships. second, an attention retention module and a spatial attention module are designed to retain inter-image relationships for protecting them from being diluted and filter out the cluttered context during feature fusion, respectively. finally, considering the intra-group consistency and inter-group separability of images, an embedding loss is additionally designed to discriminate between real collaborative objects and distracting objects. the experiments on four datasets (icoseg, cosal2015, cosod3k, and coca) show that our garnet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. the source code is available at https://github.com/tjummg/garnet.",AB_0135
"in feature selection research, simultaneous multi-class feature selection technologies are popular because they simultaneously select informative features for all classes. recursive feature elimination (rfe) methods are state-of-the-art binary feature selection algorithms. however, extending existing rfe algorithms to multi-class tasks may increase the computational cost and lead to performance degradation. with this motivation, we introduce a unified multi-class feature selection (ufs) framework for randomization-based neural networks to address these challenges. first, we propose a new multi-class feature ranking criterion using the output weights of neural networks. the heuristic underlying this criterion is that the importance of a feature should be related to the magnitude of the output weights of a neural network. subsequently, the ufs framework utilizes the original features to construct a training model based on a randomization-based neural network, ranks these features by the criterion of the norm of the output weights, and recursively removes a feature with the lowest ranking score. extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets suggest that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. the code of ufs is available at https://github.com/svmrelated/ufs.git.",AB_0135
"background: the role of bacterial translocation in crohn's disease has been extensively studied. however, data regarding bacterial translocation into the mesentery in patients with ulcerative colitis were scarce. objective: this study aimed to explore the relationship between bacterial translocation and postoperative outcome by comparing the microbiome profile of different anatomical sites in patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent proctocolectomy and ipaa. design: a prospective study. setting: this study was conducted at the jinling hospital from august 2017 to may 2018. patients: samples of 27 patients with ulcerative colitis who had ipaa and 15 healthy controls who underwent routine colonoscopy were collected. main outcome measures: the microbiome profile of different tissue sites and short- and long-term outcomes after ipaa in patients with ulcerative colitis. results: bacterial dna was detected in mesenteric lymph nodes of 51.9% of patients with ulcerative colitis (14/27) and in mesenteric adipose tissue of 66.7% of patients (18/27). the microbiome in mesenteric lymph nodes and mesenteric adipose tissue resembled the mucosal microbiome to a greater extent than the fecal microbiome. positive bacterial dna in mesenteric lymph nodes (8/14 vs 0/13; p = 0.002) was associated with pouchitis within 12 months after ipaa, whereas bray-curtis distance in mesenteric lymph nodes was significantly different between patients with pouchitis and without (p = 0.009). limitations: this study was limited by its small sample size and lacked situ experiment to confirm the true bacterial translation. conclusions: bacterial translocation was highly prevalent in patients with ulcerative colitis. the translocated bacteria dna in mesenteric adipose tissue and mesenteric lymph nodes was highly correlated and more likely to originate from mucosal than fecal microbiome. also, the extent of bacterial translocation and translocation of certain bacteria might be associated with the early development of pouchitis after ipaa. this might represent an unprecedented technique to predict pouchitis using mesenteric lymph node bacterial profiles. see video abstract at http://links.lww.com/dcr/c119.",AB_0135
"part-level attribute parsing is a fundamental but challenging task, which requires the region-level visual understanding to provide explainable details of body parts. most existing approaches address this problem by adding a regional convolutional neural network (rcnn) with an attribute prediction head to a two-stage detector, in which attributes of body parts are identified from localwise part boxes. however, localwise part boxes with limit visual clues (i.e., part appearance only) lead to unsatisfying parsing results, since attributes of body parts are highly dependent on comprehensive relations among them. in this article, we propose a knowledge-embedded rcnn (ke-rcnn) to identify attributes by leveraging rich knowledge, including implicit knowledge (e.g., the attribute above-the-hip for a shirt requires visual/geometry relations of shirt-hip) and explicit knowledge (e.g., the part of shorts cannot have the attribute of hoodie or lining). specifically, the ke-rcnn consists of two novel components, that is: 1) implicit knowledge-based encoder (ik-en) and 2) explicit knowledge-based decoder (ek-de). the former is designed to enhance part-level representation by encoding part-part relational contexts into part boxes, and the latter one is proposed to decode attributes with a guidance of prior knowledge about part-attribute relations. in this way, the ke-rcnn is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any two-stage detectors, for example, attribute-rcnn, cascade-rcnn, hrnetbased rcnn, and swintransformer-based rcnn. extensive experiments conducted on two challenging benchmarks, for example, fashionpedia and kinetics-tps, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the ke-rcnn. in particular, it achieves higher improvements over all existing methods, reaching around 3% of ap(iou+f1)(al)l on fashionpedia and around 4% of accp on kinetics-tps. code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/sota-joson/ke-rcnn.",AB_0135
"mirnas are reported to be linked to the pathogenesis of human complex diseases. disease-related mirnas may serve as novel bio-marks and drug targets. this work focuses on designing a multi-relational graph convolutional network model to predict mirna-disease associations (hgcnmda) from a heterogeneous network. hgcnmda introduces a gene layer to construct a mirna-gene-disease heterogeneous network. we refine the features of nodes into initial and inductive features so that the direct and indirect associations between diseases and mirna can be considered simultaneously. then hgcnmda learns feature embeddings for mirnas and disease through a multi-relational graph convolutional network model that can assign appropriate weights to different types of edges in the heterogeneous network. finally, the mirna-disease associations were decoded by the inner product between mirna and disease feature embeddings. we apply our model to predict human mirna-disease associations. the hgcnmda is superior to the other state-of-the-art models in identifying missing mirna-disease associations and also performs well on recommending related mirnas/diseases to new diseases/ mirnas. the codes are available at https://github.com/weiba/hgcnmda.",AB_0135
