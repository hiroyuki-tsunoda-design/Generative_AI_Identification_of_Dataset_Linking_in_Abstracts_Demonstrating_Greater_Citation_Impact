"hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing image fusion (hmif) can effectively enhance image spatialspectral information representation. however, existing deep learning algorithms usually use neighboring pixels for interpolation in the sampling process, which ignores the correlation of different receptive field pixels. to solve the above problem, this study proposes an adaptive multi-perceptual field implicit guided sampling generative adversarial network (amgsgan) to enhance the long-range perception of the sampling process. the generator consists of precoding, multi-perceptual field feature extraction, and adaptive guided implicit sampling modules. the precoding module encodes the features of the images to enhance the feature expression capability, the multi-perceptual field feature extraction module is used to extract the multi-perceptual field features of the images by setting different convolutional dilation rates, and the adaptive guided implicit sampling module utilizes pixels with different distances to interpolate the features of the pixels to be sampled and fuses the interpolation results adaptively to generate the fusion image. the discriminator incorporates the pure cnn architecture and employs techniques such as batch normalization layer and adaptive average pooling layer to ensure the stability and convergence speed of the network. comparison experiments on several datasets show that the fusion performance of amgsgan is significantly better than the compared algorithms at 4x, 8x and 16x resolutions, which demonstrates the effectiveness of amgsgan. the code can be found at https://github.com/ch unyuzhu/amgsgan.",AB_0303
"seeking a low-cost, high-efficiency greenhouse mapping technology has immense significance. while greenhouse extraction methods using deep learning have been proposed, the challenge of extracting dense small objects remains an unresolved problem. the inherent downscaling strategy in general-purpose semantic segmentation (ss) models renders them unsuitable for such tasks. in contrast, the dramatically increasing computational complexity associated with this problem may result in an unaffordable cost for consumer-level applications. to address the aforementioned challenges, this study presents a novel greenhouse mapping model based on remote sensing (rs) images, which not only exhibits high precision and robust generalization capabilities but also offers significant lightweight advantages. to meet broader needs, we also provide corresponding customizable and scalable rules that allow for a trade-off between accuracy and speed. to evaluate the performance of our model, we select several representative works to conduct benchmark experiments on a self-annotated dataset. the results demonstrate that our method can provide more powerful visual representations for greenhouse segmentation with minimal cost. compared to the control group, the proposed method achieves an miou improvement of 1.116 %-10.77 % using only 3.282 m parameters, while maintaining a considerable inference speed. code will be available at: https://github.com/w-qp/egenet.git",AB_0303
"backgroundhigh oncogene expression in cancer cells is a major cause of rapid tumor progression and drug resistance. recent cancer genome research has shown that oncogenes as well as regulatory elements can be amplified in the form of extrachromosomal dna (ecdna) or subsequently integrated into chromosomes as homogeneously staining regions (hsrs). these genome-level variants lead to the overexpression of the corresponding oncogenes, resulting in poor prognosis. most existing detection methods identify ecdna using whole genome sequencing (wgs) data. however, these techniques usually detect many false positive regions owing to chromosomal dna interference.resultsin the present study, an algorithm called atacamp that can identify ecdna/hsrs in tumor genomes using atac-seq data has been described. high chromatin accessibility, one of the characteristics of ecdna, makes atac-seq naturally enriched in ecdna and reduces chromosomal dna interference. the algorithm was validated using atac-seq data from cell lines that have been experimentally determined to contain ecdna regions. atacamp accurately identified the majority of validated ecdna regions. ampliconarchitect, the widely used ecdna detecting tool, was used to detect ecdna regions based on the wgs data of the same cell lines. additionally, the circle-finder software, another tool that utilizes atac-seq data, was assessed. the results showed that atacamp exhibited higher accuracy than ampliconarchitect and circle-finder. moreover, atacamp supported the analysis of single-cell atac-seq data, which linked ecdna to specific cells.conclusionsatacamp, written in python, is freely available on github under the mit license: https://github.com/chsmiss/atac-amp. using atac-seq data, atacamp offers a novel analytical approach that is distinct from the conventional use of wgs data. thus, this method has the potential to reduce the cost and technical complexity associated ecdna analysis.",AB_0303
"backgroundgene expression profiles have important significance for gene expression characteristics and further functional studies. more attention has been given to the expression databases in humans and mice, but less attention has been given to rats, while rat models also play an irreplaceable role in biomedical experiments.resultsto depict the rat gene expression profiles in mrna expression levels, we analyzed over 2,700 rna sequencing (rna-seq) samples from 48 tissues, 40 primary cell types and 25 cell lines; and then mapped them to the latest version of the rat genome reference, mratbn7.2. based on these datasets and reanalysis, we constructed a new database, the omic horizon expression database (http://immudb.bjmu.edu.cn/expression.html), which allows expressional profile query of over 25,000 rat genes based on non-redundant gene symbols. the database supports requests using gene symbols (or alias), ensemble and entrez gene ids. gene expression profiles can be queried in three categories: tissues, primary cells and cell lines. application examples including expression profiling and comparison, as well as identification of novel rat genes, were illustrated to show the utility of the database.conclusionsas an omic resource, the omic horizon expression database provides horizons of gene expression profiles across various tissues and cells, which greatly facilitates the identification of rat genes as well as functional clues.",AB_0303
"the silkworm bombyx mori is a domesticated insect that serves as an animal model for research and agriculture. the silkworm super-pan-genome dataset, which we published last year, is a unique resource for the study of global genomic diversity and phenotype-genotype association. here we present silkmeta (http://silkmeta.org.cn), a comprehensive database covering the available silkworm pan-genome and multi-omics data. the database contains 1082 short-read genomes, 546 long-read assembled genomes, 1168 transcriptomes, 294 phenotype characterizations (phenome), tens of millions of variations (variome), 7253 long non-coding rnas (lncrnas), 18 717 full length transcripts and a set of population statistics. we have compiled publications on functional genomics research and genetic stock deciphering (mutant map). a range of bioinformatics tools is also provided for data visualization and retrieval. the large batch of omics data and tools were integrated in twelve functional modules that provide useful strategies and data for comparative and functional genomics research. the interactive bioinformatics platform silkmeta will benefit not only the silkworm but also the insect biology communities. graphical abstract",AB_0303
"large-scale genome-wide association studies (gwas) have provided profound insights into complex traits and diseases. yet, deciphering the fine-scale molecular mechanisms of how genetic variants manifest to cause the phenotypes remains a daunting task. here, we present colocdb (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/colocdb), a comprehensive genetic colocalization database by integrating more than 3000 gwas summary statistics and 13 types of xqtl to date. by employing two representative approaches for the colocalization analysis, colocdb deposits results from three key components: (i) gwas-xqtl, pair-wise colocalization between gwas loci and different types of xqtl, (ii) gwas-gwas, pair-wise colocalization between the trait-associated genetic loci from gwass and (iii) xqtl-xqtl, pair-wise colocalization between the genetic loci associated with molecular phenotypes in xqtls. these results together represent the most comprehensive colocalization analysis, which also greatly expands the list of shared variants with genetic pleiotropy. we expect that colocdb can serve as a unique and useful resource in advancing the discovery of new biological mechanisms and benefit future functional studies. graphical abstract",AB_0303
"convolutional neural networks have achieved impressive results in areas such as computer vision tasks. recently, more complex architectures have been designed that add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable deeper network training. a large number of trainable parameters are often required to acquire accurate results. as the number of parameters increases, the network structure becomes more intricate and complex, resulting in low model accuracy and wasted computational resources. motivated by the promising performance of brain-inspired neural computation principles, a new network structure can be constructed using a composition of the biological connectome. the nematode caenorhabditis elegans (c. elegans), as the only organism whose connectome has been fully mapped, is suitable to be selected for the construction of neural network structures. in this paper, the neuron connectome of c. elegans is encapsulated as a connectome block and used as the connection pattern of the convolutional layer in the convolutional network. therefore, this modified convolutional neural network structure is called the nematode connectome neural network (ncnn), and the detailed implementation is presented. moreover, comparative experiments on the cifar-100, cifar-10, mnist, and imagenet datasets are conducted to fully demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed ncnn model on image classification. in addition, the success of the ncnn also provides new ideas for future network structure design. the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/longjin-lab/nematode-connectome-neural-network.",AB_0303
"deep neural networks (dnns) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which are external entity model providers that can inject backdoors into the network for illegal purposes. current attack methods rely on manipulated images with embedded triggers to infiltrate carrier networks, but they suffer from detectable distortions and limited integration into neural networks. to delve further into the potential vulnerabilities of these models, this study introduces an innovative backdoor attack strategy, leveraging deep learning steganography through a generative adversarial network (gan). our approach utilizes steganography to create manipulated images, capitalizing on the unique sensitivity of neural networks to minute perturbations. the network is then trained de novo with these manipulated images, creating a backdoor-infused model. fundamentally, our method harnesses the pronounced sensitivity of dnns to nuanced alterations. experimental outcomes substantiate that our backdoor can be effectively integrated into the models, yielding high attack success rates. notably, it also adeptly circumvents both contemporary state-of-the-art defense mechanisms and human inspection. our source code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/dlairesearch/nnsdb.",AB_0303
"microproteins, prevalent across all kingdoms of life, play a crucial role in cell physiology and human health. although global gene transcription is widely explored and abundantly available, our understanding of microprotein functions using transcriptome data is still limited. to mitigate this problem, we present a database, mip-mining (https://weilab.sjtu.edu.cn/mipmining/), underpinned by high-quality rna-sequencing data exclusively aimed at analyzing microprotein functions. the mip-mining hosts 336 sets of high-quality transcriptome data from 8626 samples and nine representative living organisms, including microorganisms, plants, animals, and humans, in our mip-mining database. our database specifically provides a focus on a range of diseases and environmental stress conditions, taking into account chemical, physical, biological, and diseases-related stresses. comparatively, our platform enables customized analysis by inputting desired data sets with self-determined cutoff values. the practicality of mip-mining is demonstrated by identifying essential microproteins in different species and revealing the importance of atp15 in the acetic acid stress tolerance of budding yeast. we believe that mip-mining will facilitate a greater understanding and application of microproteins in biotechnology. moreover, it will be beneficial for designing therapeutic strategies under various biological conditions.",AB_0303
"existing studies have shown that user-item interaction data and social relation data can be jointly used for enhancing the performance of social recommendation. however, limited research has a focus on investigating how to deeply exploit different views of social interaction structures and rating behavior differences for further improving social recommendation. to this end, in this paper, we propose to integrate information from both semantic and structural views for social recommendation. specifically, we first design a collective intelligence-based strategy to reveal high-quality implicit relations for both users and items. then, by reformulating all available nodes and relations as a heterogeneous graph, we define multiple semantic metapaths to capture diverse preferences for comprehensive user and item representations. while various metapaths enlarge the representation capacity of users and items, they also introduce noise and irrelevant information. we recall that, for the user-item interaction graph, different structure sizes (e.g., local and global structures) provide diverse and complementary information for recommendation. motivated by this, we propose a semantic and structural view fusion framework for social recommendation (s4rec), which consists of a deep graph model and a wide attentive svd (singular value decomposition) model for rating prediction by taking the local and global structure as input and aggregating messages along the predefined metapaths. finally, the two predicted results are adaptively fused to achieve the final both accurate and stable prediction. in addition, we treat the user's rating behavior difference as the relative position difference problem in the embedding space, and model it with transh to improve the generalization ability of the main rating model. extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared with state-of-the-art methods. particularly, our model outperforms other baselines under different sparsity conditions, further validating the effectiveness on cold-start users. we release the source code at https://github.com/lcwy220/social-recommendation.",AB_0303
