"the rna binding protein (rbp) and non-coding rna (ncrna) interacting networks are increasingly re-cognized as the main mechanism in gene regulation, and are tightly associated with cellular malfunction and disease. here, we present frnc, a systems biology tool to uncover the dynamic spectrum of rbp-ncrna circuits (rnc) by integrating transcriptomics, interactomics and proteomics data. frnc constructs the rbp-ncrna network derived from clip-seq or pare experiments. given scoring on nodes and edges according to differential analysis of expression data, it finds an rnc containing global maximum significant rbps and ncrnas. alternatively, it can also capture the locally maximum scoring rnc according to user-defined starting nodes with the greedy search. when compared with existing tools, frnc can detect more accurate and robust sub-network with scalability. as shown in the cases of esophageal carcinoma, breast cancer and alzheimer's disease, frnc enables users to analyze the collective behaviors between rbp and the interacting ncrnas, and reveal novel insights into the disease-associated processes. the frnc r package is available at https://github.com/bioinformaticsstu/frnc.

"the cells of colorectal cancer (crc) in their microenvironment experience constant stress, leading to dys-regulated activity in the tumor niche. as a result, cancer cells acquire alternative pathways in response to the changing microenvironment, posing significant challenges for the design of effective cancer treatment strategies. while computational studies on high-throughput omics data have advanced our understanding of crc subtypes, characterizing the heterogeneity of this disease remains remarkably complex. here, we present a novel computational pipeline for characterizing alternative mechanisms (pcam) based on bi-clustering to gain a more detailed understanding of cancer heterogeneity. our application of pcam to large-scale crc transcriptomics datasets suggests that pcam can generate a wealth of information leading to new biological understanding and predictive markers of alternative mechanisms. our key findings include: 1) a comprehensive collection of alternative pathways in crc, associated with biological and clinical factors. 2) full annotation of detected alternative mechanisms, including their enrichment in known pathways and associations with various clinical outcomes. 3) a mechanistic relationship between known clinical subtypes and outcomes on a consensus map, visualized by the presence of alternative mechanisms. 4) several po-tential novel alternative drug resistance mechanisms for oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and folfox, some of which were validated on independent datasets. we believe that gaining a deeper understanding of alter-native mechanisms is a critical step towards characterizing the heterogeneity of crc. the hypotheses generated by pcam, along with the comprehensive collection of biologically and clinically associated al-ternative pathways in crc, could provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving cancer progression and drug resistance, which could aid in the development of more effective cancer therapies and guide experimental design towards more targeted and personalized treatment strategies. the computa-tional pipeline of pcam is available in github (https://github.com/changwn/bc-crc).(c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0320
"screening biomolecular markers from high-dimensional biological data is one of the long-standing tasks for biomedical translational research. with its advantages in both feature shrinkage and biological interpret-ability, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) algorithm is one of the most popular methods for the scenarios of clinical biomarker development. however, in practice, applying lasso on omics-based data with high dimensions and low-sample size may usually result in an excess number of predictive variables, leading to the overfitting of the model. here, we present vsolassobag, a wrapped lasso approach by integrating an ensemble learning strategy to help select efficient and stable variables with high confidence from omics-based data. using a bagging strategy in combination with a parametric method or inflection point search method, vsolassobag can integrate and vote variables generated from multiple lasso models to determine the optimal candidates. the application of vsolassobag on both simulation datasets and real-world datasets shows that the algorithm can effectively identify markers for either case-control binary classification or prognosis prediction. in addition, by comparing with multiple existing algorithms, vsolassobag shows a comparable performance under different scenarios while resulting in fewer features than others. in summary, vsolassobag, which is available at https://seqworld. com/vsolassobag/ under the gpl v3 license, provides an alternative strategy for selecting reliable bio-markers from high-dimensional omics data. for user's convenience, we implement vsolassobag as an r package that provides multithreading computing configurations. copyright (c) 2022, the authors. institute of genetics and developmental biology, chinese academy of sciences, and genetics society of china. published by elsevier limited and science press. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0320
"esophageal cancer is the seventh most prevalent and the sixth most lethal cancer. esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) is one of the major esophageal cancer subtypes that accounts for 87 % of the total cases. however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. here, we present an integrated database for escc called esccdb, which includes a total of 56 datasets and published studies from the geo, xena or sra databases and related publications. it helps users to explore a particular gene with multiple graphical and interactive views with one click. the results comprise expression changes across 20 datasets, copy number alterations in 11 datasets, somatic mutations from 12 papers, related drugs derived from dgidb, related pathways, and gene correlations. esccdb enables directly cross-dataset comparison of a gene's mutations, expressions and copy number changes in multiple datasets. this allows users to easily assess the alterations in escc. furthermore, survival analysis, drug-gene relationships, and results from whole-genome crispr/ cas9 screening can help users determine the clinical relevance, derive functional inferences, and identify potential drugs. notably, esccdb also enables the exploration of the correlation structure and identification of potential key regulators for a process. finally, we identified 789 consistently differential expressed genes; we summarized recurrently mutated genes and genes affected by significant copy number alterations. these genes may be stable biomarkers or important players during escc development. esccdb fills the gap between massive omics data and users' needs for integrated analysis and can promote basic and clinical escc research. the database is freely accessible at http://cailab.labshare.cn/esccdb.(c) 2023 published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ( licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).",AB_0320
"recently, 3d deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks like their 2d counterparts. most of the state-of-the-art (sota) 3d adversarial attacks perform perturbation to 3d point clouds. to reproduce these attacks in the physical scenario, a generated adversarial 3d point cloud needs to be reconstructed to mesh, which leads to a significant drop in its adversarial effect. in this paper, we propose a strong 3d adversarial attack named mesh attack to address this problem by directly performing perturbation on mesh of a 3d object. in order to take advantage of the most effective gradient-based attack, a differentiable sample module that back-propagate the gradient of point cloud to mesh is introduced. to further ensure the adversarial mesh examples without outlier and 3d printable, three mesh losses are adopted. extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms sota 3d attacks by a significant margin. we also achieved sota performance under various defenses. our code will be available at: https://github .com /cuge1995 /mesh -attack.",AB_0320
"minorg is an offline grna design tool that gen-erates the smallest possible combination of grna capable of covering all desired targets in multiple non-reference genomes. as interest in pangenomic research grows, so does the workload required for large screens in multiple individuals. minorg aims to lessen this workload by capitalising on sequence homology to favour multi-target grna while simulta-neously screening multiple genetic backgrounds in order to generate reusable grna panels. we demon-strated the practical application of minorg by knock-ing out 11 homologous genes tandemly arrayed in a multi-gene cluster in two arabidopsis thaliana lin-eages using three grna output by minorg. we also described a new pcr-free modular cloning system for multiplexing grna, and used it to knockout three tandemly arrayed genes in another multi-gene clus-ter with grna designed by minorg. source code is freely available at https://github.com/rlrq/minorg.",AB_0320
"recent years have witnessed tremendous progress with regard to few-shot learning methods, especially for classification and segmentation tasks. however, the challenging few-shot image generation has garnered less attention. training gans with limited data is a formidable task since discriminator overfitting and memorizing degrade synthesis quality. existing approaches endeavor to expand the training set with data augmentation techniques. in this paper, we propose protogan, a gan that incorporates the metric-learning-based prototype mechanism into adversarial learning. concretely, we align the prototypes and features of real and generated images in the embedding space, facilitating the fidelity of the generated images. we include a variance term in the objective function in order to promote the synthesis diversity of the generative network. as an intuitive yet effective method, protogan is easy to implement and is complementary to existing methods. we perform extensive experiments on nineteen datasets spanning a variety of domains and resolutions. both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for high-quality image synthesis under limited data. our code is available at https://github.com/kobeshegu/protogan.",AB_0320
"heterogeneous graph embedding is receiving increasing attention from researchers due to the ubiquity of heterogeneous graphs (hgs). how to effectively handle the problem of missing features in hgs has become a hot research topic in recent years. however, the existing heterogeneous graph neural networks (hgnns) with feature completion are facing two challenges: (1) pre-training is required; and (2) heterogeneous information in the hg is not fully explored. to this end, we propose a heterogeneous residual graph attention network via feature completion (hetregat-fc). specifically, we first design a heterogeneous residual graph attention network (hetregat) to learn topological information. then, the attention mechanism is adopted to complete the missing features. finally, hetregat is used to learn the final node embeddings on the feature completed heterogeneous graph. to prove the effectiveness of this work, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and compare it with ten competitive baselines. the results demonstrate that the proposed hetregat-fc significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. the codes and data of this work are available at https:// github .com /zzy -graphmininglab /hetregat-fc.",AB_0320
"the three-way decisions strategy has been employed to construct network topology in a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (sfnn). however, this model has a general performance, and does not consider the process costs, since it has fixed threshold parameters. inspired by the sequential three-way decisions (stwd), this paper proposes stwd with an sfnn (stwd-sfnn) to enhance the performance of networks on structured datasets. stwd-sfnn adopts multi-granularity levels to dynamically learn the number of hidden layer nodes from coarse to fine, and set the sequential threshold parameters. specifically, at the coarse granular level, stwd-sfnn handles easy-to-classify instances by applying strict threshold conditions, and with the increasing number of hidden layer nodes at the fine granular level, stwd-sfnn focuses more on disposing of the difficult-to-classify instances by applying loose threshold conditions, thereby realizing the classification of instances. moreover, stwd-sfnn considers and reports the process cost produced from each granular level. the experimental results verify that stwd-sfnn has a more compact network on structured datasets than other sfnn models, and has better generalization performance than the competitive models. all models and datasets can be downloaded from https://github .com /wuc567 /machine -learning /tree /main /stwd-sfnn.",AB_0320
"established taxonomy system based on disease symptom and tissue characteristics have provided an im-portant basis for physicians to correctly identify diseases and treat them successfully. however, these classifications tend to be based on phenotypic observations, lacking a molecular biological foundation. therefore, there is an urgent to integrate multi-dimensional molecular biological information or multi-omics data to redefine disease classification in order to provide a powerful perspective for understanding the molecular structure of diseases. therefore, we offer a flexible disease classification that integrates the biological process, gene expression, and symptom phenotype of diseases, and propose a disease-disease association network based on multi-view fusion. we applied the fusion approach to 223 diseases and di-vided them into 24 disease clusters. the contribution of internal and external edges of disease clusters were analyzed. the results of the fusion model were compared with medical subject headings, a traditional and commonly used disease taxonomy. then, experimental results of model performance comparison show that our approach performs better than other integration methods. as it was observed, the obtained clusters provided more interesting and novel disease-disease associations. this multi-view human disease asso-ciation network describes relationships between diseases based on multiple molecular levels, thus breaking through the limitation of the disease classification system based on tissues and organs. this approach which motivates clinicians and researchers to reposition the understanding of diseases and explore diagnosis and therapy strategies, extends the existing disease taxonomy. availability of data and materials: the preprocessed dataset and source code supporting the conclusions of this article are available at github repository https://github.com/yangxiaoxi89/mvhdn.(c) 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license ().",AB_0320
