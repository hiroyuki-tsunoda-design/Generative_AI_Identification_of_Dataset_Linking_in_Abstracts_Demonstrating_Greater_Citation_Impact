"accurate identification of chicken gender helps farms to optimize breeding sex ratios and programs. a chicken gender identification method based on an improved resnet-50 deep learning algorithm was proposed in this study. the squeeze-and-excitation (se) attention was introduced to improve the residual units of resnet-50, and the swish function and ranger optimizer were combined for ensuring feature learning and training effectiveness to further enhance the model performance. a public dataset acquired from a commercial farm was used to train and test the algorithm, which has a total of 960 images of chickens with different genders, scenes, and behaviors. the ablation tests were performed to verify the contribution of the se module, swish, and ranger optimizer to the algorithm. the deep features of the proposed algorithm were visualized with heat maps to show the contribution of different body parts to gender identification. moreover, the algorithm was compared with five typical recognition algorithms including alexnet, googlenet, vgg-16, resnet-18, and densenet-201, as well as four state-of-the-art (sota) animal gender identification methods. the results showed that the ranger optimizer, swish activation function, and se attention improved the accuracy of gender recognition by 0.14%, 0.35%, and 1.81%, and the heat maps indicated that the head and tail contributed more to gender recognition. more spe-cifically, the algorithm achieved better overall performance than the five algorithms and four gender identifi-cation methods with the accuracy, precision, recall, f1, and inference time of 98.42%, 97.92%, 98.95%, 98.43%, and 4.79 ms, respectively. furthermore, tests on the private dataset collected in a real chicken farm by the poultry house inspection robot revealed that the algorithm could identify chicken gender well, and initially reflected that it was feasible to develop a gender recognition function on an inspection robot. the code and dataset of this study will be released on github(https://github.com/puristwu/identifying-gender) as soon as the study is published, and new data would be updated as well in the future.",AB_0197

"although most existing methods using generative adversarial networks (gan) generally produce plausible results, there is a significant amount of artifacts and less-than-ideal restoration of textures when large regions are missing or the background of missing regions is complex. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel texture-aware backbone net named rfa-net for finer texture image inpainting. compared to conventional encoder-decoder methods, our main contribution is proposing a novel rfa-net adopt a non-pooling residual cnn structure with three novel modules, which retains texture features from shallow layers and adaptively learn the importance of certain channels and locations of features that may potentially benefit image inpainting. in addition, we propose a hybrid loss optimization (hlo) module to enable the generator to focus on the semantic and texture details of the inpainted contents. experimental results demonstrate that our rfa-net is able to recover texture details and ground-truth consistent images, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in terms of image quality and quantitative metrics. our source code and data are available online at https://github.com/jamie-61/rfa-net-inpainting.",AB_0197
"backgroundcomprehensive eye examinations for diabetic retinopathy is poorly implemented in medically underserved areas. there is a critical need for a widely available and economical tool to aid patient selection for priority retinal screening. we investigated the possibility of a predictive model for retinopathy identification using simple parameters. methodsclinical data were retrospectively collected from 4, 159 patients with diabetes admitted to five tertiary hospitals. independent predictors were identified by univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression, and a nomogram was developed based on a multivariate logistic regression model. the validity and clinical practicality of this nomogram were assessed using concordance index (c-index), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc), calibration curves, decision curve analysis (dca), and clinical impact curves (cic). resultsthe predictive factors in the multivariate model included the duration of diabetes, history of hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. the three-variable model displayed medium prediction ability with an auroc of 0.722 (95%ci 0.696-0.748) in the training set, 0.715 (95%ci 0.670-0.754) in the internal set, and 0.703 (95%ci 0.552-0.853) in the external dataset. dca showed that the threshold probability of dr in diabetic patients was 17-55% according to the nomogram, and cic also showed that the nomogram could be applied clinically if the risk threshold exceeded 30%. an operation interface on a webpage (https://cqmuxss.shinyapps.io/dr_tjj/) was built to improve the clinical utility of the nomogram. conclusionsthe predictive model developed based on a minimal amount of clinical data available to diabetic patients with restricted medical resources could help primary healthcare practitioners promptly identify potential retinopathy.",AB_0197
"backgroundrenal cell carcinoma (rcc) is a highly metastatic urological cancer. rcc with liver metastasis (lm) carries a dismal prognosis. the objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ml) model that predicts the risk of rcc with lm, which is used to assist clinical treatment. methodsthe retrospective study data of 42,547 patients with rcc were extracted from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database. ml includes algorithmic methods and is a fast-rising field that has been widely used in the biomedical field. logistic regression (lr), gradient boosting machine (gbm), extreme gradient boosting (xgb), random forest (rf), decision tree (dt), and naive bayesian model [naive bayes classifier (nbc)] were applied to develop prediction models to predict the risk of rcc with lm. the six models were 10-fold cross-validated, and the best-performing model was selected based on the area under the curve (auc) value. a web online calculator was constructed based on the best ml model. resultsbone metastasis, lung metastasis, grade, t stage, n stage, and tumor size were independent risk factors for the development of rcc with lm by multivariate regression analysis. in addition, the correlation of the relative proportions of the six clinical variables was shown by a heat map. in the prediction models of rcc with lm, the mean auc of the xgb model among the six ml algorithms was 0.947. based on the xgb model, the web calculator (https://share.streamlit.io/liuwencai4/renal_liver/main/renal_liver.py) was developed to evaluate the risk of rcc with lm. conclusionsthis xgb model has the best predictive effect on rcc with lm. the web calculator constructed based on the xgb model has great potential for clinicians to make clinical decisions and improve the prognosis of rcc patients with lm.",AB_0197

"aspect-based sentiment analysis (absa) is a crucial natural language understanding (nlu) research field which aims to accurately recognize reviewers' opinions on different aspects of products and services. despite the prominence of recent absa applications, mainstream absa approaches inevitably rely on large-scale supervised corpora, and their final performances is susceptible to the quality of the training datasets. however, annotating sufficient data is labour intensive, which presents a significant barrier for generalizing a high-quality sentiment analysis model. nonetheless, humans can make more accurate judgement based on their external background knowledge, such as factoid triples knowledge and event causality. inspired by the investigations on external knowledge enhancement strategies in other popular nlp research, we propose a novel knowledge augmentation framework for absa, named the oxford dictionary descriptive knowledge-infused aspect-based sentiment analysis (dictabsa). comprehensive experiments with many state-of-the-art approaches on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed dictabsa significantly outperforms previous main-stream absa methods. for instance, compared with the baselines, our bert-based knowledge infusion strategy achieves a substantial 6.42% and 5.26% absolute accuracy gain when adopting bert-spc on semeval2014 and absa-deberta on aclshortdata, respectively. furthermore, to effectively make use of dictionary knowledge we devise several alternative knowledge infusion strategies. extensive experiments using different knowledge infused strategies further demonstrate that the proposed knowledge infusion strategies effectively enhance the sentiment polarity identification capability. the python implementation of our dictabsa is publicly available at https://github.com/albert-jin/dictionaryfused-e2e-absa.",AB_0197
"data-dependent acquisition (dda) mode in ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (uhplc-hrms) can provide massive amounts of ms1 and ms/ms information of compounds in untargeted metabolomics and can thus facilitate compound identification greatly. in this work, we developed a new platform called antdas-dda for the automatic processing of uhplc-hrms data sets acquired under the dda mode. several algorithms, including extracted ion chromatogram extraction, feature extraction, ms/ms spectrum construction, fragment ion identification, and ms1 spectrum construction, were developed within the platform. the performance of antdas-dda was investigated comprehensively with a mixture of standard and complex plant data sets. results suggested that features in complex sample matrices can be extracted effectively, and the constructed ms1 and ms/ms spectra can benefit in compound identification greatly. the efficiency of compound identification can be improved by about 20%. antdas-dda can take full advantage of ms/ms information in multiple sample analyses and provide more ms/ms spectra than single sample analysis. a comparison with advanced data analysis tools indicated that antdas-dda may be used as an alternative for routine uhplc-hrms-based untargeted metabolomics. antdas-dda is freely available at http://www.pmdb.org.cn/antdasdda.",AB_0197
"region of interest (roi) extraction is a fundamen-tal step in analyzing metabolomic datasets acquired by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms). however, noises and backgrounds in lc-ms data often affect the quality of extracted rois. therefore, developing effective roi evaluation algorithms is necessary to eliminate false positives meanwhile keep the false-negative rate as low as possible. in this study, a deep fused filter of rois (dffroi) was proposed to improve the accuracy of roi extraction by combining the handcrafted evaluation metrics with convolutional neural network (cnn)-learned representations. to evaluate the performance of dffroi, dffroi was compared with peakonly (cnn-learned representation) and five handcrafted metrics on three lc-ms datasets and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) dataset. results show that dffroi can achieve higher accuracy, better true-positive rate, and lower false-positive rate. its accuracy, true-positive rate, and false-positive rate are 0.9841, 0.9869, and 0.0186 on the test set, respectively. the classification error rate of dffroi (1.59%) is significantly reduced compared with peakonly (2.73%). the model-agnostic feature importance demonstrates the necessity of fusing handcrafted evaluation metrics with the convolutional neural network representations. dffroi is an automatic, robust, and universal method for roi filtering by virtue of information fusion and end-to-end learning. it is implemented in python programming language and open-sourced at https://github.com/zhanghailiangcsu/dffroi under bsd license. furthermore, it has been integrated into the kpic2 framework previously proposed by our group to facilitate real metabolomic lc-ms dataset analysis.",AB_0197
"magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is one of the most important modalities for clinical diagnosis. however, the main disadvantages of mri are the long scanning time and the moving artifact caused by patient movement during prolonged imaging. it can also lead to patient anxiety and discomfort, so accelerated imaging is indispensable for mri. convolutional neural network (cnn) based methods have become the fact standard for medical image reconstruction, and generative adversarial network (gan) have also been widely used. nevertheless, due to the limited ability of cnn to capture long-distance information, it may lead to defects in the structure of the reconstructed images such as blurry contour. in this paper, we propose a novel swin transformerbased dual-domain generative adversarial network (swingan) for accelerated mri reconstruction. the swingan consists of two generators: a frequency-domain generator and an image-domain generator. both the generators utilize swin transformer as backbone for effectively capturing the long-distance dependencies. a contextual image relative position encoder (cirpe) is designed to enhance the ability to capture local information. we extensively evaluate the method on the ixi brain dataset, miccai 2013 dataset and mrnet knee dataset. compared with kigan, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (psnr) and structural similarity index measure (ssim) are improved by 6.1% and 1.49% to 37.64 db and 0.98 on ixi dataset respectively, which demonstrates that our model can sufficiently utilize the local and global information of image. the model shows promising performance and robustness under different undersampling masks, different acceleration rates and different datasets. but it needs high hardware requirements with the increasing of the network parameters. the code is available at: https://github.com/learnerzx/swingan.",AB_0197
