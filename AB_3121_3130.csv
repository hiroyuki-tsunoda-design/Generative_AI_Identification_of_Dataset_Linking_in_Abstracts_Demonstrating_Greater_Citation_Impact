"deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks incrementally. incremental learning has been proposed to retain the knowledge of old classes while learning to identify new classes. a typical approach is to use a few exemplars to avoid forgetting old knowledge. in such a scenario, data imbalance between old and new classes is a key issue that leads to performance degradation of the model. several strategies have been designed to rectify the bias towards the new classes due to data imbalance. however, they heavily rely on the assumptions of the bias relation between old and new classes. therefore, they are not suitable for complex real-world applications. in this study, we propose an assumption-agnostic method, multi-granularity regularized re-balancing (mgrb), to address this problem. re-balancing methods are used to alleviate the influence of data imbalance; however, we empirically discover that they would under-fit new classes. to this end, we further design a novel multi-granularity regularization term that enables the model to consider the correlations of classes in addition to re-balancing the data. a class hierarchy is first constructed by ontology or grouping semantically or visually similar classes. the multi-granularity regularization then transforms the one-hot label vector into a continuous label distribution, which reflects the relations between the target class and other classes based on the constructed class hierarchy. thus, the model can learn the inter-class relational information, which helps enhance the learning of both old and new classes. experimental results on both public datasets and a real-world fault diagnosis dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. code is available at https://github.com/lilyht/cil-mgrb.",AB_0313
"molecular interaction prediction is essential in various applications including drug discovery and material science. the problem becomes quite challenging when the interaction is represented by unmapped relationships in molecular networks, namely molecular interaction, because it easily suffers from (i) insufficient labeled data with many false-positive samples, and (ii) ignoring a large number of biological entities with rich information in the knowledge graph. most of the existing methods cannot properly exploit the information of knowledge graph and molecule graph simultaneously. in this paper, we propose a large-scale knowledge graph enhanced multi-task learning model, namely kg-mtl, which extracts the features from both knowledge graph and molecular graph in a synergistic way. moreover, we design an effective shared unit that helps the model to jointly preserve the semantic relations of drug entity and the neighbor structures of the compound in both knowledge graph and molecular graph. extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed kg-mtl outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two representative molecular interaction prediction tasks: drug-target interaction prediction and compound-protein interaction prediction. the source code of kg-mtl is available at https://github.com/xzenglab/kg-mtl.",AB_0313
"among a big body of recently developed algorithms for machine learning and data mining, a class of models using non-convex/non-smooth sparsity-inducing norms achieves promising results on many challenging tasks. an important problem faced with such models is to find an effective solution for the objective function with one or multiple intractable terms. although a large number of optimization approaches have been developed, most of them are tailored to a specific model. besides, these approaches generally introduce some additional parameters and no longer guarantee convergence. in this work, we first revisit some representative non-convex/non-smooth machine learning models, and then unity them into a generic formulation. theoretically, we develop a simple yet efficient optimization framework, namely iteratively re-weighted method (irw), to solve such a class of models and provide the corresponding convergence analysis. particularly, we validate our proposed method on two challenging machine learning tasks: multi-task regression and feature selection. source codes are available at: https://github.com/kdd-code/sparse.git.",AB_0313
"in recommender systems, some features directly affect whether an interaction would happen, making the happened interactions not necessarily indicate user preference. for instance, short videos are objectively easier to finish even though the user may not like the video. we term such feature as confounding feature, and video length is a confounding feature in video recommendation. if we fit a model on such interaction data, just as done by most data-driven recommender systems, the model will be biased to recommend short videos more, and deviate from user actual requirement. this work formulates and addresses the problem from the causal perspective. assuming there are some factors affecting both the confounding feature and other item features, e.g., the video creator, we find the confounding feature opens a backdoor path behind user-item matching and introduces spurious correlation. to remove the effect of backdoor path, we propose a framework named deconfounding causal recommendation (dcr), which performs intervened inference with do-calculus. nevertheless, evaluating do-calculus requires to sum over the prediction on all possible values of confounding feature, significantly increasing the time cost. to address the efficiency challenge, we further propose a mixture-of-experts (moe) model architecture, modeling each value of confounding feature with a separate expert module. through this way, we retain the model expressiveness with few additional costs. we demonstrate dcr on the backbone model of neural factorizationmachine (nfm), showing that dcr leads to more accurate prediction of user preference with small inference time cost. we release our code at: https://github.com/zyang1580/dcr.",AB_0313
"clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records (ehr) can assist doctors in better judgment and can make sense of early diagnosis. however, the prediction performance heavily relies on effective representations from multi-dimensional time-series ehr data. existing solutions usually focus on temporal features or inherent relations between clinical event variables or extract both information in two separate phases. this usually leads to insufficient patient feature information and results in poor prediction performance. moreover, existing methods based on heterogeneous graph neural network usually require manual selection of proper meta-paths. to solve these problems, we propose the time-aware context-gated graph attention network (t-contextggan). specifically, we design a gnn based module with time-aware meta-paths and self-attention mechanism to extract both temporal semantic information and inherent relations of ehr data simultaneously and perform automatic meta-path selection. to evaluate the proposed model, we extract the first 48 hour ehr data in the first intensive care unit (icu) admission of three different tasks from two open-source datasets and model various clinical variables on the proposed ehrgraph. extensive experimental results show the proposed model can effectively extract informative features, and outperform existing state-of-art models in terms of various prediction measures. our code is available in https://github.com/owlcitizen/tcontext-ggan.",AB_0313
"implementing existing federated learning in massive internet of things (iot) networks faces critical challenges, such as imbalanced and statistically heterogeneous data and device diversity. to this end, we propose a semi-federated learning (semifl) framework to provide a potential solution for the realization of intelligent iot. by seamlessly integrating the centralized and federated paradigms, our semifl framework shows high scalability in terms of the number of iot devices even in the presence of computing-limited sensors. furthermore, compared to traditional learning approaches, the proposed semifl can make better use of distributed data and computing resources, due to the collaborative model training between the edge server and local devices. simulation results show the effectiveness of our semifl framework for massive iot networks. the code can be found at https://github.com/niwanli/semifl_iot.",AB_0313
"multi-view clustering is an important research topic due to its capability to utilize complementary information from multiple views. however, there are few methods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear clustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. to address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature learning for deep multi-view clustering (sdmvc). concretely, deep autoencoders are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. to leverage the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of some views' unclear clustering structures. in a self-supervised manner, pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform multi-view discriminative feature learning. during this process, global discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target distribution. besides, this unified target distribution can make sdmvc learn consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency of multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. experiments on various types of multi-view datasets show that sdmvc outperforms 14 competitors including classic and state-of-the-art methods. the code is available at https://github.com/submissionsin/sdmvc.",AB_0313
"unsupervised domain adaptation (uda) aims to utilize knowledge from a label-rich source domain to understand a similar yet distinct unlabeled target domain. notably, global distribution statistics across domains and local semantic characteristics across samples, are two essential factors of data analysis that should be fully explored. most existing uda approaches either harness only one of them or fail to closely associate them for efficient adaptation. in this work, we propose a unified framework, called collaborative alignment framework (caf), which simultaneously reduces the global domain discrepancy and preserves the local semantic consistency for cross-domain knowledge transfer in a collaborative manner. specifically, for domain-oriented alignment, we utilize adversarial training or minimize the wasserstein distance between the two distributions to learn domain-level invariant representations. for semantic-oriented matching, we capture the semantic discrepancy between the predictions of two diverse task-specific classifiers and enhance the features of target data to be near the support of the source data class-wisely, which promotes semantic consistency across domains effectively. these two adaptation processes can be deeply intertwined in caf via collaborative training, thus caf can learn domain-invariant and semantic-consistent feature representations. extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks, including domainnet, visda-2017, office-31, and imageclef, demonstrate the proposed methods significantly outperform the existing methods, especially on the large-scale dataset. the code is available at https://github.com/bit-da/caf.",AB_0313
"while recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of research papers on recommender system (rs), most of the papers focus on inventing machine learning models to better fit user behavior data. however, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. this makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, and so on. to transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. when reviewing the papers that consider biases in rs, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. the terminology bias is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. this motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on rs biases. in this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. we then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic. the summary of debiasing methods reviewed in this survey can be found at https://github.com/jiawei-chen/recdebiasing.",AB_0313
"the influence of adaptive evolution on disease susceptibility has drawn attention; however, the extent of the influence, whether favored mutations also influence drug responses, and whether the associations between the three are population-specific remain unknown. using a reported deep learning network to integrate seven statistical tests for detecting selection signals, we predicted favored mutations in the genomes of 17 human populations and integrated these favored mutations with reported gwas sites and drug response-related variants into the database poptradeoff (http://www.gaemons.net/popfmintro). the database also contains genome annotation information on the snp, sequence, gene, and pathway levels. the preliminary data analyses suggest that substantial associations exist between adaptive evolution, disease susceptibility, and drug responses and that the associations are highly population-specific. the database may be valuable for disease studies, drug development, and personalized medicine. & copy; 2023 the authors. published by elsevier b.v. on behalf of research network of computational and structural biotechnology. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0313
