"in the application of metaheuristic algorithms (mas) to complicated optimization problem solving, it is significant to balance the exploitation and exploration to obtain a good near-optimum solution to the problem. therefore, in this study, to balance the exploitative and explorative features of conventional mas, a multi-strategy improved slime mould algorithm called msma is introduced. in msma, a new search equation is developed to achieve a tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. then the dynamic random search technique is utilized as a local search engine to enhance the search efficiency of the algorithm. finally, the adaptive mutation probability is designed to avoid premature convergence. msma is evaluated using 28 benchmark functions and several practical engineering issues such as welded beam design, pressure vessel design, tension/compression spring design, and uav path planning. the simulation results based on 30 independent runs demonstrate that it is more efficient and robust than other state-of-the-art techniques from the literature according to the selected performance metrics such as mean values and standard deviations. the source code of msma is publicly available at https://github.com/denglingyun123/multi-s trategy-improved-slime-mould-algorithm.(c) 2022 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0017
"deep learning techniques have achieved promising results in code clone detection in the past decade. unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods rarely explicitly consider the modeling of long codes. worse, the code length is increasing due to the increasing requirement of complex functions. thus, modeling the relationship between code tokens to catch their long-range dependencies is crucial to comprehensively capture the information of the code fragment. in this work, we resort to the transformer to capture long-range dependencies within a code, which however requires huge computational cost for long code fragments. to make it possible to apply transformer efficiently, we propose a code token learner to largely reduce the number of feature tokens in an automatic way. besides, considering the tree structure of the abstract syntax tree, we present a tree-based position embedding to encode the position of each token in the input. apart from the transformer that captures the dependency within a code, we further leverage a cross-code attention module to capture the similarities between two code fragments. our method significantly reduces the computational cost of using transformer by 97% while achieves superior performance with state-of-the-art methods. our code is available at https://github.com/arctichare105/code-token-learner.(c) 2022 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",AB_0017
"differentiable architecture search (darts) is one of the prevailing paradigms of neural architecture search (nas) due to allowing efficient gradient-based optimization during the search phase. however, its poor stability and generalizability are intolerable. we argue that the crux is the locally optimal architecture parameter caused by a dilemma, which is that the solutions to the matthew effect and discretization discrepancy are inconsistent. to escape from the dilemma, we propose an architecture entropy to measure the discrepancy of the architecture parameters of different candidate operations and use it as a regularizer to control the learning of architecture parameters. extensive experiments show that an architecture entropy regularizer with a negative or positive coefficient can effectively solve one side of the contradiction respectively, and the regularizer with a variable coefficient can relieve darts from the dilemma. experimental results demonstrate that our architecture entropy regularizer can significantly improve different differentiable nas algorithms on different datasets and different search spaces. furthermore, we also achieve more accurate and more robust results on cifar-10 and imagenet. the code is publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/darts-aer.(c) 2022 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.",AB_0017
"self-diffusion coefficient can be derived from molecular dynamics (md) simulations by fitting the mean squared displacement (msd) into the einstein relation. however, the finite system size, nonfulfillment of the brownian motion, and finite simulation time may bring in significant uncertainties that need to be estimated. we present a python module to facilitate the accurate determination of self-diffusion coefficient from the einstein relation. we show that the ballistic stage can be clearly recognized and excluded to improve the accuracy and efficiency of self-diffusion coefficient calculation. the correct self -diffusion coefficient and its uncertainty can be conveniently obtained by taking the ensemble average of diffusion coefficients calculated at different time intervals. at the meantime, the module calculates viscosity that can correct the md-derived self-diffusion coefficient to the thermodynamic limit. program summary program title: md2d version 1.2.0 cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /d2x8rw83jb .1 code ocean capsule: https://codeocean .com /capsule /2259048 licensing provisions: gnu general public license, version 3 programming language: python nature of problem: accurate determination of self-diffusion coefficient from molecular dynamics by using the einstein relation is hampered by the finite system size. solution method: self-diffusion coefficient can be accurately determined from molecular dynamics simulations by fitting the einstein relation with correct choice of parameters and correcting to the thermodynamic limit.

"sleep staging is an essential step in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-related diseases. currently, most supervised learning models face the problem of insufficient labeled data. in addition, most sleep staging models are based on multi-channel eeg, and the models are too complex to be suitable for home sleep monitoring scenarios. to tackle these problems, this study proposes a sleep staging method based on pseudo -label optimization and a single-channel sleep hybrid neural network called shnn. in the shnn model, we design a multi-scale convolutional neural network (cnn) to extract the features from the single-channel eeg and use a bi-directional recurrent gating unit (bi-gru) to obtain temporal context information of sleep data sequences. extensive experiments based on the single-channel eeg (fpz-cz, pz-oz, and cz-a1) of the sleep-edfx and the dreams-sub datasets validate the effectiveness of the shnn model and the pseudo-label optimization algorithm therein outperforming current single-channel methods regarding the accuracy, kappa, and mf1 score. moreover, the pseudo-label optimization algorithm can achieve good results on other sleep staging methods. the shnn code is available at https://github.com/caowenpeng/shnn.",AB_0017
"accurate building change detection is crucial for understanding urban development. although fully supervised deep learning-based methods for building change detection have made progress, they tend to fuse temporal information only at a single level (e.g., input, feature, or decision levels) to mitigate the data distribution differences between time-series images, which is highly prone to introduce a large number of pseudo changes. moreover, these methods rely on a large number of high-quality pixel-level change labels with high acquisition costs. in contrast, available crowdsourced building data are abundant but are less considered for change detection. for example, openstreetmap (osm), google map, and gaode map provide lots of available building labels, yet they usually contain noise such as false alarms, omissions, and mismatches, limiting their wide application. in addition, when the building extraction task is transferred to the building change detection task, the temporal and regional differences between different images may lead to undesired pseudo changes. given these issues, we propose a full-level fused cross-task transfer learning method for building change detection using only crowdsourced building labels and high-resolution satellite imagery. the method consists of three steps: 1) noise-robust building extraction network pretraining; 2) uncertainty-aware pseudo label generation; and 3) fulllevel fused building change detection. we created building extraction and building change detection datasets. the former (building extraction dataset) contains 30 scenes of zy-3 images covering 27 major cities in china and crowdsourced building labels from gaode map for training, while the latter (building change dataset) contains bi-temporal zy-3 images in shanghai and beijing for testing. the results show that the proposed method can identify changed buildings more effectively and better balance false alarms and omissions, compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. further analysis indicates that the inclusion of samples from multiple cities with various spatial heterogeneities is helpful to improve the performance. the experiments show that it is promising to apply the proposed method to situations where true labels are completely lacking or limited, thus alleviating the issue of high label acquisition cost. the source code will be available at https://github.com/laura set/ffctl.",AB_0017
"the existing deraining methods based on convolutional neural networks (cnns) have made great success, but some remaining rain streaks can degrade images drastically. in this work, we proposed an end-to-end multi-scale context information and attention network, called mscianet. the proposed network consists of multi-scale feature extraction (msfe) and multi-receptive fields feature extraction (mrffe). firstly, the msfe can pick up features of rain streaks in different scales and propagate deep features of the two layers across stages by skip connections. secondly, the mrffe can refine details of the background by attention mechanism and the depthwise separable convolution of different receptive fields with different scales. finally, the fusion of these outputs of two subnetworks can reconstruct the clean background image. extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed network achieves a good effect on the deraining task on synthetic and real-world datasets. the demo can be available at https://github.com/coderli365/mscianet.",AB_0017
"breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. early signs of breast cancer can be an abnormality depicted on breast images (e.g., mammography or breast ultrasonography). however, reliable interpretation of breast images requires intensive labor and physicians with extensive experience. deep learning is evolving breast imaging diagnosis by introducing a second opinion to physicians. however, most deep learning-based breast cancer analysis algorithms lack interpretability because of their black box nature, which means that domain experts cannot understand why the algorithms predict a label. in addition, most deep learning algorithms are formulated as a single-task-based model that ignores correlations between different tasks (e.g., tumor classification and segmentation). in this paper, we propose an interpretable multitask information bottleneck network (mib-net) to accomplish simultaneous breast tumor classification and segmentation. mib-net maximizes the mutual information between the latent representations and class labels while minimizing information shared by the latent representations and inputs. in contrast from existing models, our mib-net generates a contribution score map that offers an interpretable aid for physicians to understand the model's decision-making process. in addition, mib-net implements multitask learning and further proposes a dual prior knowledge guidance strategy to enhance deep task correlation. our evaluations are carried out on three breast image datasets in different modalities. our results show that the proposed framework is not only able to help physicians better understand the model's decisions but also improve breast tumor classification and segmentation accuracy over representative state-of-the-art models. our code is available at https://github.com/jxw0810/mib-net.",AB_0017
"detecting pedestrians is a challenging computer vision task, especially in the intelligent transportation system. mainstream pedestrian detection methods purely utilize information of bounding boxes, which overlooks the role of other valuable attributes (e.g., head, head-shoulders, and keypoints) of pedestrians and leads to sub-optimal solutions. some works leveraged these valuable attributes with a minor performance improvement at the expense of increased computational complexity during the inference phase. to alleviate this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective method, namely detachable crowd density estimation assisted pedestrian detection (ddad), which leverages the crowd density attributes to assist pedestrian detection in the real-world scenes (e.g., crowded scenes and small-scale pedestrian scenes). the advantage of the crowd density estimation is that it allows the network to focus more on the human head and the small-scale pedestrians, which improves the features representation of pedestrians heavily occluded or far from cameras. our ddad works on a principle of multi-task learning and can be seamlessly applied to both one-stage and two-stage pedestrian detectors by equipping them with an extra detachable branch of crowd density estimation. the equipped crowd density estimation branch is trained with the annotations derived from the existing pedestrian bounding box annotations, occurring no extra annotation cost. moreover, it can be removed during the inference phase without sacrificing the inference speed. extensive experiments conducted on two challenging datasets, i.e., crowdhuman and citypersons, demonstrate that our proposed ddad achieves a significant improvement upon the state-of-the-art methods. code is available at https://github.com/scut-bip-lab/ ddad.",AB_0017
