"background hip fractures are associated with a high risk of death; among those who survive a hip fracture, many experience substantial decreases in quality of life. a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology and burden of hip fractures by country, age, gender, and sociodemographic factors would provide valuable information for healthcare policymaking and clinical practice. the global burden of disease (gbd) study 2019 was a global-level study estimating the burden of 369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories. an exploration and additional analysis of the gbd 2019 would provide a clearer picture of the incidence and burden of hip fractures. questions/purposes using data from the gbd 2019, we asked, (1) what are the global, regional, and national incidences of hip fractures, and how did they change over a recent 30-year span? (2) what is the global, regional, and national burden of hip fractures in terms of years lived with disability, and how did it change over that same period? (3) what is the leading cause of hip fractures? (4) how did the incidence and years lived with disability of patients with hip fractures change with age, gender, and sociodemographic factors? methods this was a cross-sectional study. participant data were obtained from the gbd 2019 (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool). the gbd study is managed by the who, coordinated by the institute of health metrics and evaluation, and funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation. it estimates the burden of disease and injury for 204 countries by age, gender, and sociodemographic factors, and can serve as a valuable reference for health policymaking. all estimates and their 95% uncertainty interval (ui) were produced using dismod-mr 2.1, a bayesian meta-regression tool in the gbd 2019. in this study, we directly pulled the age-standardized incidence rate and years lived with disability rate of hip fractures by location, age, gender, and cause from the gbd 2019. based on these data, we analyzed the association between the incidence rate and latitude of each country. then, we calculated the estimated annual percentage change to represent trends from 1990 to 2019. we also used the spearman rank-order correlation analysis to determine the correlation between the incidence or burden of hip fractures and the sociodemographic index, a composite index of the income per capita, average years of educational attainment, and fertility rates in a country. results globally, hip fracture incidences were estimated to be 14.2 million (95% ui 11.1 to 18.1), and the associated years lived with disability were 2.9 million (95% ui 2.0 to 4.0) in 2019, with an incidence of 182 (95% ui 142 to 231) and 37 (95% ui 25 to 50) per 100,000, respectively. a strong, positive correlation was observed between the incidence rate and the latitude of each country (rho = 0.65; p < 0.001). from 1990 to 2019, the global incidence rate for both genders remained unchanged (estimated annual percentage change 0.01 [95% confidence interval -0.08 to 0.11]), but was slightly increased in men (estimated annual percentage change 0.11 [95% ci 0.01 to 0.2]). the years lived with disability rate decreased slightly (estimated annual percentage change 0.66 [95% ci -0.73 to -0.6]). these rates were standardized by age. falls were the leading cause of hip fractures, accounting for 66% of all patients and 55% of the total years lived with disability. the incidence of hip fractures was tightly and positively correlated with the sociodemographic index (rho 0.624; p < 0.001), while the years lived with disability rate was slightly negatively correlated (rho -0.247; p < 0.001). most hip fractures occurred in people older than 70 years, and women had higher incidence rate (189.7 [95% ui 144.2 to 247.2] versus 166.2 [95% ui 133.2 to 205.8] per 100,000) and years lived with disability (38.4 [95% ui 26.9 to 51.6] versus 33.7 [95% ui 23.1 to 45.5] per 100,000) than men. conclusion hip fractures are common, devastating to patients, and economically burdensome to healthcare systems globally, with falls being the leading cause. the age-standardized incidence rate has slightly increased in men. many low-latitude countries have lower incidences, possibly because of prolonged sunlight exposure. policies should be directed to promoting public health education about maintaining bone-protective lifestyles, enhancing the knowledge of osteoporosis management in young resident physicians and those in practice, increasing the awareness of osteoporosis screening and treatment in men, and developing more effective antiosteoporosis drugs for clinical use.",AB_0169
"objective after deep brain stimulation (dbs), patients with parkinson's disease (pd) show improved motor symp-toms and decreased verbal fluency, an effect that occurs before the initiation of dbs in the subthalamic nucleus. how- ever, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. this study aimed to evaluate the effects of dbs on whole-brain degree centrality (dc) and seed-based functional connectivity (fc) in pd patients.methods the authors obtained resting-state functional mri data of 28 pd patients before and after dbs surgery. all patients underwent mri scans in the off-stimulation state. the dc method was used to evaluate the effects of dbs on whole-brain fc at the voxel level. seed-based fc analysis was used to examine network function changes after dbs.results after dbs surgery, pd patients showed significantly weaker dc values in the left middle temporal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus, but significantly stronger dc values in the midbrain, left precuneus, and right precentral gyrus. fc analysis revealed decreased fc values within the default mode network (dmn).conclusions this study demonstrated that the dc of dmn-related brain regions decreased in pd patients after dbs surgery, whereas the dc of the motor cortex increased. these findings provide new evidence for the neural effects of dbs on voxel-based whole-brain networks in pd patients. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.9.jns221640",AB_0169
"face editing generates a face image with the target attributes without changing the identity or other information. current methods have achieved considerable performance; however, they cannot effectively retain the face's identity and semantic information while controlling the attribute intensity. inspired by two human cognitive characteristics, namely, the principle of global precedence and the principle of homology continuity, we propose a novel face editing approach called the information retention and intensity control generative adversarial network (iricgan). it includes a learnable hierarchical feature combination (hfc) function, which can construct a sample's source space through multiscale feature mixing; it can guarantee the integrity of the source space while significantly compressing the network. additionally, the attribute regression module (arm) can decouple different attribute paradigms in the source space to ensure the correct modification of the required attributes and preserve the other areas. the gradual process of modifying the face attributes can be simulated by applying different control strengths in the source space. in face editing experiments, both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that iricgan achieves the best overall results among state-of-the-art alternatives. target attributes can be continuously modified by refeeding the relationship of the source space and the image, and the independence of each attribute can be retained to the greatest extent. iricgan:https://github.com/nanfangzhe/iricgan.",AB_0169
"automatic and periodic recompiling of building databases with up-to-date high-resolution images has become a critical requirement for rapidly developing urban environments. however, the architecture of most existing approaches for change extraction attempts to learn features related to changes but ignores objectives related to buildings. this inevitably leads to the generation of significant pseudo-changes, due to factors such as seasonal changes in images and the inclination of building facades. to alleviate the above-mentioned problems, we developed a contrastive learning approach by validating historical building footprints against single up-to-date remotely sensed images. this contrastive learning strategy allowed us to inject the semantics of buildings into a pipeline for the detection of changes, which is achieved by increasing the distinguishability of features of buildings from those of non-buildings. in addition, to reduce the effects of inconsistencies between historical building polygons and buildings in up-to-date images, we employed a deformable convolutional neural network to learn offsets intuitively. in summary, we formulated a multi-branch building extraction method that identifies newly constructed and removed buildings, respectively. to validate our method, we conducted comparative experiments using the public wuhan university building change detection dataset and a more practical dataset named si-bu that we established. our method achieved f1 scores of 93.99% and 70.74% on the above datasets, respectively. moreover, when the data of the public dataset were divided in the same manner as in previous related studies, our method achieved an f1 score of 94.63%, which surpasses that of the state-of-the-art method. code and datasets are available at https://vrlab.org.cn/similar to hanhu/projects/bcenet.",AB_0169
"the qpc-tdse program serves as a general tool to study laser-driven dynamics of electrons in ideal isolated atoms and molecules by solving the full-dimensional non-relativistic time-dependent schrodinger equation (tdse) within single-active-electron approximation. it expands the full-dimensional electronic wavefunction in spherical coordinates by spherical harmonics and b-spline functions and employs a set of parallel crank-nicolson propagators combined with split-operator techniques to evolve the wavefunction in time, which support centrifugal and multi-polar static potentials to treat atomic and molecular scenarios and accepts arbitrary combinations of linearly or elliptically polarized lasers within the dipole approximation. the program is capable of extracting the photo-electron momentum distribution via t-surff approach or projection onto either the exact scattering states or the planewaves. its applications in different scenarios are given as examples, e.g., above threshold ionization, attosecond clock, higher -order harmonic generation. program summary program title: qpc-tdse cpc library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /xjm3kfgv75 .1 licensing provisions: gplv3 programming language: c++ external libraries: hdf5, gsl, mkl nature of problem: numerical solution of tdse and extraction of various types of electron spectrum. solution method: the electronic wavefunction is expanded by b-spline functions and spherical harmonics whose range is chosen elaborately to reduce the total number of partial waves for non-linearly polarized lasers. the crank-nicolson approach combined with an operator-splitting scheme is used to propagate the wavefunction in time, either in velocity gauge or length gauge. matrix inversions are solved via either dense or sparse linear algebra solvers according to their structures. the t-surff method and projections onto either the scattering states or planewaves are provided for the accurate extraction of the momentum distributions. additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: only lasers within dipole approximation are supported. for the multi-polar potentials, only pure coulombic ones are supported. routines for solving exact scattering states have only been implemented for centrifugal potentials. the codes are written in c++17 and can only be compiled on the platforms that support the avx instruction sets. an extension for the propagation algorithm using the avx-512 intrinsics is provided as optional.

"land surface temperature (lst) is a key variable for monitoring and evaluating global long-term climate change. however, existing satellite-based twice-daily lst products only date back to 2000, which makes it difficult to obtain robust long-term temperature variations. in this study, we developed the first global historical twice-daily lst dataset (gt-lst), with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees, using advanced very high resolution radiometer (avhrr) level-1b global area coverage (gac) data from 1981 to 2021. the gt-lst product was generated using four main processes: (1) gac data reading, calibration, and preprocessing using opensource python libraries; (2) cloud detection using the avhrr-phase i algorithm; (3) land surface emissivity estimation using an improved method considering annual land cover changes; (4) lst retrieval based on a nonlinear generalized split-window algorithm. validation with in situ measurements from surface radiation budget (surfrad) sites and baseline surface radiation network sites showed that the overall root-mean-square errors (rmses) of gt-lst varied from 1.6 to 4.0 k, and nighttime lsts were typically better than daytime lsts. intercomparison with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer lst products (myd11a1 and myd21a1) revealed that the overall root-mean-square difference (rmsd) was approximately 3.0 k. compared with myd11a1 lst, gt-lst was overestimated, and relatively large rmsds were obtained during the daytime, spring, and summer, whereas the significantly smaller positive bias was obtained between gt-lst and myd21a1 lst. furthermore, we compared our newly generated dataset with a global avhrr daytime lst product at the selected measurements of surfrad sites (i.e., measurements of these two satellite datasets were valid), which revealed similar accuracies for the two datasets. however, gt-lst can additionally provide night-time lst, which can be combined with daytime observations estimating relatively accurate monthly mean lst, with an rmse of 2.7 k. finally, we compared gt-lst with a regional twice-daily avhrr lst product over continental africa in different seasons, with rmsds ranging from 2.1 to 4.3 k. considering these advantages, the proposed dataset provides a better data source for a range of research applications. gt-lst is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7113080 (1981-2000) (li et al., 2022a), https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7134158 (2001-2005) (li et al., 2022b), and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7813607 (2006-2021) (j. h. li et al., 2023).",AB_0169
"objective ponv reduces patient satisfaction and increases hospital costs as patients remain in the hospital for longer durations. in this study, we build a preliminary artificial intelligence algorithm model to predict early ponv in patients. methods we use r for statistical analysis and python for the machine learning prediction model. results average characteristic engineering results showed that haloperidol, sex, age, history of smoking, and history of ponv were the first 5 contributing factors in the occurrence of early ponv. test group results for artificial intelligence prediction of early ponv: in terms of accuracy, the four best algorithms were cnnrnn (0.872), decision tree (0.868), svc (0.866) and adab (0.865); in terms of precision, the three best algorithms were cnnrnn (1.000), adab (0.400) and adab (0.868); in terms of auc, the top three algorithms were logistic regression (0.732), svc (0.731) and adab (0.722). finally, we built a website to predict early ponv online using the streamlit app on the following website: (https://zhouchengmao-streamlit-app-lsvc-ad-st-app-lsvc-adab-ponv-m9ynsb.streamlit.app/). conclusion artificial intelligence algorithms can predict early ponv, whereas logistic regression, svc and adab were the top three artificial intelligence algorithms in overall performance. haloperidol, sex, age, smoking history, and ponv history were the first 5 contributing factors associated with early ponv.",AB_0169
"purpose - the purpose of this study is to prepare znfe2o4 nanospheres, sheet mos2 and three znfe2o4@mos2 core-shell composites with various shell thicknesses, and add them to the base oil for friction and wear tests to simulate the wear conditions of hybrid bearings. design/methodology/approach - through the characterization and analysis of the morphology of wear scars and the elemental composition of friction films, the tribological behavior and wear mechanism of sample materials as lubricant additives were investigated and the effects of shell thickness and sample concentration on the tribological properties of core-shell composite lubricant additives were discussed. findings - the findings demonstrate that each of the five sample materials can, to varying degrees, enhance the lubricating qualities of the base oil and that the core-shell nanocomposite sample lubricant additive has superior lubricating properties to those of znfe2o4 and mos2 alone, among them znfe2o4@mos2-2 core-shell composites with moderate shell thickness performed most ideally. in addition, the optimal concentration of the znfe2o4@mos2 lubricant additive was 0.5 wt.%, and a concentration that was too high led to particle deposition and affected the friction effect. originality/value - in this work, znfe2o4@mos2 core-shell composites were synthesized for the first time using znfe2o4 as the carrier and the lubrication mechanism of core-shell composites and single materials were compared and studied, which illustrated the advantages of core-shell composite lubricant additives. at the same time, the influence of different shell thicknesses on the lubricant additives of core-shell composites was studied. peer review - the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ilt-12-2022-0367/",AB_0169
"the suborder phacopina, characterized by schizochroal eyes, is among the most common groups of trilobites in devonian strata. the marine sediments of the famennian in western junggar, xinjiang, contain abundant low-disparity phacopids, which have previously been designated to omegops accipitrinus mobilis, phacops circumspectans tuberculosus, and omegops cornelius on the basis of small numbers of poorly preserved specimens. in this study, these phacopids were identified as two new species of omegops, o. honggulelengensis n. sp. and o. xiangi n. sp., on the basis of nearly 200 well-preserved specimens. the intraspecific variations of eye lenses of these specimens were quantitatively analyzed. on the basis of differences in the total number, number of dorsoventral files, and arrangement of the eye lenses, the absence of lenses in the middle part of the visual surface, and asymmetry of the number and/or arrangement of lenses in the two eyes, it was concluded that the reasons for intraspecific variation in eye lenses of late devonian omegops from western junggar were different from previously described factors but were likely genetic or embryological malfunctions or abnormalities caused by pathological conditions. diversity of lenses in the schizochroal eyes shows that the number and arrangement of eye lenses was not stable in phacopina. therefore, many specimens are needed for quantitative study to determine the true characteristics of the number or arrangement of eye lenses when these features are used in the systematic taxonomy of phacopina.uuid: http://zoobank.org/6bd14390-05fe-45ad-8eeb-3bf397a46a68",AB_0169
"antimicrobial peptides (amps) called host defense peptides have existed among all classes of life with 5-100 amino acids generally and can kill mycobacteria, envelop viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancerous cells and so on. owing to the non-drug resistance of amp, it has been a wonderful agent to find novel therapies. therefore, it is urgent to identify amps and predict their function in a high-throughput way. in this paper, we propose a cascaded computational model to identify amps and their functional type based on sequence-derived and life language embedding, called ampfinder. compared with other state-of-the-art methods, ampfinder obtains higher performance both on amp identification and amp function prediction. ampfinder shows better perfor-mance with improvement of f1-score (1.45%-6.13%), mcc (2.92%-12.86%) and auc (5.13%-8.56%) and ap (9.20%-21.07%) on an independent test dataset. and ampfinder achieve lower bias of r2 on a public dataset by 10-fold cross-validation with an improvement of (18.82%-19.46%). the comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that amp can accurately identify amp and its function types. the datasets, source code and user-friendly application are available at https://github.com/abcair/ampfinder.",AB_0169
