"the numerical implementation of advanced plastic damage models has been challenging due to the diverse computational difficulties caused by material nonlinearity. in this study, firstly, a plastic damage model is developed by a nonsmoothed mohr-coulomb yield criterion. the nonorthogonal flow rule without plastic potential function is employed to describe the dilatancy behavior of concrete. the stiffness degradation is considered through two tensile and compressive damage variables. subsequently, an implicit stress update algorithm incorporating several advanced numerical methods is proposed to tackle difficulties arising in the numerical calculation of the plastic damage model. in the model implementation, the mohr-coulomb yield function with corners is replaced by a single smooth expression to ensure the stability of the numerical calculation. a line search method is used to solve nonlinear systems of integral stress equations to obtain better convergence than newton method. the complex step derivative approximation is used to evaluate the consistent tangent operator to provide quadratic convergence speed of the global equilibrium iterations, thus avoiding tedious analytical derivative operations. the integral nonlocal method is also used to regularize the finite element solution. at the material point scale, the ability of the proposed model to describe the complex mechanical behavior of concrete is verified by utilizing nine sets of monotonic and cyclic loading and unloading tests. finally, the algorithm and model's performance is well tested by the failure analysis of five numerical examples. the code of this work will be freely available at https://github.com/zhouxin615/pd_model. & copy; 2023 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",AB_0161
"cancer drug response prediction based on genomic information plays a crucial role in modern pharmacogenomics, enabling individualized therapy. given the expensive and complexity of biological experiments, computational methods serve as effective tools in predicting cancer drug sensitivity. in this study, we proposed a novel method called multi-omics integrated collective variational autoencoders (moicvae), which leverages integrated omics knowledge, including genomic and transcriptomic data, to fill in missing cancer-drug associations and enhance drug sensitivity prediction. our method employs an encoder-decoder network to learn latent feature representations from cell lines. these learned feature vectors are then fed into a collective variational autoencoder network to train an association matrix. we evaluated moicvae on the gdsc and ccle benchmark datasets using 10-fold cross-validation and achieved impressive aucs of 0.856 and 0.808, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. furthermore, on the tcga dataset, consisting of 25 drugs across 7 cancer types, moicvae exhibited an average auc of 0.91 in predicting drug sensitivity. additionally, significant differences were observed in survival, tumor inflammatory assessment, and tumor microenvironment between the predicted drug-sensitive and drug-resistant groups. these results are consistent with predictions made on the metabric dataset. moreover, we discovered that fusing omics data based on mrna and cnv (copy number variations) yielded superior results in drug sensitivity prediction. moicvae not only achieved higher accuracy in drug sensitivity prediction but also provided additional value for combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy, offering patients with more precise treatment options. the code and dataset for moicvae are freely available at https://github.com/wanggnoc/moicvae.",AB_0161

"background the dose-effect relationship of long-snake-like moxibustion for chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) remains poorly understood. in order to address this gap, we designed this trial to assess the association between different treatment duration of long-snake-like moxibustion and its effects on cfs based on the combination measurements of the subjective patient-reported scales with objective medical infrared imaging technology-thermal texture maps (ttm). methods from december 2020 to january 2022, 60 female cfs patients were recruited and equally allocated to two groups: group a, receiving 60-min long-snake-like moxibustion per treatment, and group b, receiving 30-min long-snake-like moxibustion per treatment. the treatment was administered 3 times per week for a total of 4 weeks. the primary outcome was defined as the improvement of symptoms measured by the fatigue scale-14 (fs-14), and secondary outcomes were designated as the improvement in symptoms scale of spleen-kidney yang deficiency, self-rating depression scale, and self-rating anxiety scale. ttm scanning was employed twice for cfs patients (before and after 4-week treatment) and once for healthy control subjects (hcs). results at week 4, the scores of fs-14 and symptoms scale of spleen-kidney yang deficiency in group a were significantly lower than those in group b (physical fatigue: 5.00 vs. 6.00, with 95%ci - 2.00 to 0.00, p = 0.003; fs-14 total score: 8.00 vs. 9.00, with 95%ci - 3.00 to 0.00, p = 0.012; total score of symptoms scale of spleen-kidney yang deficiency: 9.80 vs. 13.07, with 95%ci - 5.78 to - 0.76, p = 0.012). all thermal radiation values of the two groups increased, and statistical differences in delta ts between group a and hcs were not obtained. more significant correlations between symptoms improvements and delta t changes were observed in group a, and its delta t changes in upper jiao, shenque (cv8), zhongwan (cv12), danzhong (cv17), zhiyang (gv9), dazhui (gv14), upper arm, thoracic segments, lumbar segments, renal region, popliteal fossa strongly correlated with the improvement of spleen-kidney yang deficiency symptoms. conclusions in the same course of treatment, the positive dose-effect relationship was found between the treatment duration of long-snake-like moxibustion and cfs effect assessment. 60-min long-snake-like moxibustion per treatment were associated with optimal clinical response and ttm improvement. trial registration chinese clinical trail registry (no. chictr2000041000, date of registration: 16 december 2020), http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=62488",AB_0161
"affected by organic matter and suspended particles in the underwater environment, underwater images suffer from information loss and low contrast, and the underwater images obtained by traditional visible light imaging techniques are not effective. based on this problem, a non-subsampled contourlet transform (nsct)-based underwater polarization image fusion method is proposed in this paper. first, we use a division of time polarimeter and polarization imaging technique to acquire underwater target images. then, the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm and the two-dimensional median filtering algorithm preprocess the visible image and the degree of polarization image, respectively. after that, the low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands of the images are decomposed by the non-subsampled contourlet transform. the fusion rule for the low-frequency sub-band adopts the adaptive fuzzy method. for the high-frequency sub-bands, the fusion rule of taking the larger absolute value in pixels is used. in the experiment, popular methods were used to compare the advantages of the proposed method. the experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in improving the evaluation indexes, such as information entropy, enhancement measure evaluation, contrast, average gradient, and standard deviation. and the visual effect is much more comfortable to observe. the method is an effective fusion algorithm that can be applied to multiple material targets to improve the quality of underwater polarization imaging. the code is available at a github repository at: https://github.com/si-yu12/underwater-polarization-image-fusion-based-on-nsct.

"background: chronic lung injury and dysregulated cellular homeostasis in response to particulate matter (pm) exposure are closely associated with adverse health effects. however, an effective intervention for preventing the adverse health effects has not been developed.objectives: this study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (nmn) supplementation on lung injury and elucidate the mechanism by which nmn improved immune function following subchronic pm exposure. methods: six-week-old male c57bl/6j mice were placed in a real-ambient pm exposure system or filtered air-equipped chambers (control) for 16 wk with or without nmn supplementation in drinking water (regarded as con-h2o, exp-h2o, con-nmn and exp-nmn groups, respectively) in shijiazhuang city, china (n = 20/group). the effects of nmn supplementation (500 mg/kg) on pm-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation were assessed, and its mechanism was characterized using single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scrna-seq) analysis of whole lung cells.results: the nmn-treated mice exhibited higher nad+ levels in multiple tissues. following 16-wk pm exposure, slightly less pulmonary inflammation and less collagen deposition were noted in mice with nmn supplementation in response to real-ambient pm exposure (exp-nmn group) compared with the exp-h2o group (all p < 0.05). mouse lung tissue isolated from the exp-nmn group was characterized by fewer neutrophils, monocyte-derived cells, fibroblasts, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells induced by subchronic pm exposure as detected by scrna-seq transcriptomic analysis. the improved immune functions were further characterized by interleukin-17 signaling pathway inhibition and lower secretion of pro fibrotic cytokines in the exp-nmn group compared with the exp-h2o group. in addition, reduced proportions of differentiated myofibroblasts and profibrotic interstitial macrophages were identified in the nmn-supplemented mice in response to pm exposure. furthermore, less immune function suppression and altered differentiation of pathological cell phenotypes nmn was related to intracellular lipid metabolism activation.discussion: our novel findings suggest that nmn supplementation mitigated pm-induced lung injury by regulating immune functions and improving lipid metabolism in male mice, providing a putative intervention method for prevention of human health effects associated with pm exposure. https:// doi.org/10.1289/ehp12259",AB_0161
"existing knowledge distillation approaches require task-related data to train portable student networks for satisfactory performance. nevertheless, in real-world applications, a majority of the data is unavailable over concerns about personal privacy, commercial confidentiality, etc. to mitigate the difficulty of acquiring the target dataset, the mainstream knowledge distillation methods generate training samples from the teacher network. however, the generated images still differ from the authentic ones, which limit the student network performance. to solve this issue, we propose a convenient and cost-negligible method to build datasets for training student networks. specifically, we crawl the data from the web without knowing any category of the target dataset, named irrelevant category crawler data (iccd). to prevent the performance collapse due to the data distribution gap between our iccd and the target dataset, we propose a pseudo-classification strategy and frequency-domain supervision (pcfs) for target category agnostic knowledge distillation with iccd. the pseudo-classification strategy classifies iccd into different pseudo-categories by the teacher network, and uniformly but randomly samples images from each pseudo-category to construct the pseudo-target dataset. furthermore, we transform the feature maps from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, and utilize the high- and low-frequency signals of the teacher network to impose strong constraints on the student network. extensive experiments conducted on various test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pcfs, which outperforms existing data-free methods and achieves comparable performance to those using the target training set. code is available at https://github.com/scut-bip-lab/pcfs-dfkd.",AB_0161
