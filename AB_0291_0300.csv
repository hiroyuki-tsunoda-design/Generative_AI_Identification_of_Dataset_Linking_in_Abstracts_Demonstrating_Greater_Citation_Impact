"crispr-cas base editing (be) system is a powerful tool to expand the scope and efficiency of genome editing with single-nucleotide resolution. the editing efficiency, product purity, and off-target effect differ among various be systems. herein, we developed crisprbase (http://crisprbase.maolab.org), by integrating 1 252 935 records of base editing outcomes in more than 50 cell types from 17 species. crisprbase helps to evaluate the putative editing precision of different be systems by integrating multiple annotations, functional predictions and a blasting system for single-guide rna sequences. we systematically assessed the editing window, editing efficiency and product purity of various be systems. intensive efforts were focused on increasing the editing efficiency and product purity of base editors since the byproduct could be detrimental in certain applications. remarkably, more than half of cancer-related off-target mutations were non-synonymous and extremely damaging to protein functions in most common tumor types. luckily, most of these cancer-related mutations were passenger mutations (4840/5703, 84.87%) rather than cancer driver mutations (863/5703, 15.13%), indicating a weak effect of off-target mutations on carcinogenesis. in summary, crisprbase is a powerful and convenient tool to study the outcomes of different base editors and help researchers choose appropriate be designs for functional studies.",AB_0030
"deciphering the fine-scale molecular mechanisms that shape the genetic effects at disease-associated loci from genome-wide association studies (gwas) remains challenging. the key avenue is to identify the essential molecular phenotypes that mediate the causal variant and disease under particular biological conditions. therefore, integrating gwas signals with context-specific quantitative trait loci (qtls) (such as different tissue/cell types, disease states, and perturbations) from extensive molecular phenotypes would present important strategies for full understanding of disease genetics. via persistent curation and systematic data processing of large-scale human molecular trait qtls (xqtls), we updated our previous qtlbase database (now qtlbase2, http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase ) to comprehensively analyze and visualize context-specific qtls across 22 molecular phenotypes and over 95 tissue/cell types. overall, the resource features the following major updates and novel functions: (i) 960 more genomewide qtl summary statistics from 146 independent studies; (ii) new data for 10 previously uncompiled qtl types; (iii) variant query scope expanded to fit 195 qtl datasets based on whole-genome sequencing; (iv) supports filtering and comparison of qtls for different biological conditions, such as stimulation types and disease states; (v) a new linkage disequilibrium viewer to facilitate variant prioritization across tissue/cell types and qtl types.",AB_0030

"the human leukocyte antigen (hla) system, or the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (mhc), is known for its extreme polymorphic nature and high heterogeneity. taking advantage of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data, we developed pgg. mhc to provide a platform to explore the diversity of the mhc in asia as well as in global populations. pgg. mhc currently archives high-resolution hla alleles of 53 254 samples representing 190 populations spanning 66 countries. pgg. mhc provides: (i) high-quality allele frequencies for eight classical hla loci (hla-a, -b, -c, -dqa1, -dqb1, -drb1, -dpa1 and -dpb1); (ii) visualization of population prevalence of hla alleles on global, regional, and country-wide levels; (iii) haplotype structure of 134 populations; (iv) two online analysis tools including 'hla imputation' for inferring hla alleles from snp genotyping data and 'hla association' to perform case/control studies for hla-related phenotypes and (v) east asian-specific reference panels for hla imputation. equipped with high-quality frequency data and user-friendly computer tools, we expect that the pgg. mhc database can advance the understanding and facilitate applications of mhc genomic diversity in both evolutionary and medical studies. the pgg. mhc database is freely accessible via https://pog.fudan.edu.cn/pggmhc or https://www.pggmhc.org/pggmhc.",AB_0030
"chromatin regulators (crs) regulate epigenetic patterns on a partial or global scale, playing a critical role in affecting multi-target gene expression. as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (chipseq) data associated with crs are rapidly accumulating, a comprehensive resource of crs needs to be built urgently for collecting, integrating, and processing these data, which can provide abundant annotated information on cr upstream and downstream regulatory analyses as well as cr-related analysis functions. this study established an integrative cr resource, named crdb (http://cr.liclab.net/crdb/), with the aim of curating a large number of available resources for crs and providing extensive annotations and analyses of crs to help biological researchers clarify the regulationmechanism and function of crs. the crdb database comprised a total of 647 crs and 2,591 chip-seq samples from more than 300 human tissues and cell types. these samples have been manually curated from ncbi geo/sra and encode. importantly, crdb provided the abundant and detailed genetic annotations in cr-binding regions based on chip-seq. furthermore, crdb sup- ported various functional annotations and upstream regulatory information on crs. in particular, it embedded four types of cr regulatory analyses: cr gene set enrichment, cr-binding genomic region annotation, cr-tf co-occupancy analysis, and cr regulatory axis analysis. crdb is a useful and powerful resource that can help in exploring the potential functions of crs and their regulatory mechanism in diseases and biological processes.",AB_0030
"cramdb (a database for composition and roles of animal microbiome) is a comprehensive resource of curated and consistently annotated metagenomes for non-human animals. it focuses on the composition and roles of the microbiome in various animal species. the main goal of the cramdb is to facilitate the reuse of animal metagenomic data, and enable cross-host and cross-phenotype comparisons. to this end, we consistently annotated microbiomes (including 16s, 18s, its andmetagenomics sequencing data) of 516 animals from 475 projects spanning 43 phenotype pairs to construct the database that is equipped with 9430 bacteria, 278 archaea, 2216 fungi and 458 viruses. cramdb provides two main contents: microbiome composition data, illustrating the landscape of the microbiota (bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) in various animal species, and microbiome association data, revealing the relationships between the microbiota and various phenotypes across different animal species. more importantly, users can quickly compare the composition of themicrobiota of interest cross-host or body site and the associated taxa that differ between phenotype pairs cross-host or cross-phenotype. cramdb is freely available at (http://www.ehbio.com/ cramdb).",AB_0030
"super-enhancers (ses) are cell-specific dna cisregulatory elements that can supervise the transcriptional regulation processes of downstream genes. sedb 2.0 (http://www.licpathway.net/sedb) aims to provide a comprehensive se resource and annotate their potential roles in gene transcriptions. compared with sedb 1.0, we have made the following improvements: (i) newly added the mouse ses and expanded the scale of human ses. sedb 2.0 contained 1 167 518 ses from 1739 human h3k27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (chipseq) samples and 550 226 ses from 931 mouse h3k27ac chip-seq samples, which was five times that of sedb 1.0. (ii) newly added transcription factor binding sites (tfbss) in ses identified by tf motifs and tf chip-seq data. (iii) added comprehensive (epi)genetic annotations of ses, including chromatin accessibility regions, methylation sites, chromatin interaction regions and topologically associating domains (tads). (iv) newly embedded and updated search and analysis tools, including `search se by tf-based', `differential-overlapping-se analysis' and `se-based tf-gene analysis'. (v) newly provided quality control (qc) metrics for chip-seq processing. in summary, sedb 2.0 is a comprehensive update of sedb 1.0, which curates more ses and annotation information than sedb 1.0. sedb 2.0 provides a friendly platform for researchers to more comprehensively clarify the important role of ses in the biological process.",AB_0030
"dna methylation, as the most intensively studied epigenetic mark, regulates gene expression in numerous biological processes including development, aging, and disease. with the rapid accumulation of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, integrating, archiving, analyzing, and visualizing those data becomes critical. since its first publication in 2015, methbank has been continuously updated to include more dna methylomes across more diverse species. here, we present methbank 4.0 (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ methbank/), which reports an increase of 309% in data volume, with 1449 single-base resolution methylomes of 23 species, covering 236 tissues/cell lines and 15 biological contexts. valueadded information, such as more rigorous quality evaluation, more standardized metadata, and comprehensive downstream annotations have been integrated in the new version. moreover, expert-curated knowledge modules of featured differentially methylated genes associated with biological contexts and methylation analysis tools have been incorporated as new components of methbank. in addition, methbank 4.0 is equipped with a series of new web interfaces to browse, search, and visualize dna methylation profiles and related information. with all these improvements, we believe the updated methbank 4.0 will serve as a fundamental resource to provide a wide range of data services for the global research community.",AB_0030
