"an ultimate objective in continual learning is to preserve knowledge learned in preceding tasks while learning new tasks. to mitigate forgetting prior knowledge, we propose a novel knowledge distillation technique that takes into the account the manifold structure of the latent/output space of a neural network in learning novel tasks. to achieve this, we propose to approximate the data manifold up to its first order, hence benefiting from linear subspaces to model the structure and maintain the knowledge of a neural network while learning novel concepts. we demonstrate that the modeling with subspaces provides several intriguing properties, including robustness to noise and therefore effective for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. we also discuss and show how our proposed method can be adopted to address both classification and segmentation problems. empirically, we observe that our proposed method outperforms various continual learning methods on several challenging datasets including pascal voc, and tiny-imagenet. furthermore, we show how the proposed method can be seamlessly combined with existing learning approaches to improve their performances. the codes of this article will be available at https://github.com/csiro-robotics/sdcl.& copy; 2023 the author(s). published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by license ().",AB_0089
"we present a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of the smacs j0723.3-7327 field ('webb's first deep field') obtained from jwst/niriss grism spectroscopy and supplemented with jwst/nirspec and vlt/muse redshifts. the catalogue contains a total of 190 sources with secure spectroscopic redshifts, including 156 niriss grism redshifts, 123 of which are for sources whose redshifts were previously unknown. these new grism redshifts are secured with two or more spectroscopic features (64 sources), or with a single spectral feature whose identity is secured from the object's nine-band photometric redshift (59 sources). these are complemented with 17 nirspec and 48 muse redshifts, including six new nirspec redshifts identified in this work. in addition to the z(cl) = 0.39 cluster galaxy redshifts (for which we provide similar to 40 new niriss absorption-line redshifts), we also find three prominent galaxy overdensities at higher redshifts - at z = 1.1, z = 1.4, and z = 2.0 - that were until now not seen in the jwst/nirspec and vlt/muse data. the paper describes the characteristics of our spectroscopic redshift sample and the methodology we have employed to obtain it. our redshift catalogue is made available to the community at https://niriss.github.io/smacs0723.",AB_0089
"diabetes mellitus has become a major public health concern associated with high mortality and reduced life expectancy and can cause blindness, heart attacks, kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and strokes. a new generation of antidiabetic peptides (adps) that act on beta-cells or t-cells to regulate insulin production is being developed to alleviate the effects of diabetes. however, the lack of effective peptide-mining tools has hampered the discovery of these promising drugs. hence, novel computational tools need to be developed urgently. in this study, we present adp-fuse, a novel two-layer prediction framework capable of accurately identifying adps or non-adps and categorizing them into type 1 and type 2 adps. first, we comprehensively evaluated 22 peptide sequence-derived features coupled with eight notable machine learning algorithms. subsequently, the most suitable feature descriptors and classifiers for both layers were identified. the output of these single-feature models, embedded with multiview information, was trained with an appropriate classifier to provide the final prediction. comprehensive cross-validation and independent tests substantiate that adp-fuse surpasses singlefeature models and the feature fusion approach for the prediction of adps and their types. in addition, the shapley additive explanation method was used to elucidate the contributions of individual features to the prediction of adps and their types. finally, a user-friendly web server for adp-fuse was developed and made publicly accessible (https://balalab-skku.org/adp-fuse), enabling the swift screening and identification of novel adps and their types. this framework is expected to contribute significantly to antidiabetic peptide identification.",AB_0089
"background: ds-5670a is a vaccine candidate for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) harnessing a novel modality composed of messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) encoding the receptor-binding domain (rbd) from the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) encapsulated in lipid nano particles. here, we report the safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetic profile of ds-5670a from a phase 2 clinical trial in healthy adults who were immunologically naive to sars-cov-2. methods: the study consisted of an open-label, uncontrolled, dose-escalation part and a double-blind, randomized, uncontrolled, 2-arm, parallel-group part. a total of 80 japanese participants were assigned to receive intramuscular ds-5670a, containing either 30 or 60 & mu;g of mrna, as two injections administered 4 weeks apart. safety was assessed by characterization of treatment-emergent adverse events (teaes). immunogenicity was assessed by neutralization titers against sars-cov-2, anti-rbd immunoglobulin (ig)g levels, and sars-cov-2 spike-specific t cell responses. plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of ds-5670a were also evaluated. results: most solicited teaes were mild or moderate with both the 30 and 60 & mu;g mrna doses. four participants (10 %) in the 60 & mu;g mrna group developed severe redness at the injection site, but all cases resolved without treatment. there were no serious teaes and no teaes leading to discontinuation. humoral immune responses in both dose groups were greater than those observed in human convalescent serum; the 60 & mu;g mrna dose produced better responses. neutralization titers were found to be correlated with anti-rbd igg levels (specifically igg1). ds-5670a elicited antigen-specific t helper 1-polarized cellular immune responses. conclusions: the novel mrna-based vaccine candidate ds-5670a provided favorable immune responses against sars-cov-2 with a clinically acceptable safety profile. confirmatory trials are currently ongoing to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ds-5670a as the primary vaccine and to assess the immunogenicity when administered as a heterologous or homologous booster. trial registry: https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jrct2071210086.",AB_0089
"the sf3b4 gene encodes a highly conserved protein that plays a critical role in mrna splicing. mutations in this gene are known to cause nager syndrome, a rare craniofacial disorder. although sf3b4 expression is detected in the optic vesicle before it is detected in the limb and somite, the role of sf3b4 in the eye is not well understood. this study investigated the function of sf3b4 in the retina by performing transcriptome profiles, immunostaining, and behavioral analysis of sf3b4-/- mutant zebrafish. results from this study suggest that dysregulation of the spliceosome complex affects not only craniofacial development but also retinogenesis. zebrafish lacking functional sf3b4 displayed characteristics similar to retinitis pigmentosa (rp), marked by severe retinal pigment epithelium defects and rod degeneration. pathway analysis revealed altered retinol metabolism and retinoic acid signaling in the sf3b4-/mutants. supplementation of retinoic acid rescued key cellular phenotypes observed in the sf3b4-/- mutants, offering potential therapeutic strategies for rp in the future. in conclusion, this study sheds light on the previously unknown role of sf3b4 in retinogenesis and provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of rp.

"during the past decade, cognitive neuroscience has been calling for population diversity to address the challenge of validity and generalizability, ushering in a new era of population neuroscience. the developing chinese color nest project (devccnp, 2013-2022), the first ten-year stage of the lifespan ccnp (2013-2032), is a two-stages project focusing on brain-mind development. the project aims to create and share a large-scale, longitudinal and multimodal dataset of typically developing children and adolescents (ages 6.0-17.9 at enrolment) in the chinese population. the devccnp houses not only phenotypes measured by demographic, biophysical, psychological and behavioural, cognitive, affective, and ocular-tracking assessments but also neurotypes measured with magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of brain morphometry, resting-state function, naturalistic viewing function and diffusion structure. this data descriptor introduces the first data release of devccnp including a total of 864 visits from 479 participants. herein, we provided details of the experimental design, sampling strategies, and technical validation of the devccnp resource. we demonstrate and discuss the potential of a multicohort longitudinal design to depict normative brain growth curves from the perspective of developmental population neuroscience. the devccnp resource is shared as part of the chinese data-sharing warehouse for in-vivo imaging brain in the chinese color nest project (ccnp) - lifespan brain-mind development data community (https://ccnp.scidb.cn) at the science data bank.",AB_0089
"recent days witness significant progress in various multi-modal tasks made by contrastive language-image pre-training (clip), a multi-modal large-scale model that learns visual representations from natural language supervision. however, the potential effects of clip on cross-modal hashing retrieval has not been investigated yet. in this paper, we for the first time explore the effects of clip on cross-modal hashing retrieval performance and propose a simple but strong baseline unsupervised contrastive multi-modal fusion hashing network (ucmfh). we first extract the off-the-shelf visual and linguistic features from the clip model, as the input sources for cross-modal hashing functions. to further mitigate the semantic gap between the image and text features, we design an effective contrastive multi-modal learning module that leverages a multi modal fusion transformer encoder supervising by a contrastive loss, to enhance modality interaction while improving the semantic representation of each modality. furthermore, we design a contrastive hash learning module to produce high-quality modal-correlated hash codes. experiments show that significant performance improvement can be made by our simple new unsupervised baseline ucmfh compared with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods. also, our experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of clip features on cross-modal hashing retrieval task compared to deep visual and linguistic features used in existing state-of-the-art methods. the source codes for our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/xinyuxia97/ucmfh.",AB_0089
"accurate auto-medical image segmentation, which is essential in disease diagnosis and treatment planning, has been significantly prospered by recent advances in convolution neural network (cnn) and transformer. however, pure cnn-based or pure transformer-base architectures exhibit limitations for segmentation tasks. for example, cnn fails to capture long-range relations due to fix receptive fields, and transformer ignores pixel-level spatial details of features. to address these challenges, we propose a novel parallel hybrid architecture for medical image segmentation, which is named cpt-unet (cross pyramid transformer u-shape network). cpt-unet may be the first attempt to exploit both the advantages of pyramid vision transformer (pvt) and cnn to the full by integrating them into the standard u-shape network to improve the segmentation performance and inference time. specifically, we design a parallel dual branch encoder and decoder in cpt-unet that consists of cnn and pvt. the input image is fed into the encoder of these two branches simultaneously to extract low-level spatial details and global contexts in a much shallower way. we design a novel fusion strategy to adequately utilize the multi-scale features extracted from cnn and pvt. we also add pvt in the decoder to better restore the segmentation map. experiments on two public segmentation datasets demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed cpt-unet over the comparison methods. the source code is available at https://github.com/shengyue007/cpt-unet.git.",AB_0089
