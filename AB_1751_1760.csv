"successful grasp is an important and long-standing issue for robots to interact with the real world. most recent studies have devoted more attention to stable grasp rather than functional grasp, which cannot guarantee task-oriented postgrasp manipulation. to achieve human-like functional grasp, a semantic representation of functional hand-object interaction is introduced without labeling 3d hand poses, and a novel coarse-to-fine grasp generation network is designed to model this hand-object interaction. first, a coarse grasp is generated by combining the global hand pose and hand grasp type. then, the fine pose will be optimized by guiding each finger to focus on the corresponding functional region of the object. experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving functional grasps for dexterous hands in the absence of high-dof grasp poses annotation of the hand. the project website is: https://github.com/zhangyb1008/functionalgrasp.",AB_0176
"the applicability of slam algorithms is largely limited to the assumption of scene rigidity. moreover, dynamic object perception is an essential technique for many robotic applications such as autonomous driving and multi-robot collaboration. in this letter, we present pointslot, an online, real-time and general stereo system that simultaneously performs slam and dynamic object tracking without any artificial priors. unlike previous slot systems, we explicitly identify moving and static objects by computing the object motion probabilities, such that features from static objects are utilized to improve the camera pose estimation instead of treating all object regions as outliers. based on the camera-centric parameterization for the object pose, the trajectories and dynamic landmarks of multi-keyframe objects are efficiently computed through an object-based bundle adjustment approach. the evaluations on kitti datasets and real-world experiments show that the proposed system achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art solutions on both camera motion estimation and dynamic object tracking. the open-source code is available at https://github.com/pkzhou/pointslot.",AB_0176
"effectively and accurately predicting the effects of interactions between proteins after amino acid mutations is a key issue for understanding the mechanism of protein function and drug design. in this study, we present a deep graph convolution (dgc) network-based framework, dgcddg, to predict the changes of protein-protein binding affinity after mutation. dgcddg incorporates multi-layer graph convolution to extract a deep, contextualized representation for each residue of the protein complex structure. the mined channels of the mutation sites by dgc is then fitted to the binding affinity with a multi-layer perceptron. experiments with results on multiple datasets show that our model can achieve relatively good performance for both single and multi-point mutations. for blind tests on datasets related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding with the sars-cov-2 virus, our method shows better results in predicting ace2 changes, may help in finding favorable antibodies. code and data availability: https://github.com/lennylv/dgcddg.",AB_0176
"advances in single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) technologies allow researchers to analyze the genome-wide transcription profile and to solve biological problems at the individual-cell resolution. however, existing clustering methods on scrna-seq suffer from high dropout rate and curse of dimensionality in the data. here, we propose a novel pipeline, scbkap, the cornerstone of which is a single-cell bisecting k-means clustering method based on an autoencoder network and a dimensionality reduction model mpdr. specially, scbkap utilizes an autoencoder network to reconstruct gene expression values from scrna-seq data to alleviate the dropout issue, and the mpdr model composed of the m3drop feature selection algorithm and the phate dimensionality reduction algorithm to reduce the dimensions of reconstructed data. the dimensionality-reduced data are then fed into the bisecting k-means clustering algorithm to identify the clusters of cells. comprehensive experiments demonstrate scbkap's superior performance over nine state-of-the-art single-cell clustering methods on 21 public scrna-seq datasets and simulated datasets. the source codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/yubinlab-qust/scbkap/ and ",AB_0176
"drug discovery and drug repurposing often rely on the successful prediction of drug-target interactions (dtis). recent advances have shown great promise in applying deep learning to drug-target interaction prediction. one challenge in building deep learning-based models is to adequately represent drugs and proteins that encompass the fundamental local chemical environments and long-distance information among amino acids of proteins (or atoms of drugs). another challenge is to efficiently model the intermolecular interactions between drugs and proteins, which plays vital roles in the dtis. to this end, we propose a novel model, gifdti, which consists of three key components: the sequence feature extractor (cnnformer), the global molecular feature extractor (gf), and the intermolecular interaction modeling module (iif). specifically, cnnformer incorporates cnn and transformer to capture the local patterns and encode the long-distance relationship among tokens (atoms or amino acids) in a sequence. then, gf and iif extract the global molecular features and the intermolecular interaction features, respectively. we evaluate gifdti on six realistic evaluation strategies and the results show it improves dti prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. moreover, case studies confirm that our model can be a useful tool to accurately yield low-cost dtis. the codes of gifdti are available at https://github.com/zhaoqichang/gifdti.",AB_0176
"drug repositioning (dr) is a strategy to find new targets for existing drugs, which plays an important role in reducing the costs, time, and risk of traditional drug development. recently, the matrix factorization approach has been widely used in the field of dr prediction. nevertheless, there are still two challenges: 1) learning ability deficiencies, the model cannot accurately predict more potential associations. 2) easy to fall into a bad local optimal solution, the model tends to get a suboptimal result. in this study, we propose a self-paced non-negative matrix tri-factorization (splnmtf) model, which integrates three types of different biological data from patients, genes, and drugs into a heterogeneous network through non-negative matrix tri-factorization, thereby learning more information to improve the learning ability of the model. in the meantime, the splnmtf model sequentially includes samples into training from easy (high-quality) to complex (low-quality) in the soft weighting way, which effectively alleviates falling into a bad local optimal solution to improve the prediction performance of the model. the experimental results on two real datasets of ovarian cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (aml) show that splnmtf outperforms the other eight state-of-the-art models and gets better prediction performance in drug repositioning. the data and source code are available at: https://github.com/qi0906/splnmtf.",AB_0176
"many infectious diseases are caused by bacterial pathogens. the pathogenic mechanisms of bacterial pathogens are complex and it is usually caused by virulence factors (vfs) in many cases. whether vfs exist is the main difference between the genomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. therefore, identification of vfs is of great significance for exploring the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. in this paper, we develop a new model for predicting vfs based on multiple features and deep learning. firstly, we used kmer, dipeptide deviation from expected mean (dde) and amino acid composition (aac) to extract features. and the deep model is constructed by integrating residual block and gated recurrent unit (gru). residual neural network is a kind of jump connection network to avoid gradient explosion or gradient disappearance, which is used to train deeper networks. two residual blocks, which are separated by relu activation function and batch normalization(bn) layer are used. finally, the combined features processed by resnet are input into the recurrent structure gru, and important information is filtered out through reset gate and update gate. the results of the proposed model are better than those of the existing methods by 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracy is 93.81% and 95.43%, respectively. it shows that the deep hybrid model for identifying virulence factors based on residual block and gate recurrent unit is effective and feasible. the codes and datasets are accessible at https://github.com/vfs625/prevfs-rg.git.",AB_0176
"from a systems biology perspective, genes usually work collaboratively in the form of a network, e.g., cancer -related genes participate in an integrative dysfunctional pathway. thus, feature gene selection considering the graph or network structure plays a crucial role in cancer biomarker discovery from high-throughput omics data. the network-based paradigm demonstrates that integrating gene expression data with gene networks can improve classification performances and generate more interpretable feature subsets. in this paper, we propose an embedded connected network-constrained support vector machine (cnet-svm) method to keep the selected features in an inherent graph structure in discovering biomarker genes. firstly, we mathematically formulate the cnet-svm model as a convex optimization problem constrained by network connectivity inequalities and theoretically investigate the behaviors of all tuning parameters to provide search guidance on the regularization path. secondly, to check if the genes selected by cnet-svm could be studied as network-structured biomarkers, we conduct experiments on several simulation datasets and real-world breast cancer (brca) datasets to validate its classification and prediction capabilities. the results show that cnet-svm not only maintains the sparsity and smoothness, but also considers the connectivity constraints between genes when selecting features on a prior gene-gene interaction network from omics data. especially, cnet-svm identifies 32 brca biomarker genes, which form into a connected network component and can be potentially used for brca diagnosis. furthermore, the comparisons with eight feature selection-empowered svm methods demonstrate that the easily interpretable networked feature genes discovered by cnet-svm are more closely related to brca dysfunctions. finally, we validate that the identified biomarkers achieve high prediction accuracy on external independent cohorts. all results proved that the proposed cnet-svm method is effective in selecting connected-network-structured features and can be an alternative improvement to the current svm models for biomarker identification from high-throughput data. the data and code are available at https://github.com/zpliulab/cnet-svm.",AB_0176
"in recent years, collecting data from iot devices by unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) has become a very hot research topic. this paper focuses on the energy consumption problem of a uav-based iot data collection system. to solve the considered energy consumption problem, this paper proposes a new population-based optimization algorithm called the backtracking search algorithm with dynamic population (bsadp), which can determine the optimal number and locations of stop points of the uav simultaneously. in addition, bsadp has a simple framework, which consists of the proposed enhanced backtracking search algorithm (ebsa) and the designed population adjustment mechanism with opposition-based learning (pamobl). in the search process, the population is regarded as the entire deployment of the uav. bsadp firstly generates the trail deployment of the uav by ebsa and then the next generation deployment of the uav is produced based on the trail deployment and pamobl. the performance of bsadp is investigated by two energy consumption formulations. experimental results support the superiority of bsadp in optimizing the deployment of the uav and prove the application value of bsadp in the real scenario. the source code of the proposed algorithm can be found from: https://github.com/jsuzyy/bsadp.",AB_0176
"phenotype-based prioritization of candidate genes and diseases has become a well-established approach for multi-omics diagnostics of rare diseases. most current algorithms exploit semantic analysis and probabilistic statistics based on human phenotype ontology and are commonly superior to naive search methods. however, these algorithms are mostly less interpretable and do not perform well in real clinical scenarios due to noise and imprecision of query terms, and the fact that individuals may not display all phenotypes of the disease they belong to. we present a phenotype-driven likelihood ratio analysis approach (phelr) assisting interpretable clinical diagnosis of rare diseases. with a likelihood ratio paradigm, phelr estimates the posterior probability of candidate diseases and how much a phenotypic feature contributes to the prioritization result. benchmarked using simulated and realistic patients, phelr shows significant advantages over current approaches and is robust to noise and inaccuracy. to facilitate clinical practice and visualized differential diagnosis, phelr is imple-mented as an online web tool (https://phelr.nbscn.org).",AB_0176
