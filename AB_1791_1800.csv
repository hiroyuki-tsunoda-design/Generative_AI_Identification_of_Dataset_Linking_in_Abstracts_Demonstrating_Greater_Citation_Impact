"introduction: vascular calcification (vc) is more likely to be detected in the chronic kidney disease (ckd) population. the mechanism of vc development from ckd is different from that for simple vc and has always been a major research area. the aim of this study was to detect alterations in the metabolome during development of vc in ckd and to identify the critical metabolic pathways and metabolites involved in its pathogenesis. methods: rats in the model group were given an adenine gavage combined with a high-phosphorus diet to imitate vc in ckd. the aorta calcium content was measured and used to divide the model group into a vc group and non-vascular calcification group (non-vc group). the control group was fed a normal rat diet and given a saline gavage. ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (uhplc-ms) was used to determine the altered serum metabolome in the control, vc, and non-vc groups. the identified metabolites were mapped into the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) for pathway and network analyses. result: there were 14 metabolites that changed significantly in the vc group, with three metabolic pathways playing critical roles in the pathogenesis of vc in ckd: steroid hormone biosynthesis; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; and pantothenate and coa biosynthesis. conclusion: our results indicated changes in the expression of steroid sulfatase and estrogen sulfotransferase, and down-regulation of the in situ synthesis of estrogens in the vc group. in conclusion, the serum metabolome alters significantly during the pathogenesis of vc in ckd. the key pathways, metabolites, and enzymes we identified are worth further study and may become a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of vc in ckd.",AB_0180
"objective: assessing the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (mbsr) on symptoms of osa, especially on the primary outcome, excessive daytime sleepiness (eds).methods: parallel randomized controlled trial. 16 osa patients with residual eds (reds) were random-ized and assigned to either a standardized 8-week mbsr program or a time-matched program on acceptance and commitment therapy (act). both programs were conducted online. participants answered questionnaires online at baseline (pre), post-intervention (post), three months after the intervention (follow-up) and were blinded to whether their group was the treatment or active control group but not to group allocation (partial blinding). three participants dropped out early. most analyses are based on the remaining 13 patients.results: there was a significant difference between the mbsr (n = 7) and act group (n = 6) in changes of eds between pre and post (cohen's d = 1.24, ci [0.01, 2.42]) and a significant reduction of eds for pa-tients in the act group at post (cohen's d = 1.18 and [0.08, 2.22]). this eds reduction averaging 2.17 points on the epworth sleepiness scale reached the prespecified bar for clinical significance of two points on that scale. insomnia symptoms, a secondary outcome, reduced significantly following act (cohen's d = 1.43 [0.23, 2.58]). in mbsr, both participants and the mbsr-trainer judged movement-based exer-cises to be most efficacious.conclusion: act shows potential as adjunctive therapy for osa with reds, although further studies are needed. it seems promising to develop therapeutic approaches for osa with reds using act, especially if they are tailored to the needs specific to this patient group. trial registration: https://www.drks.de; identifier: drks00026812.

"retrosynthesis prediction, the task of identifying reactant molecules that can be used to synthesize product molecules, is a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry and related fields. to address this challenge, we propose a novel graph-to-graph transformation model, g2gt. the model is built on the standard transformer structure and utilizes graph encoders and decoders. additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of self-training, a data augmentation technique that utilizes unlabeled molecular data, in improving the performance of the model. to further enhance diversity, we propose a weak ensemble method, inspired by reaction-type labels and ensemble learning. this method incorporates beam search, nucleus sampling, and top -k sampling to improve inference diversity. a simple ranking algorithm is employed to retrieve the final top-10 results. we achieved new state-of-the-art results on both the uspto-50k data set, with a top-1 accuracy of 54%, and the larger more challenging uspto-full data set, with a top-1 accuracy of 49.3% and competitive top-10 results. our model can also be generalized to all other graph-to-graph transformation tasks. data and code are available at https://github.com/anonnoname/g2gt_2",AB_0180
"pancreatitis is a relatively serious disease caused by the self-digestion of trypsin in the pancreas. the generation of diseases is closely related to gene and phenotype information. generally, gene-phenotype relations are mainly obtained through clinical experiments, but the cost is huge. with the amount of published biomedical literature increasing exponentially, it carries a wealth of disease-related gene and phenotype information. this study provided an effective way to obtain disease-related gene and phenotype information. to our best knowledge, this work first attempted to explore relationships between genotype and phenotype about the pancreatitis from the computational perspective. it mined 6152 genes and 76,753 pairs of genotype and phenotype extracted from the biomedical literature about pancreatitis using text mining. based on the above 76,753 pairs, the study proposed an improved normalized point-wise mutual information (rel-npmi) model to optimize gene-phenotype relations related to pancreatitis, and obtained 12,562 gene-phenotype pairs which may be related to pancreatitis. the extracted top 20 results were validated and evaluated. the experimental results show that the method is promising for exploring pancreatitis' molecular mechanism, thus it provides a computational way for studying pancreatitis' disease pathogenesis. data resources and the pancreatitis gene-phenotype association database are available at http://114.116.4.45:8081/and resources are also available at https://github.com/polipoptbe8023/ rel-npmi.git.",AB_0180
"resting-state fmri is commonly used to derive brain parcellations, which are widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpreting human neuroscience studies. we previously developed a model that integrates local and global approaches for estimating areal-level cortical parcellations. the resulting local-global parcel-lations are often referred to as the schaefer parcellations. however, the lack of homotopic correspondence between left and right schaefer parcels has limited their use for brain lateralization studies. here, we extend our previous model to derive homotopic areal-level parcellations. using resting-fmri and task-fmri across diverse scanners, acquisition protocols, preprocessing and demographics, we show that the resulting homotopic parcellations are as homogeneous as the schaefer parcellations, while being more homogeneous than five publicly available parcellations. furthermore, weaker correlations between homotopic parcels are associated with greater lateralization in resting network organization, as well as lateralization in language and motor task activation. finally, the homotopic parcellations agree with the boundaries of a number of cortical areas estimated from histology and visuotopic fmri, while capturing sub-areal (e.g., somatotopic and visuotopic) features. overall, these results suggest that the homotopic local-global parcellations represent neurobiologically meaningful subdivisions of the human cerebral cortex and will be a useful resource for future studies. multi-resolution parcellations estimated from 1479 participants are publicly available ( https://github.com/thomasyeolab/cbig/tree/master/stable _ projects/brain _ parcellation/yan2023 _ homotopic ).",AB_0180
"subspace clustering has attracted much attention on account of its excellent performance in various tasks, such as computer vision and pattern recognition. since the high-dimensional data may comprise redundant information and noises, low-dimensional subspace structure is difficult to be recovered exactly. existing methods adopt the non-convex schatten-p norm to approximate the rank function closer. however, these methods are still unable to handle each singular value flexibly, which may yield unsatisfactory solutions. to address this deficiency, in this paper, we propose a iterative reweighted frobenius norm regularized latent low rank representation (irfllrr) model, which can restrain the small and large rank components simultaneously with rational weights. specifically, the reweighting strategy can preserve the desirable structure information, while removing the sparse noise and redundant information. hence the constructed coefficient matrix can capture the global structure of data more adequately. to solve the proposed model, an efficient algorithm is developed via the alternating direction method of multipliers (admm), which ensures each subproblem can be optimized in closed-form. in addition, we provide detailed mathematical proofs to guarantee that the sequence generated by our algorithm convergences to a karush-kuhn-tucker (kkt) point. extensive experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods. matlab code is available at https://github.com/wangzhi-swu/irfllrr.",AB_0180
"video super-resolution methods focus on restoring high-resolution video frames from low-resolution videos with pre-defined degradations, and few consider compression. however, the videos on the internet are compressed to reduce the massive size of video data. thus, they also contain visual noises and artifacts due to the lossy compression. in this paper, we propose a video super-resolution model specific for compressed videos to suppress artifacts and restore high-resolution contents. we propose a two-stage super-resolution network for compressed videos that contains three new modules: cleanup and local alignment in the first stage, 3d -convolution temporal-spatial attention in the second stage. specifically, the cleanup module is designed in stage-1 to suppress the artifacts and noises of low-quality inputs. the subsequent local alignment is designed to aggregate adjacent frames to maintain high-frequency details. the 3d-convolution attention is used in stage-2 to refine the weights of the feature maps. in addition, we propose the new crfvideos dataset to facilitate fair comparisons, containing hevc/h.265 compressed videos of different compression levels. extensive experiments substantiate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the hevc/h.265 compressed benchmark with medium to high compression rates by 0.3-0.7 db in terms of psnr and exceeds state-of-the-art methods on benchmark vid4 by 0.2-0.8 db. the code will be released at https://github.com/cvygkhv/decompression.",AB_0180
"this paper presents a method to obtain inshore-ship angle based on lidar 3d point cloud data. when the inshore ship is berthing now, the compass equipment is usually used to get the angle information of the ship. this paper puts forward an idea of obtaining ship angle information through point cloud data by studying the characteristics of the ship hull and treating lidar signals when the ship is berthing. the point cloud data in the range of the ship hull was determined, and the angle information between ship and wharf was finally estimated through these point cloud data. in this paper, by establishing a 3d scene of the port, the point cloud data of ships berthing from multiple angles are simulated, and the algorithm is verified on these point cloud data. the results show that the maximum absolute error of the algorithm in this paper is 0.49 degrees, the root-mean-square error (rmse) is 0.27 degrees, the mean absolute error (mae) is 0.17 degrees, and our method is competitive with other existing inshore ship angle estimation methods. therefore, the method in this paper can effectively obtain the angle information of the ship when it is berthing and help the ship keep the parallel berthing as much as possible so that the berthing operation of the ship is safer. data is at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1msiqdonoxwwgtx2ps_4fae6mbplz4g7k?usp=sharing code is at: https://github.com/serendipitylxd/estimation-of-berthing-angle",AB_0180
"with the advancement of new technologies, a huge amount of high dimensional data is being generated which is opening new opportunities and challenges to the study of cancer and diseases. in particular, distinguishing the patient-specific key components and modules which drive tumorigenesis is necessary to analyze. a complex disease generally does not initiate from the dysregulation of a single component but it is the result of the dysfunction of a group of components and networks which differs from patient to patient. however, a patientspecific network is required to understand the disease and its molecular mechanism. we address this requirement by constructing a patient-specific network by sample-specific network theory with integrating cancerspecific differentially expressed genes and elite genes. by elucidating patient-specific networks, it can identify the regulatory modules, driver genes as well as personalized disease networks which can lead to personalized drug design. this method can provide insight into how genes are associating with each other and characterized the patient-specific disease subtypes. the results show that this method can be beneficial for the detection of patient-specific differential modules and interaction between genes. extensive analysis using existing literature, gene enrichment and survival analysis for three cancer types stad, paad and luad shows the effectiveness of this method over other existing methods. in addition, this method can be useful for personalized therapeutics and drug design. this methodology is implemented in the r language and is available at https://github.com/riasata zim/patientspecificrnanetwork.",AB_0180
"accurate identification of protein-protein interaction (ppi) sites is significantly important for understanding the mechanism of life and developing new drugs. however, it is expensive and time-consuming to identify ppi sites using wet-lab experiments. developing computational methods is a new road to identify ppi sites, which can accelerate the procedure of ppi-related research. in this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based method (called d-ppisite) to improve the accuracy of sequence-based ppi site prediction. in d-ppisite, four discriminative sequence-driven features, i.e., position specific scoring matrix, relative solvent accessibility, position information and physical properties, are employed to feed into a well-designed deep learning module, consisting of convolutional, squeeze and excitation, and fully connected layers, to learn a prediction model. to reduce the risk of a single prediction model getting stuck in local optima, multiple prediction models with different initialization parameters are selected and integrated into one final model using the mean ensemble strategy. experimental results on five independent testing data sets demonstrate that the proposed d-ppisite can achieve an average accuracy of 80.2% and precision of 36.9%, covering 53.5% of all ppi sites while achieving the average matthews correlation coefficient value (0.330) that is significantly higher than most of existing state-of-the-art prediction methods. we implement a new standalone-version predictor for predicting ppi sites, which is freely available at https://github.com/mingdongup/d-ppisite for academic use.",AB_0180
